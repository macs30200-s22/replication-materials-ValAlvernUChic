            ": Mdm Speaker, MOM received about 9,000 salary-related claims involving some 4,500 employers in 2016. So, 9,000 claims; 4,500 employers. Through mediation by MOM and adjudication by the Labour Court, we have been able to resolve more than 95% of these claims.",
            "The remaining 5% of the salary-related claims were unresolved because one of the employers has appealed the Labour Court order and the case is now with the High Court, eight are still in business but have yet to comply with their orders, while a vast majority − 199 out of 208 employers − had either ceased operation, or faced impending business closure due to financial difficulties. Therefore, out of the 208 employers, 199 either have closed down or are going to close down soon. We are left with only nine employers; one of whom is appealing against the Labour Court order, and eight who have yet to comply with the orders.",
            "All these companies have been debarred from hiring foreign workers until they comply with the Labour Court orders. The debarment also applies to culpable directors even if they were to start new companies.",
            "We are also investigating those employers who are still in business because non-payment of salary is an offence under the Employment Act. While it is not our intention to criminalise every non-payment of salary, especially if it is the result of a business failure, we do prosecute serious or repeated cases, for deterrence.",
            "In the last three years, 158 employers have been prosecuted and convicted for salary-related offences. Such offences carry a fine of between $3,000 and $15,000 per charge, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.",
            "Let me now turn to work injury cases. In 2016, over 99.9% of the approximately 16,000 injured workers had their cases successfully resolved. However, five, out of about 16,000 cases, did not because their employers had failed to purchase work injury compensation (WIC) insurance and were unable to pay due to financial difficulties. MOM takes such offences seriously and prosecutes such employers under the Work Injury Compensation Act and debars the companies and individual directors from hiring foreign workers, until they compensate their workers. Such offences carry a maximum penalty of $10,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both. In the last five years, 14 employers have been prosecuted for non-insurance and non-compensation of work injury.",
            "Madam, in most of the unresolved cases of unpaid salary or work injury compensation, the chance of workers recovering payments from their employers is slim. This is not because the employers could just ignore and refuse to pay up, but because they are mostly in deep financial difficulties as I have explained earlier.",
            "For cases where there is still some hope of enforcing the orders for unpaid salary or work-injury compensation, the workers are required to apply for the Writ of Seizure and Sale through the State Courts. This is the same process that applies to all unpaid Civil Court orders including those made by the State Courts. In other words, the Labour Court orders are not less enforceable compared to those issued or made by the State Courts. All civil claims have to go through the same process.",
            "For those who need help, MOM assists the workers by advising them on the process and preparing the necessary documents. Eligible low-wage local workers may seek legal assistance from the Legal Aid Bureau, whereas foreign workers may approach the Migrant Workers' Centre. Workers can also apply to the State Courts Registrar to waive or defer the costs of enforcing the order, or to recover these costs from the sale proceeds. Meanwhile, foreign workers with valid salary claims are also allowed to change employers. More than 2,200 of such requests were granted in the past three years.",
            "Mdm Speaker, while we are relieved that the vast majority of unpaid salary (95%) and Work Injury cases (99.9%) are successfully resolved, we are however concerned with workers who are unable to recover their claims because their employers no longer have the financial means to pay. We will continue to strengthen our support for them.",
            "Currently, foreign workers can already receive financial relief from the Migrant Workers' Centre. Likewise for local low-wage workers, as announced in this House in August last year, those with unresolved salary claims will be able to receive short-term relief from the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) when it comes into operation in April this year. As for workers with more serious injury, if they fail to receive their work injury compensation and are in financial difficulties, we will continue to assist them through the Workers' Fund, managed by MOM.",
            "On the part of the workers, I urge them to bring their cases to MOM as early as possible. This will greatly improve the chances of successfully resolving their claims before the employers reach dire financial straits."

            ": I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer and that he has got most of the ground covered. Just a couple of supplementary questions. First, for the upstream actions by MOM, is there a more certain way by which the Ministry can assure and ensure that the insurance coverage for both local and foreign employees are being covered. As it is, I think there seems to be a gap somewhere, where some of the employers did not have their workers covered and therefore some of the issues arose.",
            "The second question is downstream. Looking at the comprehensive slew of measures that the Minister has described, I am not sure if many people know about them, and is there a way by which MOM can facilitate and publicise a lot more on the actions that can be taken, especially for workers that are from foreign lands and who may not be cued in and the language might be an issue? I think there needs to be a lot more work to be done in communicating the slew of measures that Minister had mentioned. For example, I think the Minister is familiar with the cases that were mentioned about the Bangladeshi workers who had been told to —"

            ": Mdm Speaker, on the issue of insurance coverage for work injury, I want to assure the House that the compliance rate is high. And that is the reason why 99.9% of the cases had no problems. Out of the 16,000 cases, only five cases had problem. Having said that, we do take such non-compliance seriously. That is why for every single case of non-compliance and non-payment, even for the first-time offender, MOM would prosecute the employer. We do need to send a very clear message. Of course, some may wonder why MOM cannot ensure 100% coverage. Our challenge is that when a company purchases WICA coverage for its employees, the insurance policy does not go by name. It is a group insurance. Along the way, during the year, there are workers who leave the company and workers who join the company. As a result, the responsibility of making sure that workers are covered has to rest with the employer. It is impossible for MOM to comb through every WICA policy and to cross-check with the movement of staff and so on.",
            "Having said that, we want to assure this House that the compliance rate is high. For the five cases, all of the five employers have been or are being prosecuted.",
            "I also want to assure the House that we take every of these five cases very seriously. For the information of this House, these five cases involve four foreign workers and one local worker. For the four foreign workers, we continue to pursue the cases, and one employer has just paid up and another case is now with State Courts. We are also helping the workers to find employment in Singapore and at the same time, continue to find ways to resolve their outstanding claims. In the case of the local worker, we have started actions to enforce the payment.",
            "We are keeping track of these five cases to make sure that we derive the best outcome possible.",
            "In the case of the foreign workers mentioned by the Member, the media reports may have created a few misperceptions. First is that the media reports said that the employers could just ignore and refuse to pay. I want to assure this House, no employer can afford to ignore and refuse to pay. As far as MOM is concerned, if I assess that this employer has the ability to pay, we will pursue it to the fullest. I do not have to wait for the workers to enforce the order from the State Courts. As MOM, I am already able to prosecute the employers because non-payment of salary in itself is an offence. So, I want to assure this House, please do not go away with the impression that any employer out there can afford to refuse and ignore the Labour Court orders. I assure you, this has never been the case and we will make sure it will never happen in the future.",
            "Secondly, in this particular case, we did try very hard to help the worker. The issue is this − this worker has outstanding salary for 11 months. The employer stopped paying him in October 2015 and it took him 11 months to come to MOM. By the time he came to MOM, the company was already in serious trouble. Notwithstanding this, there were 10 workers involved. The employer made an offer − paid each and every one of them $2,000 as a partial payment, and through the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC), we offered to pay an ex-gratia payment of another $1,000. Every worker affected is guaranteed of at least $3,000; that is, $2,000 of partial payment from the employer, and $1,000 from the MWC. The rest of it, the employer promised that he would pay up in instalments, through best effort. Nine out of the 10 workers accepted this because they were realistic; they know the situation the company is in and they accepted it. At least two of them are now still working in Singapore with new employers.",
            "This particular claimant rejected the partial offer by the employer. He wanted to recover the full sum, which comes to about $7,500. As a result, he declined the offer by the employer. We are now in the process of helping him to file the claim and enforce the Labour Court order, knowing that the chance of recovery is very slim. The company has already ceased operations.",
            "I want to assure the House that we do take every case very seriously. What the workers can do, the best thing the workers can do to help themselves, is to come to us early. Eleven months is too long to wait, because by the time the employer has stopped paying you for 11 months, there is a high chance that the company is in deep financial difficulty. By and large, most workers will come to MOM after two to three months. As a result, we were able to resolve 95% of them.",
            "I also agree with Ms Denise Phua's point that we should step up more in terms of educating the employer, the workers and the members of public that in Singapore, we do take the welfare of our workers − whether foreign or local − very seriously. Salary is hard-earned money. Compensation for work injury is very important because when the worker is injured, it may affect his ability to work. To not pay him the compensation is unacceptable.",
            "I want to assure this House that we will continue to strengthen the system. Yes, I think the system today, by and large, is working well. Ninety-five percent for unpaid salary, 99.9% for work injury, but I can assure this House that we will come up with more measures to link them up with MWC."

This refers to directors who deserve blame for not paying salary regardless of whether it is due to negligence, intentional or otherwise. In other words, if you are a director of a company, and you have contributed to the non-payment of salary, the debarment applies to this director as well. So, this director can go on to open and start a new company, the debarment will follow him to the new company until he pays up the outstanding salary to the ex-employees."

I would like to follow up on what the Minister was saying about salaries being unpaid by employers who are in some financial problems. We are seeing some of those from our residents these days. They have noticed that for those employers that have their fair share of foreign workers as well as local, the foreign workers ironically, have a sort of a safety milestone in the sense that when the employer decides to cancel their work pass, I think MOM will have to make sure that the employer pays them what is due to them, in terms of salaries and all that.",
            "The shedding of foreign workers could come at an earlier stage whereas the local workers may continue to work in the firm. Some of our residents are seeing that this payment of the foreign workers, their full packages and so on when their work permits are cancelled, this could be something risky for them as local employees will continue while the company's situation deteriorates.",
            "So, I believe Minister did mention he is alive to the situation, so I would like to ask him whether the ministry is reviewing this framework to, for example, have a mechanism in place that where you see an employer starting to cancel passes of foreign workers and so on, that the company is still able to make their payments to the local workers who remain with the company."

What the MOM does is this. We always encourage our workers, \"The moment your employers stop paying you any salary, please come to us as early as you can\". This is our message and that remains our message.",
            "Ms Lim may wish to advise her residents that anytime when their employers stop paying them salary, they can come to MOM straightaway. They do not have to wait for two or three months. The moment it is overdue, you have the right to exercise that option. That is the best way."

If they were to sell the flat today, it is with the same policy. Nothing has changed. I think it is easy to point at the EIP as the cause for a lower sale price, but there may be many other reasons. Even in today's current market situation, there are people who are not subject to EIP limits, but are selling their flats at somewhat lower prices because of the general property market conditions. It is probably premature or not fair to point the finger at the EIP per se, but recognise that the property market conditions are the way they are. And buyers therefore need to plan ahead and think very carefully about these decisions."

Over the years, from 2014 to 2016, we received about 1,500 appeal cases and about four-fifths of them were rejected; which means that one-fifth were successful. I think this was in fact a question raised by one of the Members of the House which we had addressed and clarified. I cannot get into the specifics of which and why some cases are successful and others are not. Each case is unique and we look at it case by case. But for many of the cases that we have turned down, we have found that, in fact, if you look at the resale transactions, there were transactions from buyers of that particular ethnic group. So, it is not fair to say that there are no buyers from that particular ethnic group and therefore I cannot sell, because the resale market transactions do indicate that buyers from that ethnic group are indeed making resale transactions. We will continue this approach. I think that EIP remains, but we exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis."

Many childcare centres now have available vacancies to enrol children at short notice. However, for few housing estates with high childcare demand, parents may still experience waiting times that range from a few weeks to a few months. In particular, parents may have to wait longer if they prefer a specific centre due to its location or operator or other reasons. A fair proportion of the children in the queues for the more popular centres are already enrolled in some other centres.",

            "Over the past few years, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has been working closely with operators and training agencies on various initiatives to attract, to retain and also to develop our educators. For example, the Polytechnics have increased student intake for early childhood diploma courses by more than 70% last year, from 380 to 675 places. Last October, ECDA launched a comprehensive Early Childhood Manpower Plan to provide more professional development opportunities for early childhood educators, a more supportive working environment, and greater respect and recognition for educators.",
            "To understand and address ground challenges, ECDA conducts very regular consultations with the sector, including townhall sessions, surveys and centre visits. For example, the Early Childhood Manpower Plan was developed in consultation with key sector partners such as unions, industry associations and operators. ECDA will continue to work closely and collaboratively with the sector."

            ": Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have four supplementary questions. The reason I raise this question is because almost every other week, I received feedback from residents requesting for help.",
            "My first question is that, is there any plans to review the salary of teachers? It seems that from the operator, they told me that there is a shortage of teachers. And when I talk to the teachers, they said there is a disparity in the salary between childcare teachers and the school teachers, although they are both degree holders.",
            "The second question, would there be any more new mega child care centres in Yishun, because the one that we have, I understand, is fully subscribed?",
            "The third question is that, will your Ministry work with HDB to have bigger childcare centres for new BTO? Because every new BTO, the childcare capacity is only about 100, which is insufficient.",
            "The last question is that, will the Ministry work with the HDB to have the childcare centre in a new BTO to be in operation when they hand out the keys, because there is always a delay. After a few months, then the childcare centre is in operation."

            ": Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. Perhaps, let me just give a perspective about waiting time for children to be enrolled in childcare centres. We do acknowledge that in certain estates where there is high demand, there is a bit of mismatch, but perhaps just let me give a context as well. For example, in hotspot areas such as Punggol and Sengkang, it ranges from a few weeks to a few months. There are a range of factors that affect waiting time. For example, centre vacancy, demand in estates, parents' preferences for particular centres also matter a great deal, or manpower requirements. We have about 13,800 children currently registered on the wait list, requesting for a childcare place by February 2017. About 40% of them are currently enrolled in a childcare centre but whose parents indicated preference for another centre. And then, the rest are first-timers. But for first-timers themselves as well, some may also be queuing ahead of time and not necessarily having an immediate childcare need.",
            "This is just to provide a context. When we say that there is a waiting list, there is a range of reasons as well. But specifically, we do know that in high-demand areas, there are certain concerns.",
            "One of the areas that the Member had raised is with regard to salary. Salary is one factor in terms of attracting people into the sector. ECDA regularly undertakes manpower surveys to help operators better understand the wage levels and HR practices across the sector. The findings are shared, so that we can encourage operators to keep up with HR practices and to make sure that they remain competitive.",
            "We understand that salaries have shifted upwards, led by the Anchor Operators (AOPs). That is something that we are working on with the AOPs. But it is uneven across the sector. Salaries for entry-level diploma trained teachers are also comparable to other sectors and competitive. We do recognise that salaries do play an important part and we should endeavour to see how best to raise that where possible.",
            "It is not just salaries alone. Beyond salaries, there is also a range of initiatives to recognise and develop the teachers. For example, Skills Framework for Early Childhood Care and Education which spells out the career pathways, specific skills and competencies required for various job roles and therefore encouraging competency-based career development for educators. Also, the Professional Development Programme (PDP) and the ECDA Fellows Scheme which select competent pre-school teachers and exemplary leaders respectively to contribute to the centres or sector and recognise their work through awards and allowances.",
            "There is a range of measures that we are putting in place through the Manpower Plan to try to level up and to make sure that the sector is attractive, so that we can draw more people into the sector.",
            "In terms of some of the other questions, whether there are more mega centres, we are building five large childcare centres in Jurong West, Punggol, Sengkang, Woodlands and Yishun. This was announced last year at COS 2015. This is to provide accessible, affordable and quality childcare services. They will add about 1,900 new places. Each centre can take 300 to 500 children. Four large childcare centres at Punggol, Yishun, Sengkang and Woodlands have started operations. The remaining centre in Jurong West will commence operation in the first quarter of 2017. We are adding four more new large childcare centres announced last month as part of our overall efforts to meet the needs of young families. They will be in Punggol, Sengkang and Bukit Panjang, and they will add about 2,700 new places at these estates and are expected to open by the end of 2018.",
            "We continue to work very closely with stakeholders, as I mentioned earlier, to review the demand and to provide the spaces where possible. Going forward, what we are doing is to work very closely with HDB. We will be revisiting the planning norms to make sure that HDB estates as they emerge, especially with a younger profile, the demand for childcare places can be met by increasing the number of places.",
            "The other question, which is a pertinent one, because I experienced it myself as well, is that when the HDB flat is ready, can the childcare centres be ready at the same time. I recognise that point, I think that is a very fair consideration. That is also something that we are working closely with HDB on, to try to minimise that gap between when the flats and centres are ready. But as Members also realise, for flats, when they are ready, actually the people are streaming in over a fairly long period of time, perhaps up to six months, nine months.",
            "We do recognise that we should try to get it ready as far as possible, so that when the families come in, the childcare centres or the kindergartens can be operational as soon as possible."

            ": Mdm Speaker, the Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a generally mild disease which is endemic in Singapore. Preventive measures are in place to minimise the transmission of HFMD in pre-schools. It is a regulatory requirement for pre-schools to conform to the Ministry of Health's guidelines for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. I would want to repeat that while it is endemic, it is generally a mild disease. Guidelines include conducting daily health and temperature checks upon arrival, ensuring appropriate hand-washing by staff and children, and having an unwell child rest at the designated sick-bay while waiting for the parent or an authorised person to bring the child home.",
            "Centres with two or more suspected or confirmed HFMD cases are required to report the cases to the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and to the Ministry of Health (MOH). Centres are also required to implement enhanced measures to manage the outbreak of HFMD and are encouraged to conduct self-assessment on health and hygiene.",
            "Centres that experience a high number of sustained cases over a period of time may be required to close. We understand that this would cause inconvenience to parents. However, it is a useful step to break the cycle of transmission of the disease. Over the past three years, there have not been more than five centre closures every year. Additionally, there have not been local cases in pre-schools with severe complications due to HFMD.",
            "To support working parents in caring for their young children, the Government has enhanced child and infant care leave provisions over the years. Each working parent with children below the age of seven has six days of childcare leave per year, or a total of 12 days of childcare leave for every couple. Each parent is also entitled to six days of unpaid infant care leave per year during the child's first two years. These childcare and infant care leave provisions are in addition to the parents' annual leave provisions. We also recognise that grandparents and relatives too can play an important role in supporting working parents by providing alternative care for their young children.",
            "Companies too have an important role to play in supporting their employees to manage their work and family responsibilities. The proportion of firms providing ad-hoc flexible work arrangements rose from 70% in 2015 to over three-quarters at 77% in 2016. These firms employ 82% of all employees, and this is up from 76% in 2015. This is an encouraging development and we want to encourage employers to continue on that trend.",
            "Employers who wish to implement flexible work arrangements can tap on various resources such as the WorkPro Work-Life Grant. The tripartite partners also published the Tripartite Advisory on Flexible Work Arrangements to help employers, supervisors and employees implement flexible work arrangements. We want to see this continue to grow.",
            "We urge parents to tap on these flexible work arrangements and enhanced leave provisions to better manage their work and parenthood responsibilities in caring for their children."

I have one clarification which is, in many of the other services industry, you have services such as home care services whereby physiotherapists go to people's home to provide care. Will ECDA be exploring the option of having a list of potential nannies or care-givers who can be deployed to homes in the event that the parents have exhausted their leave or are unable to take leave to be at home with their child? Because many a times, because of work reason or other reasons, they have already exhausted what available resource they have, and having such external resource may be the only other means for them to care for children when they contracted Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease."

            "Apart from taking leave and arranging for flexible work to care for the children, we do encourage parents to explore grandparents, relatives, friends, domestic helpers, fellow parents to pool together efforts to care for the children. We understand the inconvenience affected parents face should a centre close for 10 days, for example. However, we do seek the understanding that this is a necessary step to break the cycle transmission of the disease to other children and other families.",
            "But more directly to your question is whether we plan to provide such services, I think that is beyond the remit of ECDA to do so. Right now, as far as we can see, it is an inconvenience but I think parents, by and large, try to manage where they can. We do urge parents to explore the various possibilities, like one of the key measures we mentioned is for companies to take a much more expansive approach in terms of their flexible work arrangements, and we are encouraged that that will continue to develop.",
            "We also encourage parents to also look at informal arrangements amongst themselves because, obviously, when a particular childcare centre has some of these closure requirements, the parents could also pool efforts between themselves to try to share the responsibilities.",
            "There is a range of different possibilities available but in terms of taking a very specific step for ECDA to provide for such care services, I would suggest that your question with regards to students affected by HFMD, but there are also other illnesses that children contract from time to time, and parents do sometimes face inconvenience. I do not think it is possible for ECDA to provide that service. I guess if there is a very genuine demand, whether there will be companies or others or private sector sort of solutions that will emerge from that, then, that is something that might occur. As of now, as far as we can see, while there are inconveniences, parents try to manage within that range of possibilities that are available to them."

Protectionist barriers to trade would curtail Singapore's ability to tap on demand in export markets or serve as an intermediary for global trade flows. This would have an adverse impact on our economy, of which two-thirds of our GDP is driven by external demand.",
            "On the other hand, our external linkages can also make us more resilient in facing these headwinds. Over the years, we have carefully built up our regional and global connectivity with multiple regions across the world. We have also developed an efficient, stable, pro-business environment, with effective and consistent business and investment frameworks. This allows us to tap on the growth opportunities in Asia and elsewhere, for mutual benefit with like-minded partners. Amidst the current rise of anti-trade sentiments, Singapore will stay the course to remain open and connected, to be an attractive global city that welcomes the best companies, talent and investments.",

With the US' withdrawal, the TPP agreement, as signed, cannot come into effect. This is a setback for the global trade liberalising agenda but need not be the ultimate outcome. Each TPP partner will now have to carefully study the new balance of benefits without the US' participation and consider the value of an agreement among the remaining 11 partners. In addition to consulting with other TPP partners to find a mutually beneficial pathway forward, Singapore is also actively engaged in other regional integration initiatives, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC).",
            "Mdm Speaker, we will also continue to work with like-minded partners at the World Trade Organization (WTO) as advocates of a rules-based multilateral trading system. On the bilateral front, Singapore has an existing network of 21 Free Trade Agreements in force, including with the eight TPP countries and the US. These speak to our deep ties with key trading partners and will help us stay connected as the environment evolves. We will also actively pursue other forms of economic cooperation initiatives, including industrial parks and other projects in the region, to create more opportunities for our companies to collaborate and grow."

The third is, of course, the geo-strategic objective of putting economies across the Pacific and integrate them together. So, I agree with the Member that the TPP was a very ambitious undertaking and it took us nearly six years to cobble it together.

The TPP was negotiated with market access of all the countries but, of course, with the US as a major market for which many countries want additional market access. Now, with that market access no longer available, the set of benefits will change for each country. So, everyone will have to make their new calculations."

            ": Thank you. Over the past few decades, we are observing upward trends in rainfall intensities and frequency of heavy rain events. This, coupled with growing urbanisation which increases stormwater run-off, has made flood management more challenging.",
            "To reduce flood risk, PUB adopts a holistic \"source-pathway-receptor\" approach that addresses flood protection, not just through drains and canals, that is, the pathway; but also in areas generating stormwater run-off, that is, the source; and areas where floods may occur, that is, the receptor.",
            "First, the pathways. Since 2011, PUB has raised drainage design standards for new developments and redevelopments, which would increase their drainage systems' capacity by up to 50%. PUB has also been carrying out improvement works to progressively increase the capacity of existing drains and canals, and rehabilitate older drains. In the last three years, drainage improvement works at 192 locations have been completed and there are on-going projects at 90 other locations.",
            "Given land scarcity, we cannot rely solely on more and bigger drains to mitigate floods. As such, PUB also requires developers to implement \"Source\" solutions to better manage storm-water discharges from developments. These include on-site detention measures for larger developments. In addition, PUB also requires \"Receptor\" solutions, such as higher platform levels, crest protection and flood barriers, especially for critical installations. These help to protect developments when floods occur.",
            "Keeping our drains free flowing is the joint responsibility of all stakeholders − be they public agencies, private developers and contractors, and members of the public. PUB works closely with NEA's Department of Public Cleanliness (DPC) to regularly remove debris, litter and leaves from the drains. It also encourages the public to keep our environment litter-free and give feedback on drain conditions.",
            "In reply to Mr Ang's question, PUB does indeed work with the major development agencies to get their contractors to conduct checks on the public drains near their construction sites to ensure that the drains are free of debris. This is supplemented by PUB's audit checks on approved drainage works on site. During critical stages such as drainage diversion works and decommissioning of existing drains, more frequent checks are carried out. PUB also leverages on technology, for example, CCTVs, to facilitate the monitoring of work sites.",
            "Mr Ang mentioned the recent flash floods, of which one recent occurrence is at Upper Thomson Road. PUB has investigated and found out that it was due to unauthorised works which affected our public drainage system. PUB takes a serious view of such unauthorised works and will not hesitate to take action against errant parties under the Sewerage and Drainage Act. Any person found guilty may be fined up to $50,000 for unauthorised works affecting the public drainage system, and up to $20,000 for unauthorised alteration or interference to the public drainage system. Such penalties and reputational damage, as well as being liable for civil penalties if they cause third-party damage, have been sufficient and effective in the past, and PUB will continue to review the amounts from time to time.",
            "While PUB continues with efforts to reduce flood risks, we should be realistic to note that it is not possible to eliminate floods altogether. Localised conditions, exceptionally heavy downpour, tides and errant behaviour all contribute to flash floods now and then. As such, our focus is also to help members of the public better manage floods when they occur. To this end, PUB has put in place monitoring and alert systems to keep the public updated, through a network of water level sensors and CCTVs. Members of the public can subscribe to receive SMS alerts from selected water level sensors via PUB's website. These sensors are placed in flood prone areas and hotspots and could provide public with early information on the rising water levels in drains in selected flood prone areas.",
            "In the event of a flash flood, PUB works closely with LTA and the Police to monitor road conditions and provide real-time updates on PUB's Facebook and Twitter pages and via radio broadcast, as well as LTA's Expressway Monitoring Advisory System (EMAS) on the roads.",
            "Our stormwater management strategies have served us well. Despite increased urbanisation and more variable weather, flood prone areas have been reduced from 3,200 ha in the 1970s to 30.5 ha today. PUB will continue its efforts to reduce flood prone areas and ensure the proper functioning of the drainage system. However, measures such as drain upgrading, canals and centralised detention tanks take time to implement, and may not be able to cope with all extremities in rainfall.",
            "As such, I urge all parties to play a part in ensuring that our drains are free-flowing, and to appreciate the importance of source and receptor requirements in their developments. Finally, we need to work together to manage floods when they occur, through better and more extensive alerts. Through concerted efforts, we can minimise flood risks and better manage flood events."

With respect to both issues, the needs of the children are very diverse and the label \"ASD\" is insufficient to adequately describe the complexity of the needs that these children may have, from the mild to the moderate to the severe, as well as the co-existence of other challenges, other diseases and other disabilities that the child may have at the same time.",
            "So, there is no fixed planning ratio that you can apply across the whole spectrum of diseases, needs, children and disability profile. The different schools have developed different expertise in particular needs, particular profiles, particular disabilities and particular diseases. They have their own norms to cater to the functional outcomes of executing their curricular plans and serving the needs of their children. This also applies to the manpower planning issue. As we can imagine, the two are very closely related.",

            "I want to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. First off, let me give some context to Higher Chinese language. The Higher Chinese language curriculum was developed at the lower Primary levels to support the needs of our Special Assistance Plan (SAP) Primary schools, of which we have 15 currently. They admit students who are inclined towards learning Chinese at a higher level. Since the higher Chinese language curriculum is available, some other non-SAP Primary schools have also offered it to students with stronger aptitude and interest in the language.",
            "Allow me to reiterate that the two key criteria are strong interest and keen ability in taking up Higher Chinese language. We all know learning language is not just for conversing or writing. It is also culturally-driven. So, it is important that the student has a strong affinity and interest in that subject so that we can nurture the joy of learning in the children and sustain their interest in the Higher Chinese language even after they leave school.",
            "To this end, we are heartened by the enthusiasm that parents and students have shown for the Higher Chinese language. We want to assure the Member and the House that our schools are deeply committed to the teaching and learning of Higher Mother Tongue languages. We do so because it is not just mastering a higher level of Chinese, but also deepening bilingualism which is an integral part of our national identity and cultural heritage.",
            "Another point that I would like to re-assure the Member and the House is that our schools strive to cater to students of different learning capabilities and also home languages, depending on whether they speak English or Mandarin at home. Students are able to take their Mother Tongue at the level that best suits their ability. The Member may ask why is that important. This differentiated approach is very important because it allows the school to customise the level of support for the child's learning. When the learning is pitched at their level and ability, the students can learn the Mother Tongue language to as high a level as they can, and also given adequate opportunities and support. This is important so that we can help to nurture the children's learning of the Mother Tongue and sustain their interest in this language, even beyond school."

We acknowledge St Hilda's Primary School's good intentions in making sure that the students who want to take HCL are well-suited and also are ready to take on the subject because it also entails extra curriculum time and heavier study load for the child. With feedback and guidance from MOE, the school has very quickly reviewed its criteria and will be opening another Higher Chinese language class to cater to the growing desire of HCL.",
            "MOE is very glad that the school is taking positive steps very swiftly to enlarge its pool of HCL students. The broader point is that it really reflects the school's commitment in terms of the teaching and learning of the Mother Tongue language, not just Chinese language but all three Mother Tongue languages. This is why, other than the MOE curriculum, we also have the three Mother Tongue languages promotion committees to supplement the efforts on the ground."

            "A prospective candidate who did not apply for a community certificate in his community declaration must submit: (a) the Community Committee's written notification that his declaration is accepted; as well as (b) a statutory declaration stating that he does not consider himself to belong to the Chinese community, the Malay community or the Indian or Other Minority communities.",
            "Clause 19 amends section 71 to provide that an election can be declared void if the elected candidate made a materially false or misleading statement of fact, or omitted to state a material fact, to the Presidential Elections Committee. This new ground for avoidance is identical to the ground for removing a President in the new Article 22L(3)(e) of the Constitution.",
            "Clause 20 repeals and re-enacts section 73 to further provide that only the Presidential Elections Committee can apply to void an election on the ground stated in the new section 71(f). This is because the false statement, or the omission of the material fact, is made to the Presidential Elections Committee, and so it would be the appropriate party to apply to the Election Judge to void an election.",
            "Let me now address the second category of amendments. These amendments are being made to improve the election procedures. I will go through the key amendments.",
            "The Government is making changes to the design of the ballot paper to improve the process of voting, adjudication and counting.",
            "Clause 8 amends section 23 to stipulate that the ballot paper must have a clearly demarcated area for a voter to mark his vote for a candidate. Clause 10 amends section 25 to state that a voter's mark must only be made in the area demarcated on the ballot paper for that purpose. This ties in with the amendments to section 33 on how ballot papers are to be adjudicated and counted. Clause 14 amends section 33 to require the Returning Officer to only consider the marks made by voters in the area demarcated on ballot papers for voters to mark their votes. Under the amended section, if a voter makes a mark outside of this area, the Returning Officer must disregard that mark when determining whether the voter has given his vote to any candidate. In previous elections, disputes have arisen over whether a mark over a candidate's photo or name should count towards a vote for that individual. The changes will provide clarity in dealing with these situations.",
            "Clause 9 inserts a new section 23A to formalise the inclusion of candidates' photographs on ballot papers and to stipulate the conditions that must be satisfied before a candidate's photograph will be included on that ballot paper. Photographs of the candidates on the ballot paper were first introduced in the 2011 Presidential election. This practice has been welcomed by voters, as they were able to more easily identify the candidate they are voting for on the ballot paper.",
            "The amendment Bill also sets out certain actions to deal with contingency situations pertaining to ballot boxes.",
            "Clause 12 amends section 32A to empower the Returning Officer to extend the time for the sealed ballot boxes from overseas polling stations to reach Singapore. The amendments to that section confer a discretion on the Returning Officer to extend the time by another seven days for the overseas ballot boxes to reach Singapore if two conditions are fulfilled. First, the total number of overseas electors is material to the election outcome. Second, the Returning Officer is satisfied that any of the overseas ballot boxes are not likely to reach Singapore within the initial 10-day period.",
            "Clause 13 repeals and re-enacts section 32B to remove the requirement for a candidate or his counting agent to apply to the Returning Officer for a recount of votes. Currently, the law provides for a candidate or his counting agent to apply for a recount of votes if the criteria for recount is met, that is, if the difference between the number of votes given to the candidate with the most votes and the number of votes given to any other candidate at the election is 2% or less of the total number of votes cast in Singapore, excluding rejected votes and tendered votes, at the election. With the amendment, the Returning Officer must carry out a recount of the votes if the criterion for recount is met. This will avoid unnecessary delays to the recount process.",
            "Clause 15 inserts new sections 36DA and 36DB to deal with the loss or destruction of ballot boxes. If any sealed ballot box containing votes cast at a polling station, whether in Singapore or overseas, is lost or destroyed while it is being transported from a polling station to a counting place, the Returning Officer must, first, abandon the counting of all the votes cast at the affected polling station, and this includes the votes cast at the affected polling station that were not in the lost or destroyed ballot box; and second, re-start the poll for the affected polling station if it will be material to the outcome of the election.",
            "The third category of amendments is being made to the Act to align the Act with certain provisions of the Parliamentary Elections Act relating to election advertising, publication of election survey results and exit polls. Clauses 17 and 18 insert new sections dealing with those issues.",
            "Clause 24 makes consequential amendments to the Parliamentary Elections Act in relation to the registration of overseas electors. The consequential amendments are mainly to section 13A of that Act. The time within which an elector has to register as an overseas elector or apply to change the overseas polling station allotted to the elector is being extended to two days after the writ of election. This will give overseas voters more time to register or change their allotted polling station.",
            "Madam, that covers all the legislative amendments. As I highlighted earlier, I would also like to make two announcements on the Presidential elections. The first is on campaign methods and the second on the date of the Presidential elections. These two areas will not involve amendments to the law or affect this Bill under consideration.",
            "First, the Government will take up the broad thrust of the Constitutional Commission's recommendation on election campaign methods. In its report, the Constitutional Commission stated, and I quote, \"Presidential candidates should be required to conduct their campaigns with rectitude and dignity as befits the office and comports with the unifying role and purpose of the Presidency.\"",
            "The Government fully agrees with the Commission that campaigning for the Presidential election has to be consistent with the President's position as a symbol of national unity. The Government also agrees with the Commission that there should be a difference in the campaign methods for Presidential elections and Parliamentary elections. As the Commission said, a \"Parliamentary election is a contest of ideas and policies, where candidates have to communicate their policies to the electorate and persuade voters as to the strengths of their own proposals as well as the weaknesses of those put forward by other candidates. This clash of ideas and policies makes for a lively but inevitably divisive contest.\"",
            "The Commission also said, and I quote:",
            "(a) \"in contrast, candidates for Presidential elections have no policy agenda to advance\";",
            "(b) \"the President plays no role in setting the national agenda nor does he make policy decisions as to the course that the nation should chart\";",
            "(c) \"[t]hose are matters which properly fall within the remit of the elected Government\";",
            "(d) \"there is little, if any, need for the vigorous contest of ideas that takes place during a Parliamentary election\".",
            "The Commission considered that rules could be enacted which prescribed a \"white list\" of approved campaign methods, such as televised speeches, and explicitly stated that it was not clear if the holding of rallies is either necessary or helpful in dealing with divisiveness.",
            "The Government agrees with the Commission that there should be a clear distinction in campaign methods for Presidential elections and Parliamentary elections. Campaign methods for the Presidential elections must not inflame emotions and must be in keeping with the decorum and dignity of the office of the President, given the important unifying and custodial roles of the President.",
            "The possibility of changes to campaign rules was raised at the end of the debate on the Constitutional Amendment Bill last November. What was clear is that there is support from both sides of this House that campaigning for Singapore's Presidency should be depoliticised and fundamentally different from campaigning during Parliamentary elections. The Government agrees with the Members of this House on our shared goal to differentiate the campaigning methods of the PE from that of the GE.",
            "As Presidential elections are contested on a national level and not on a local constituency level, we will encourage the use of platforms and channels that reach out to voters at a national level. Television enables candidates to have wide national reach, and to broadcast their messages more effectively to the entire nation. At the last PE 2011, there were individual campaign broadcasts and a televised forum. To help candidates reach out to voters, the Government will increase the amount of television airtime for candidates and study different options to achieve this.",
            "Candidates can also use the wide array of social media platforms to reach voters. They can also hold indoor private sessions to engage specific groups of voters. The format of such indoor private sessions is up to the candidates themselves.",
            "The Government will no longer designate any rally sites during Presidential elections. This is in line with the Government's and Constitutional Commission's position not to encourage rallies, which by their nature and format, may be divisive and not congruent with the unifying role of the Elected Presidency.",
            "Nevertheless, candidates who wish to hold rallies may still do so. They will have to apply to Police for a permit. Police will assess the application based on public order and security considerations. As there will not be any designated and pre-security assessed rally sites, Police may require slightly more time to evaluate applications to hold rallies. Even though this can be announced closer to the start of the application process, the Government is announcing it early for transparency and prospective candidates' early awareness.",

Given the slightly longer time required for the new process and to avoid holding Presidential election campaigns during the National Day celebrations period, we will adjust the timing of the polls for the forthcoming elections.",
            "The Government will issue the writ for the election later in August, before President Tony Tan's term expires on 31 August 2017 so that if the election is contested, polling day will take place in September instead of August. This resets the clock, so that, in future, Presidential elections campaigning will take place outside of the National Day period, assuming Presidents serve their full six-year terms.",

If a new President is not elected by the time President Tony Tan's term expires on 31 August 2017, Article 22N of the Constitution provides for an acting President until a new President is elected and assumes office. The Constitution provides for the Chairman of the Council of Presidential Advisers or, if he is unavailable, the Speaker, to be the acting President. The acting President, it should be made clear, cannot exercise the functions of the President under Article 22N indefinitely. We have sought AGC's advice on this proposal to adjust the timing of the polls for the Presidential elections this year. AGC has confirmed that this can be done under the current laws.",

We cannot extend President Tan's term beyond six years unless we amend the Constitution.",

            "I am pleased that society as a whole understands the objectives and rationale behind the proposed amendments.",
            "We want to maintain and protect our multi-racial society because this is what makes Singapore unique. We want to preserve meritocracy because it is a crucial concept to Singapore.",
            "Singapore is a country where anyone can fulfil their potential due to their own hard work and abilities, and not because of their ancestry, their connections, their race or their religion.",
            "Therefore, this system that we want to establish will carefully balance two factors − meritocracy and multi-racialism. The same high standards will be imposed on all candidates regardless of race.",

It demonstrated that our Chinese community uphold the values of multi-racialism and inclusiveness. These values are very important to Singapore. I would like to thank the Chinese community and the community leaders for playing a critical role in this issue.",
            "It is obviously not easy. Singapore is a young nation and our institutions and systems must be adaptable and flexible according to our needs. We should follow the example of our forefathers and do this for the future generations.",

We are drawing closer to our first reserved elections for our President. The changes to the system have taken more than a year to be discussed and fleshed out since they were first publicly mooted. The time taken, along with the range of people that were consulted in the process, signals the Government's intent in refining the system, and ensuring that the office of President is held by a person with the necessary qualities and experience to exercise the powers and duties of the highest office in the country; that the office of the President continues to reflect the multi-racial nature of Singapore; and that this office continues to be a unifying symbol for all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion.

            ": Mdm Speaker, I speak in support of the Bill. In November last year, following the report of the Constitutional Commission headed by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, we passed landmark amendments to our Constitution in relation to the elected Presidency.",
            "One of the major changes was accepting the Commission's recommendation of the concept of a \"reserve election\" in the event a particular race had not had the chance to hold the office of President after five terms. This was to ensure that all the major communities would be represented in the office of elected President.",
            "While there were differences of opinion on whether or not such a \"reserve\" election was appropriate, almost everyone agreed with the principle that every major community ought to be able to represent the country as President. Indeed, the critics mainly argued that such a system was unnecessary because Singaporeans were unlikely to vote along racial lines and there is no reason to institute such a system.",
            "During my speech on the constitutional amendments, I had supported the concept of the reserve election because I believed it was a self-correcting safety net. If the critics were right that race was irrelevant, and members of each of the races were able to prevail in an open election, then this safety net would never be triggered. On the other hand, if there was no President of a certain community after five terms, then it would be triggered, and hopefully, a person of that community would come forward. In the long run, as Singaporeans get used to having Presidents of different communities, hopefully, race will matter less and minority candidates would start winning open elections, making the reserve election mechanism redundant.",
            "This Bill before Parliament makes the consequential changes to the Presidential Elections Act to implement, among other things, the concept of the reserve election. In my speech, I will focus on these amendments, and given they are unique to Singapore, seek clarification on some of the areas that may be open for interpretation.",
            "This Bill creates a new committee called the \"Community Committee\", a committee that is made up of three sub-committees, with five members from each of the Chinese, Malay and Indian and Other Minority committees. It also creates a Chairman for this Committee. The language used in the proposed section 8E of the Act is that this committee is to be appointed by the Prime Minister on the nomination of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights. For each of the committees, the Presidential Council for Minority Rights is required to consult such community organisations as it sees fit.",
            "This is slightly unusual drafting because the typical constitutional convention is for the President to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, whereas this particular provision requires the Prime Minister to appoint based on the nomination of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights.",
            "One clarification I wish to seek from the Minister is whether this is a decision in which it is intended that the Prime Minister is to exercise discretion, in which case it is expected that the Presidential Council for Minority Rights would put forward more than one nominee for the post as Chairman, from which the Prime Minister will select one, and more than five individuals for each of the five sub-committees from which the Prime Minister will select five. On the other hand, if the intention is to leave this decision to the Presidential Council for Minority Rights, then they may only nominate one person for the position of Chairman, and five for each of the sub-committees, in which case it appears the Prime Minister will have no discretion on this matter.",
            "Next, let me move to a new section 8F which sets out the mechanism by which the race of a candidate is to be determined. The mechanism starts with the candidate self-declaring the community to which he considers himself to be a member. The appropriate sub-committee then decides if it agrees with the declaration. Thereafter, there is also a mechanism permitting the Committee to ask the candidate to re-apply if it is of a different opinion.",
            "Naturally, the mechanism is left flexible to deal with the complexity of race. It is part ethnicity and part identity. Thus, a Chinese person adopted at infancy by an Indian family may grow up identifying themselves as part of the Indian community, despite their ethnicity − indeed, inter-racial adoptions were common, particularly during the baby boom years when parents were unable to take care for all their children.",
            "Another issue is people of mixed descent. People of mixed descent may face more challenges and as inter-racial marriages get more common. Indeed, I understand the number has doubled from the last decade. This may become a more controversial issue. Would it be possible, for example, for a person of mixed heritage, say Indian-Malay, to believe they belong to more than one community? Indeed, this would be the aspiration from the perspective of racial integration and permitting dual-ethnicities is logical if the person is able to identify with both communities and is accepted by both communities, but this may mean that dual-identities may then need to be recorded.",
            "Now, the Bill, as currently drafted, permits a person to identify with only one community but a person who identifies with more than one community may then have to make a decision and would this person then be able to change decision if, say, the reserve election were for different community in a subsequent term. Now, this is a problem that, perhaps, may not be faced in the immediate future because we have several terms I think before the next reserve election. But it is one that I think we should prepare for.",
            "The reserve election for Indians and Other Minority communities, in particular, may create issues in this regard. There is a common belief that this category includes everyone who does not fit into the other categories. Thus, everyone of mixed descent might feel they belong in this category based on ethnicity, whether or not they identify with a particular community.",
            "However, I understand the original legislative intent when this category was created for the purposes of the Group Representative Constituencies, was for this category to be based around minority communities that were established in Singapore and not based purely on ethnicity. This appears to be the intention of this Bill as well since section 8F(2)(d) allows the person to declare he does not identify with any of the communities above. Thus, I believe the category \"Other Minority\" communities refers to a community that is established in Singapore.",
            "This would also mean, for example, we have, say, a foreign CEO from a country with no community here who gets Singapore citizenship subsequently and decides he wants to apply, he would not qualify as a member of the \"Other Minority\" communities' category for purposes of a reserve election, but would still be able to apply in an open election under section 8F(2)(d). I think this is fair because the purpose of this reserve election is to ensure that all of our main communities feel represented in the highest office and if a person is not part of a particular community, then they should contest in the open election.",
            "What this means is that the definition of \"Other Minority\" communities is potentially a prickly matter. What would be the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a particular community is one of the \"Other Minority\" communities for purposes of section 8F(2)(c) of the amendment.",
            "I would, therefore, be grateful for the Minister's clarification that the definition of \"Other Minority\" communities as a provision is not intended to be a \"catch-all\" for people who do not fit into other categories by ethnicity, but is intended to be only for those who are part of the established minority communities in Singapore. If the Minister is also able to identify, of course, without limiting which groups may fall into the category of such communities at this point in time, that may also be helpful guidance as to what considerations need to be taken into account in determining whether a person is part of one of the \"Other Minority\" communities.",
            "Mdm Speaker, I am just concluding my section in English. Race is never a pleasant topic because we all like to believe that we live in a place where race does not matter. However, minorities experience disadvantages all the time and it is heartening to know that active steps are being taken to ensure minority representation is possible at all levels, including the office of President. It is my hope that we will one day reach a stage when a member of any race can contest and win the Presidential election without the need for a reserve election, but until we get there, this is a helpful way to ensure that members of each community get a chance to prove themselves in the highest office and help us move towards that ideal.

Tamil is one of the four official languages, and Singapore is one of the few places where Tamil can be used in Parliament. In Parliament, the GRC system has ensured that Malays, Indians and other minority groups have always had a place and a position to speak out.",

We have canvassed our arguments during the debate on the Constitution amendments and we do not intend to rehash them today.",
            "Let me move specifically to two aspects of this Bill which are very problematic. First, how to count reserve elections and, secondly, the eligibility criteria of candidates from the private sector.",
            "First, how to count reserve elections. Clause 3 introduces a new section 5A that to determine whether an election is reserved under Article 19B of the Constitution, one has to refer to the new Schedule. The Schedule sets out a table showing President Wee Kim Wee as the first President to be counted. Together with the subsequent presidential terms of President Ong Teng Cheong, two terms of President SR Nathan and one term of President Tony Tan, these formed five terms where a non-Malay President was in office. Thus the Government reaches the conclusion that this year's Presidential election will be reserved for Malays.",
            "Madam, this is a conclusion that has left Singaporeans bewildered and suspicious. To recap, during the November debate, the Prime Minister told the House for the first time that the Government had received advice from the Attorney-General's Chambers on how to apply the hiatus-triggered mechanism for reserved elections, that is, which President's term to count from. We were told that the advice was that counting should begin from President Wee Kim Wee who was the first President to exercise the powers of an Elected President. This advice was surprising and illogical to many Singaporeans, given that President Wee Kim Wee was never elected to office. When I asked Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean then whether the Government would publish the AGC's advice for Singaporeans to better understand the reasoning, the Government appeared reluctant to do so and even asked me whether I was suggesting that the Prime Minister was not being truthful.",
            "There has been a lot of public reaction to the announcement that this year's Presidential election would be reserved for Malay candidates. After the last Presidential elections six years ago, Singaporeans are right to be sceptical about the Government's motives now. In 2011, Dr Tony Tan was the Singapore's preferred choice but had to fight off three other candidates, scrapping through to victory with a mere 35.2% of the popular vote and a razor-thin margin of 0.35%. For the next Presidential election, we hear a sudden announcement by the Government that it would be reserved for Malay candidates based on reasoning which is totally unconvincing. How many people really believe that the Presidential election this year is reserved for Malays to ensure minority representation and why now?",
            "Madam, three months have passed since that debate. I have been reflecting on the decision to use President Wee as a reference point. I realise that this decision to count from President Wee was not a matter of getting legal advice to interpret any existing laws. If one looks at this Bill and the Schedule, the Government is asking Parliament to simply make it the law that President Wee is the first one to be counted. Why not count from the first Elected President, Mr Ong Teng Cheong? Is it because if President Ong was the first one to be counted, we would have to go through this year's elections as an open election and risk the contest by Chinese or Indian candidates who may not be to the Government's liking? Is the decision to count from President Wee not an arbitrary and deliberate decision of the Government to achieve desired outcome?",
            "Next, eligibility criteria for private sector candidates. Clause 3 also introduces a new section 5C which deals with the eligibility criteria for Presidential candidates from the private sector. Section 5C touches on the definitions of shareholders' equity, profit after tax and insolvency events. These definitions are needed due to the new requirement for candidates to have run companies of shareholders' equity of at least $500 million which have been profitable. But what does section 5C provide? Basically, nothing but to say that Parliament is delegating its legislative authority to the Minister to make regulations.",
            "Madam, as a general principle, Parliament can delegate its legislative power to a Minister to make rules, and regularly does so for matters of a technical or more operational nature. But what disturbs me is that these definitions are not just technical or operational. These definitions would determine who gets to run for President. More importantly, if one refers back to the constitution amendment Bill passed in November, it was provided in the new Article 19(6) that it is the Legislature that is supposed to specify how the Presidential Elections Committee is to determine the value of shareholders' equity and profit after tax, and it is the Legislature that is supposed to specify what constitutes an insolvency event. Since the Constitution entrusts these specific matters to the Legislature to deal with, it is not right for Parliament to simply delegate this responsibility to the Minister to do so. Parliament should not abdicate its responsibility and give a blank cheque to the Government to draw up these definitions.",
            "Madam, as I mentioned at the start of my speech, the Workers' Party opposes the Bill. We will later call for our dissent to be specifically recorded."

            "Mdm Speaker, the President is the symbol of our country and has to unite all Singaporeans regardless of race, language or religion, working together for the country's prosperity and progress. I have three suggestions with regard to the amendments to the Presidential Elections Bill.",
            "First, regarding the neutrality and the fairness of the selection process. New conditions have been included in the eligibility criteria. Including the ethnic Chinese, all candidates need to submit a community declaration to a 16-member Community Committee, and they can only be considered eligible for an election after their ethnicity has been confirmed. The 16 individuals are the so-called inspectors during the election process. Hence, the selection of the committee members should be done with great care.",
            "Notwithstanding their ethnicity, these 16 individuals must be equipped with fundamental qualities such as values, character, capabilities and, especially, good standing in their particular ethnic community. Ideally, they should not belong to any political party; some should have served a long time in community organisations or business chambers. They should be familiar with social matters and have opportunities to interact with people from various backgrounds and have a wealth of experience in community engagement. They should belong to different age groups and should have young people among them. New media is now predominant, and the presentation and the rules of the game vary greatly between the real world and the virtual world. To include in the Committee young people with stable values, who are conversant with internet technology and have an interest in social issues, will enable their views to wield more influence in every sector of society and in the new media. As for the other criteria for members of the Committee, I hope PMO will consolidate the feedback from the community at large before deciding on a complete set of criteria.",
            "Second, inter-racial marriages. Singapore is a multi-racial society. Inter-racial marriages and bringing in new immigrants will bring about ethnic integration. This is a good thing. Winning the respect of the community depends on one's character and behaviour. If there is an outstanding individual who has superlative abilities and is willing to serve the society, even if his/her parents are of different ethnic groups, surely both communities will be proud of him/her. Likewise, if a person has reprehensible character and conduct, no group will find him acceptable. We have to pay attention to the selection process of the Presidential candidates. Besides ethnicity, character and capability are even more important. Thus, should there be any candidates originating from inter-racial background participating in the next presidential election, I hope the Committee could give careful considerations when confirming the community that they belong to, to avoid losing talents.",
            "The third suggestion is to extend the nomination and campaign period. From our first elected President Mr Wee Kim Wee onwards, none of our five Presidents was a Malay. Hence, the next Presidential election will be reserved for Malay candidates. Being a Chinese, I am not familiar with developments within the Malay community and there are many Chinese voters like myself. During the last Presidential election, I took a taxi to the airport. On the way, the taxi-driver said something which has left a deep impression on me. He said, \"The President has to represent Singapore to meet leaders of different countries and his photograph will be hanging on the wall for five years. His wife's photograph will also be displayed for five years. Thus, we cannot make a hasty decision. We must elect someone who is pleasing to the eye.\" While this may sound simplistic, it does reflect the views of the general public towards the Presidential election.",
            "Presidential elections and Parliamentary elections are very different. Many of the candidates who run for General Elections have served in the grassroots for a long time and have had direct interactions with the voters. Some newer candidates have also been mentored by senior MPs and have all-rounded understanding of the roles, responsibilities and the working process. The number of MPs are large and they are from diverse backgrounds as well, enabling them to get the support from voters of different backgrounds.",
            "However, there is only one President. Moreover, for the coming election, the candidates can only be a Malay. If the election period is short, many may not be interested in the election because they are not familiar with the background of the candidates. Whether the President can command the respect and admiration of all Singaporeans, and whether he can unite Singaporeans to forge a better tomorrow, could be a question mark. Hence, I suggest that due to the unique nature of the next Presidential election, the nomination and election period should be extended, allowing more people to understand the background of the candidates. I believe that gold will always shine and talent will always obtain trust. However, as the issue pertains to the population at large, they do need time to understand the candidates.",
            "Mdm Speaker, with regard to the Elected President system, the SCCCI, the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry have arrived at a consensus. We feel that meritocracy and multi-racialism are the two pillars of Singapore's success. Singapore's style of government has been tried and tested over the years. The business community is most concerned about social stability and racial harmony; only then can economic growth be ensured. Hence, I support the amendment to the Presidential Elections Bill and hope that it can be refined continuously."

            ": Mdm Speaker, the Workers' Party opposes this Bill. The Workers' Party believes that Singapore is best served by an appointed President and a system that will allow the Government to appoint a President regardless of race or religion.",
            "One of the most significant aspects of this Bill is the establishment of a Community Committee which ensures that in a reserved election, only persons who see themselves as belonging to a particular community for which the election is reserved, qualify to stand for the Presidential election.",
            "As the Presidential Elections Committee, and by the extension, the Community Committee's decisions are not justiciable in a court of law, Parliament is effectively the last place for Singaporeans to gain an insight to how the Community Committee and sub-committees will operate in practice. How decisions are made these Committees in reserved elections, will be the focus of my speech.",
            "Clause 8(g) is scant on details as to how the relevant Community Committee/sub-committees will assess a potential candidate as to whether he or she is a member of a particular minority community. With the prospect of reserved elections for minorities, it should be reasonable to assume that the Government expects form to follow function. It cannot be the Government's intention that a bare declaration that a candidate considers himself or herself to be part of a particular community as stated in clause 8(f) would carry overwhelming weight for candidature to the highest office in the land.",
            "To this end, clause 8(g)(4) states that the Committee must be guided by the merits of the application by a prospective Presidential candidate. But what defines a meritorious application and what basis will an application be deemed so? What factors are assessed to determine if an applicant sees himself or herself as a member of particular community?",
            "To begin with, and in step with the Government's decision to institute reserved elections, the Government must concede that language is an important criterion that is intricately tied to race. To that end, does a minority applicant's language abilities in his or her Mother Tongue matter to the relevant Committees/sub-committees the same way it does for Singaporean students through their educational journey? Would an applicant be expected to have passed his or her Mother Tongue at the GCE \"O\" and \"A\" levels? For example, should a Presidential candidate who sees himself as part of the Indian community pass muster if he or she can barely get on by in Tamil or the other MOE-recognised Indian languages? Can the Minister confirm if language proficiency is a consideration of the Community Committee and if it is not, why not?",
            "Secondly, the President's spouse is for all intents and purposes, a customary but central part of the Presidency, reflected most vividly with the portraits of both President and First Lady prominently displayed in all Government buildings. Former Speaker of Parliament, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi put it differently when he told The Straits Times about his possible candidacy in the upcoming reserved Presidential elections, and I quote, \"I will be lying if I say that friends have not been asking me about it… If you look at the people who qualify, it is not that big a pool… I have got to think of my own preferences, my life, my family and my privacy. This is not a journey I take myself.\" The last point is worth repeating and it needs to be stressed − this is not a journey I take myself.",
            "On that note, has the Government deliberated whether the background of an aspiring President's spouse is a factor for the Community Committee's consideration in assessing whether that applicant is a member of a particular community? For example, in the case of an inter-racial marriage, what if the spouse of the applicant does not see himself or herself to be part of the Indian community whereas the aspiring Presidential candidate does? What if a spouse has converted to Islam in order to marry but does not partake in the practices of the faith?",
            "Mdm Speaker, these questions are central to the symbolic role of the President as a unifier of the country and even more so after the Government has determined that some Presidential elections ought to be reserved for specific races. Should there be residual doubts about how the Community Committee makes its decisions, the presidency could be anything but a unifying office not just for Singaporeans in general but the respective minority race in particular.",
            "A third aspect of the Community Committee I wish to clarify with the Minister is whether the Community Committee would expect an applicant to be active in community work and what this entails. This expectation has also been referred to by one academic who was quoted in the media as saying that if an applicant has not been, and I quote, \"in the public eye, and he is not actively in community work, it is much harder to make the case for seeking election to the highest office of the land.\" What are the expectations of community service amongst the candidates and if so, are the expectations the same with regard to all four classes of candidates, namely, public sector, public sector deliberative track, private sector and the private sector deliberative track?",
            "Fourthly, during the recent debate on the Constitution, one PAP Member of Parliament suggested that the presidency ought to be reserved for individuals born in Singapore. The Government did not address this point during the debate but perhaps it can today. Can the Government at least affirm that the Presidential Elections Committee shall not issue a certificate of eligibility to any male candidate who has not performed two years of national service? This would be in line with the reality that national service brings Singaporeans of all races together towards a common purpose and would serve as an important foundation for the life experience of any future President.",
            "Fifthly, Mdm Speaker, I take the position that because minority candidates are likely to be few to begin with, many candidates are likely to enter Presidential elections through the public sector track or public sector deliberative tracks rather than the more stringent private sector track with its $500 million threshold. This may render hollow the Government's claims that it is not relaxing the criteria to make it easier for minorities to assume the presidency as a result of the latest constitutional changes. If so, the more accurate statement would be that the stringent private sector requirements simply do not apply for public sector track or public sector deliberative track candidates, minority or otherwise. What this point does reiterate however, is the importance of the Government sharing what criteria would be used by the PEC to determine if a public sector deliberative track minority candidate qualified for candidature as President in the first place.",
            "Finally, the idea of race poses other considerations in certain cases of reserved elections involving public sector track or public sector deliberative track candidates. For example, in the case of Mdm Speaker, should the hon Speaker decide to stand as a candidate, what happens to the very existence of Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC which, by law, requires a Malay Member of Parliament as one of its political representatives in Parliament? Should it be passed, does this Bill herald a new precedent in marked contrast to the scenario in Jurong GRC some years ago when the late PAP Member of Parliament Mr Ong Chit Chung passed on?",
            "Does the Bill and the prospect of reserved Presidential elections change the Government's thinking on the question − Will a by-election be called in a GRC when the minority member of a GRC steps down to contest in a Presidential election? Can the Government set out its position on this matter in light of the introduction of reserved Presidential elections."

This Bill proposes to put in place nuts and bolts to give effect to these changes and to improve election procedures. Today, I ask about election procedures.",
            "Clause 15 of the Bill proposes to abandon the counting of ballots cast at a polling station if one of the ballot boxes is lost or destroyed in transit from the polling station to a counting centre, and to restart the polling, if necessary. In this connection, I would like the Minister to confirm if the smallest of unit to which electors are allotted in our Presidential Election is the ballot box, a unit smaller than the polling stations? If so, I would like to make the following points on election procedures.",
            "On the abandonment of counting, the Bill provides that in the event a ballot box is lost or destroyed in transit, the counting of all the votes cast at the affected polling station, including the votes cast that were not in the lost or destroyed ballot box, would be abandoned. The voting for the affected polling station would be restarted if the difference in the vote count of the two leading Presidential candidates, without counting the votes cast at the affected polling station, is less than the sum of:",
            "(a) the total number of electors allotted to the affected polling station and entitled to vote in the election; and",
            "(b) the total number of overseas electors entitled to vote in the election.",
            "If electors are allotted to the level of ballot boxes, should we not provide that any re-vote would take place only if the total number of electors affected by the lost or destroyed ballot box, rather than the entire polling station, proved material? In other words, why not limit as much as we can the electoral impact of any lost or destroyed ballot boxes?",
            "In the last Presidential Elections of 2011, the difference between the ballots cast for President Tony Tan and Dr Tan Cheng Bock was just some 7,000 votes. It is not unreasonable to expect that fewer than 4,000 electors allotted to an affected polling station and another 4,000 electors registered to vote overseas, would trigger a re-vote at the polling station in a close election under the proposed amendments. Why give leverage to persons who tamper with the ballot boxes seeking to influence the results of our Presidential Elections? Why amplify their powers to do so in close elections?",
            "The restart of polling. How about the manner in which the polling would be restarted once it has been determined that the affected number of votes is material? Currently, in a different context, our laws provide that polling may be abandoned and restarted on another day in our Presidential or Parliamentary Elections in the case of riot or open violence, storm, flood, fire, fire, health hazard or some other difficulties in the physical conduct of voting. In such cases, our laws provide that the abandonment and the restart of polling must be carried out in the prescribed manner and, among other things, only those electors who \"have not already voted\", shall be entitled to vote when the polling restarts. In contrast, in the Bill before us today, it is not clear to me if electors who have voted at the polling station and whose ballots remain available for counting because they are not in the lost or destroyed ballot box, whether they would also vote again when polling restarts in this case?",
            "Instead, the Bill says, \"The Minister may prescribe the manner in which the abandonment of the counting of votes, the restart of polling, or the counting of votes is to be carried out\". Does this mean the Minister would have the discretion to decide whether all electors allotted to the affected polling station would vote again upon the restart of polls, or limit the re-vote to only the electors allotted to the lost or destroyed ballot box? And if the Minister indeed has that discretion, is that not too much discretion, especially in a close election?"

Regardless of any view on this matter, we cannot deny that the discussions that we had together as one people have sparked an awareness about the important things in our lives within a multi-racial society. We have not reached the ideal state where everything is perfect and the efforts to forge inter-racial relations is a work-in-progress, especially in the context of an ever-changing world. We can see the challenges in other countries, and we need to prepare our people to overcome those challenges.",

Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), he asked that Singaporeans, as a society, remain committed in protecting our minorities. He also spoke about how minorities should also play their part and not become exclusive. This view is stated in the context of discussing the issue of xenophobia and extremist views.",

After a very intensive debate during that Reading, the Bill was passed, and we are already now looking at the specific amendments to the Presidential Elections (Amendment) Bill.",

I would like to seek a clarification on whether there will be an opportunity for an applicant to present further facts to the Community Committee or the sub-committee in the event the applicant's application for community certificate is rejected? In particular, clause 8H(9) appears to suggest that the applicant may not make another community declaration upon rejection except on the invitation of the Community Committee. Can the applicant request for a further invitation?",
            "Secondly, I would like to recap the findings and proposals made by the Constitutional Commission on the rules governing election campaigns for the Presidency. The Commission had among other things proposed that there be rules to regulate campaigning methods, with a view to tempering divisiveness of the election process and ensuring that campaigning remains consistent with the role of the President as a symbol of national unity and which preserves the dignity associated with the highest office of the land.",
            "The Commission had also proposed that certain laws be enacted for candidates to make explicit declaration on their understanding of the constitutional role of the President, make it an offence for candidates to make promises or take positions that are incompatible with the office of President and impose a regime of sanctions. I see merit in the proposals made by the Commission to avoid divisive campaigning and giving misinformation about the President's role to the public. I therefore welcome and am happy to note the amendments that clause 6, with regard to the statutory declarations required of the candidate, and clause 17 on election advertising. I am also happy to hear that there will be some adjustments made to allow for more national airtime for the Presidential candidate. These are useful measures in the right direction to regulate campaign conduct.",
            "In conclusion, I wish to highlight that in the course of our discussions on the Elected Presidency, there was an awareness that we could do better in maintaining our race relations in Singapore. We are not race-blind, we are not there yet. The discussion on minority representation for the Elected Presidency system has created an openness to talk about something that used to be perceived as a sensitive topic, such as race. It made us a bit uncomfortable to think about the current state of affairs but it had pushed us to think about issues a bit more.",
            "What is heartening for me is that at the core of the discussions, is a great desire to see Singapore embrace its multi-racial, multi-cultural and multi-religious identity. There was a firm acknowledgment of our commitment to make Singapore a place for all races, and I think this is worth reflecting on and would be a galvanising force to rally people to decide on what is best for Singapore.",

When I was in London late last year, I had the opportunity to have dinner with some Members of Parliament of the United Kingdom from both the Labour and Conservative parties. Some of them were ex-Ministers. Some have been Members of Parliaments for decades. We discussed several issues, including why the majority of UK EU Referendum's opinion polls were wrong. Many reasons were cited, including the following: (a) opinion polls predicted that the majority of the UK residents would vote against Brexit to stay in the EU. But these results were skewed as a significant group of the Brexit camp did not voice their true opinions in the surveys. They did not want to be perceived as being anti-EU when the main stream media and experts were saying otherwise; (b) this lulled the \"Remain\" camp into a state of complacency and many chose not to vote, thinking it would be a safe result.",

History repeated itself when the majority of the opinion polls in the United States had predicted a win for Mrs Hillary Clinton but Mr Trump won surprisingly and convincingly.",
            "These are the reasons why I support the insertion of sections 60B and 60C under clause 18 to ban election surveys and exit polls for the period between the issuance of writ of election and the close of all the polling stations on the polling day of the election. Election surveys are exciting, newsworthy and lucrative to the companies that conduct the survey but may not be helpful. In fact, it may be harmful. However, the British Members of Parliament disagreed with me. The British and Americans are so used to election surveys that it would be hard to ban them.",
            "For Singapore, it is best not to start having elections surveys. This is a uniquely Singapore phenomenon, and so is the reserved election.",

            "I would like to clarify with the Minister: which aspects of the President's role would be stated in the prescribed form, which the candidate is expected to understand. When would the prescribed form be released to the public? Why is there a need for an additional requirement? What would be the consequences if a Presidential candidate, during his or her campaign, says things or makes election promises that contravene certain aspects of the President's role under the Constitution? Would the candidate be disqualified during the campaign or after the campaign when the candidate has already won the election? Or would the candidate be able to get away with a fine only after the polling day?",
            "For that matter, I have wanted to ask what would be the changes to the election rules that govern the Presidential Election prior to the Minister's speech during the Second Reading. I am glad that the Minister has made two announcements regarding the Presidential Election, especially the election rules. It is a worthy move that makes it more transparent, upfront and give all stakeholders ample time to clarify, adapt and comply.",

The Presidential candidates need to reach as many Singaporeans as possible within a short period of time, and the best channel is through TV broadcast. Just as I was pondering on asking the Minister when the new election regulations will be announced, Minister Chan revealed them at the Second Reading. It came unexpectedly. However, I am glad that he has made the announcement early to make it more transparent and fair. It also allows potential candidates to have ample time to prepare.",
            "I noted that the Minister did not specify the frequency of the TV broadcast. Since TV broadcast will be the main channel by which the candidates can reach the voters, the TV broadcast frequency should at least double as compared to the last Presidential Election. At the same time, there should be at least two live telecast debates between the candidates so as to give Singaporeans enough opportunities to assess the candidates' capabilities and persuasiveness. I hope the Minister can consider this suggestion.",
            "In today's digital age, the candidates can always go online and use various social media to reach the voters. Although TV broadcast and online communications allow the candidates to engage the voters extensively, many Singaporeans would still prefer to see the candidates in person. Certainly, the candidates could go to shopping malls or hawker centres during peak hours to meet and talk to Singaporeans. However, there remain space and environmental constraints. I would like to ask the Minister, under the new regulations, whether the candidates can apply to hold rallies at large sites, such as the Singapore Indoor Stadium, to have face-to-face dialogues with the people. If that is permissible, I hope that the Police can simplify the application procedures.",
            "I understand that it is not possible for the candidates to meet every voter face to face. Nonetheless, I hope that under the new election rules, Presidential candidates could still have the option to access to large sites for the purpose of having live interaction with the masses.",
            "We know that the coming Presidential election will be reserved for Malay community for the first time. If we follow the previous election schedule, the polling day may conflict with the Hajj's period. This will not be very wise. For this reason, I support the proposal to postpone the polling day of the Presidential election.",
            "I also have some questions regarding the functions and responsibilities of the Acting President. When Dr Tony Tan steps down as the President on 31 August 2017, the Chairman of the Council of Presidential Advisers will assume the role of the Acting President, until the new President is elected in mid or end September. Does the Acting President have the same powers as the Elected President? If so, some critics might have conspiracy theories that the Government will, in this interim period, ask the Acting President to approve the use of the reserves or make key appointments such as the Police Commissioner or Chief Justice.",
            "To be sensible, there is no need to rush to access past reserves or to appoint key government officials so hastily. So I hope that the Minister can assure us that the Government will not ask the Acting President to exercise his custodial powers during the September transition period. This is to pre-empt such rumours from surfacing in the first place.",
            "In summary, I support the Bill and I applaud the early announcement on the changes to the election rules of the Presidential Election. However, I hope that the Minister can clarify the purpose of asking the Presidential candidate to declare their understanding of the President's role as stated in the Constitution and the implications of the declaration.",
            "At the same time, I hope that the Minister could ensure that Presidential candidates are not denied the opportunity to meet the masses face to face during the campaign period. Lastly, I would like the Minister to assure Singaporeans that the Government would not exploit the potential weakness of the system during the September period before the next Elected President takes office."

            ": Madam, I stand in support this Bill. However, I would like to seek a few clarifications and also offer some suggestions.",
            "I hope that the decision-making process of the Community Committee can be transparent. I trust that the Community Committee will carry out its functions in a fair and equitable manner. Hence, there should be no issues and difficulties in allowing the decisions and processes to be transparent.",
            "In today's liberal social media where opinions and questions are openly raised and disseminated, it would be advisable for the Government to provide answers and clarity, before doubt and misinformation cloud the minds of people. To this end, the Community Committee should be transparent in its processes.",
            "May I suggest that the Community Committee inform the declarant as to why the Community Committee concluded that the declarant is not a member of the particular Community that he or she declared to be of?",
            "I have as well additional reasons for suggesting why the Community Committee should reveal the reasons that guided it to the conclusion to reject a declaration form.",
            "First, the declarant does not appear to have any recourse if he or she believes the decision made by the Community Committee is incorrect or unjustly concluded. As per section 8J(2), the Community Committee's decision is final and not subject to any appeal or review by the court.",
            "Further, the Community Committee is granted very comprehensive immunity as well, subject to the exception of malice, which is a high threshold to satisfy in a procedural or administrative context.",
            "Secondly, unless invited by the Community Committee, the declarant may submit his or her form only once. Hence, it would be considerate to produce the reasons behind the rejection in order to demonstrate that the Community Committee considered the form and relevant documents or evidence rigorously and fairly in an application where the declarant has probably only one chance.",
            "Thirdly, the Community Committee, which is statutorily unencumbered by legal forms or evidence laws as per section 8G(4), appears to be able to make its decision with fewer considerations or constraints. Hence, it would be helpful for the declarant and the public to know of the reasons behind the rejection. This would surely help preserve the credibility of the Community Committee.",
            "Madam, may I also seek clarifications on section 8L of the Bill. I note that the Community Committee may regulate its own procedure. Could the use of this power be clarified and what possible regulations of procedure do we envisage?",
            "Next, I note that a defect in the appointment of any member of the Community Committee would not invalidate \"any proceedings of the Community Committee\".",
            "The phrase \"any proceedings\" appear to include decisions on accepting or rejecting a declaration form. May I know why a defect in this particular appointment should be tolerated when a strict and stringent approach has always been adopted in election matters?",
            "Madam, ancillary to this Bill is the powers of the Presidential Elections Committee. Like how the Community Committee determines if a person is of a particular community, the PEC functions as another gatekeeper. May I propose that the PEC also reveals its reasons for rejecting any candidate for not being \"a person of integrity, good character and reputation\" as per Article 19(2)(e) of the Constitution? As a group of persons who are not democratically elected by the citizens of Singapore, it is only appropriate for the PEC to account to the electorate on the reasons that guided the PEC to limiting the nominees to such persons only.",
            "Madam, I believe that the declarant ought to know the reasons behind being rejected by the Community Committee in a system where he or she probably only has one chance and where the decision is final and not subject to any appeal or judicial review. Madam, the above comments notwithstanding, I stand in support of the Bill."

          "speaker": "Mr Chan Chun Sing",
          "content": [
            ":Madam, first, I would like to thank all the Members for speaking up on this Bill. As I emphasised at the start of my speech, this Bill makes amendments to the Presidential Elections Act that operationalise the changes that were made to the Constitution in November last year. The principles underlying the changes were passed by the House last year, and the debate on those changes have passed. This is not the place to re-ignite those debate. And I hope that the debate would take place on the changes in the Bill today.",
            "With that, let me deal with the specific matters raised by the Members. These can be grouped into two broad sets of issues. The first set of issues relates to the Community Committee provisions. The second set of issues relate to the election processes. If I have time, I will cover some of the queries on the campaigning method and the timing of the election.",
            "Let me begin with the first set of issues: the Community Committee. First, let me thank Ms Rahayu Mahzam for making the points that it is important for us to make efforts to maintain our multi-racial and multi-cultural identity, and that we need to always take care of the rights of minorities. We will continue to work hard to ensure that each Singaporean feels cherished in our society, regardless of which community they are from.",
            "Ms Rahayu also had a question on whether an applicant can request for a further invitation to submit a community declaration upon rejection. As the proposed new section 8H(9) points out, the invitation comes from the Community Committee and is unsolicited. An applicant cannot request for an invitation.",
            "I also thank Mr Thomas Chua for raising two points in his speech relating to the Community Committee.",
            "First, the Government agrees that the Community Committee has to be diverse and each sub-committee has to be representative of the community it represents. The five members who belong to the Chinese community are to be appointed by the Prime Minister on the nomination of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights after consulting such organisations of the Chinese community as the Council sees fit. This will ensure that the views of the Chinese community will be taken into account in the nomination process.",
            "Second, the Government also agrees with Mr Chua that qualified persons must not face difficulties with applications for community certificates simply because they are of mixed parentage. If a citizen whose parents belong to two different communities decides to run and decides to apply for a community certificate, the relevant community sub-committee should adopt an inclusive attitude toward his application.",
            "I would also like to thank Mr Louis Ng for the two suggestions he made in his speech. First, I agree with Mr Ng that the process should be as transparent as possible. All these are set out in regulations. We are amending this Bill first before setting out the necessary regulations governing how the Presidential Elections Committee and the Community Committee will conduct their meetings. The regulations will also set out the process for applying for the certificates and the information to be furnished by the prospective candidates.",
            "However, we will not be making the Community Committee release grounds as to why it decides to accept or not accept the community declaration of a prospective candidate. The Constitutional Commission suggested that we adapt the mechanism for determining a prospective candidate's community from the Parliamentary Election Act, and the mechanism in the Parliamentary Elections Act does not require the Community Committee to release grounds. This has worked well over the years and we see no need to disturb this.",
            "Second, Mr Ng suggested that the PEC should set out its reasons for rejecting a candidate. Indeed, the Constitutional Commission said that \"it would be desirable for the PEC to give reasons when it rejects applications for Certificates of Eligibility\", as this will \"provide a measure of transparency and accountability to the process.\"",
            "However, the Commission did not think that the PEC should publicise its reasons for rejecting an application, because that could discourage persons from stepping forward to run for office, for fear of the embarrassment of being rejected in their application for a Certificate of Eligibility and then having the reasons for the rejection made public. The Commission suggested that \"a more measured solution would be to require the PEC to furnish to the unsuccessful applicant its reasons for denying the Certificate of Eligibility, and to leave the applicant to decide for himself or herself whether he or she wishes to make those reasons public.\" The Government broadly agreed with this suggestion in the White Paper; the PEC should set out its grounds when it rejects a prospective candidate's application, but not publicise it. As this is governed by subsidiary legislation, we will proceed to amend the relevant regulations after this Bill is passed.",
            "Mr Vikram Nair made two points in his speech. First, he asked about the Prime Minister's appointment of the members of the Community Committee upon the nomination of the PCMR. The intention under the new section 8E is for the PCMR to nominate one person for the position of Chairman and five for each of the sub-committees, and the Prime Minister will appoint them to the Community Committee accordingly.",
            "This mirrors the approach taken with regard to the nomination of the Chairman and Members of the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee by the PCMR and their appointment by the President, as set out in the Parliamentary Elections Act.",
            "Second, Mr Vikram Nair sought a clarification that the \"other minority communities\" provision is not intended to be a catch-all for people who do not fit into other categories by ethnicity, but is intended to be only for those who are part of the established minority communities in Singapore. He also asked about which groups may fall into the category of such communities at this point in time.",
            "Deputy Prime Minister Teo provided an answer to this in the debates on the Constitutional Amendments last November. He made clear then that the \"other minority communities\" refer to groups that have some degree of history, permanence and established presence in Singapore, such as the Eurasian community.",
            "Ms Sylvia Lim made two points. First, she asked, as she did last November during the debate on the changes to the Constitution, about the advice from the Attorney-General's Chambers to the Government on the counting of terms. At the same debate, Deputy Prime Minister Teo had confirmed to Ms Lim that the advice referred to by the Prime Minister in his speech was, indeed, the Attorney-General's Chambers' advice, and invited Ms Lim to challenge it judicially if she thought that it was not correct advice. Ms Lim then suggested that there might be something controversial or confidential that the Government was unwilling to publish.",
            "The Government is confident of the advice rendered by the Attorney-General. We proceeded on that basis during the debates on the constitutional changes in this House. Prime Minister Lee explained to all why we needed the hiatus-triggered mechanism, and we passed the Constitution (Amendment) Bill. We are here today to put the nuts and bolts in place for a decision made clear by the Prime Minister during the debates in November. And we will not go through this again.",
            "Ms Lim spoke about being bewildered. I have also gone round to solicit feedback from the public. I am rather bewildered that Ms Lim is bewildered, because I did not receive the sentiments that Ms Lim said she got. The feedback that I have received has not been like that. And if I may just make two points.",
            "Ms Lim once again questioned the Attorney-General's advice. I am a bit bewildered by this. I would like to clarify: (a) Is Ms Lim suggesting that the Attorney-General did not give the Government the appropriate advice? Or (b) that the Prime Minister has not been truthful with the Attorney-General's advice? If it is the first, then I think Ms Lim, as suggested by Deputy Prime Minister Teo, can challenge this in the courts. But if it is the second, then I am afraid it is a very serious issue to cast aspersions on the integrity of our Prime Minister. Ms Lim, you are a lawyer; I am not a lawyer. You will know that when you get advice, you do not freely publicise your advice and you may have various reasons why you do not publicise all your advice. And as a lawyer, I think you will know this better than me. So, I think we should not impute motives on this Government or the Prime Minister.",
            "On Ms Lim's second point, the proposed amendments state that the Minister must have regard to, to the extent that they are applicable, the prevailing accounting standards and the general law relating to the insolvency of companies. These are standards set by professionals. The Minister does not have unbridled power. And if you think about it, is this not even better than the Minister setting the rules by himself? We are adhering to the prevailing accounting standards set by the professional bodies and not by someone else outside the profession. So, if you ask me, I think this is an even stronger system than that proposed for the Minister to decide.",
            "To give clarity and certainty, we will provide administrative guidelines to the applicants.",
            "Mr Pritam Singh made several points. First, on language proficiency and other criteria Mr Singh spoke about how it is up to the Community Committee to look at the prospective candidate holistically, and not home in on one factor. This is not new; it has worked well in the GRC context.",
            "Second, as to whether the President has to be born in Singapore, we should be careful in differentiating between new citizens and those who are born in Singapore. All citizens pledge allegiance to Singapore. They are entitled to exercise their rights and are expected to live up to their responsibilities. The question of whether a new citizen is accepted as a unifying symbol of Singapore is one that should be left to the electorate to decide.",
            "Third, constitutionally, there is no such thing as a First Lady position. There is only the President. If I may refer Members to the Hansard, in 2001, then-Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, answered a question by Mr JB Jeyaretnam, had stated that \"The First Lady is not a position enshrined in the Singapore Constitution. It is a courtesy term that has been customarily used for the wife of the President, including previous Presidents, before the Elected Presidency was created.\"",
            "Fourth, Mr Pritam Singh asked about the GRC system. Mdm Speaker, I beg your indulgence. This is totally unrelated to the Bill today but, since it was raised, I will deal with it.",
            "When Mr Goh Chok Tong moved the motion to explain the GRC system to this House, it was done with a very clear intent to achieve two purposes.",
            "One, it was to ensure that this House has sufficient minority Members in the House as a system. Today, we have about one-third of our House with minority Members. That is more than what you would expect proportionally from adding up the percentage of Malays, Indians and Other Minorities. So, that was the first purpose ‒ to make sure that this House has sufficient minority represented. And, over the years, we have achieved this by leaning forward and having more than the minimum that we are expected to have.",
            "The second reason for the GRC system was to make sure that none of the parties will campaign on issues on a race/religion platform, that we will all, regardless of party lines, campaign on the basis that we are all Singaporeans, that we will not use race, language or religion for political reasons.",
            "These were the two very clear reasons why we established the GRC system in this House. The Members of the GRC team who are elected to serve their respective GRCs are expected to serve all their residents, regardless of race, language or religion.",
            "Mr Goh Chok Tong was further asked: if one Member of the GRC team resigns or for whatever medical reason is incapacitated, does the GRC need to hold a by-election? And the answer was given that it is no, because, recalling the two specific reasons that we set up the GRC system: one was to ensure that this House has sufficient minority representation and, given our current circumstances, we have more than what we would expect by a pure proportional representation system; two, the aim was to make sure that no parties campaigned on the issues of race, language or religion; and three, all Members of the GRC team are expected to serve all their residents regardless of race, language and religion.",
            "Madam, I beg your indulgence. This is totally unrelated. But since it was asked, I will put on record our reply. Today, we have 25 minority Members of Parliament out of 89 elected. Even if we have one less, there are 24 out of 89, which is 27% of Parliament.",
            "Fifth, let me talk about public sector candidates which Mr Pritam Singh raised. I do not think the public sector candidates lack experience. Whether it is a public sector candidate or a private sector candidate, they all bring with them their respective suite of experience to the office of the President. They are senior people who have been exposed to a broad range of social, economic and security issues and they would likely have managed and led substantial organisations and regularly made decisions impacting thousands, as the Commission had noted. These officers would have \"experienced the contrary pulls and pressures of Government decision making\".",
            "Before I leave this point about the process, I also want to touch on one point which Ms Sylvia Lim raised. Ms Sylvia Lim, in your speech, you seemed to have suggested or imputed that this Government has all sorts of short-term political objectives to amend the Constitution and put in place this new system. Can I put it to you that this is not the style of this Government? We are here to build for the long haul. We are here to take care of the country for the long haul. We are but stewards entrusted with the responsibility to take Singapore forward.",
            "The changes that we have made are significant ones. We made it not because there is an immediate issue that we have to address, but we made it with a view to make sure that issues like these do not come about, especially sensitive issues on race, language and religion.",
            "As the debate in November had highlighted, we will be very happy to be proven wrong, that one of these days we are totally race-blind as we all aspire to be; just like you and for me. But we are all concerned for the future of this country. What if we are not and what if we are wrong? Then, it is our responsibility to do what we can to build a mechanism that best allows us to overcome these difficulties should they arise. It is not for short-term political advantage. If it is for short-term political advantage, let me ask the Members of this House, if we are politicians here calculating our short-term political advantage, would we expend political capital to do this?",
            "By any measure, any sensible people whom we can talk to, they would know, that such amendments and the moving of this Bill carry with it high political risk, if not political cost. If this Government led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is for short-term political advantage, would we do it? Would we expend our political capital to do this? We have no need to do it now because it not as if we have faced a problem now, but we know the day when we face the problem, we may not have the chance to discuss this calmly as we do now.",
            "So, I would urge Members of this House not to impute, perhaps, our own motives on why we are doing this. We have gone through this in November and I will repeat this again. We are here for the long haul. We are here to build systems for Singapore for the long haul, not for short-term political advantage, not for the political advantage of any particular parties. We are but stewards for our nation.",
            "Let me continue to talk about the election processes.",
            "I would like to thank Mr Ang Wei Neng for supporting the ban on election surveys and exit polls. To Mr Chen Show Mao, the polling station is the lowest unit because voters can drop their ballot papers in any of the ballot boxes in the polling station. This is why even if one box is destroyed and the number of the voters in the polling station is material to the outcome of the election results, we will restart the polls for the affected polling station.",
            "Let me now touch on campaigning methods.",
            "The third set of questions were on the campaign methods for the Presidential Elections. I thank Mr Ang Wei Neng and Ms Rahayu Mahzam for speaking on this issue. Let me speak on the specific points that the Members raised. The Government believes, like the taxi driver in Mr Thomas Chua's story, that electing a President is an important matter and that voters should be informed and not cavalier in exercising their vote. This is why we have amended the Act to make sure that prospective candidates have to state that they are aware of the limits set by the Constitution on the role of the President, and they will have no excuse if they decide to mislead the electorate on the proper role of the President. The voter must vote in an informed fashion.",
            "It would be appropriate here to discuss Mr Ang's question about the statutory declaration that candidates have to make, stating that they understand the role of the Elected President under the Constitution.",
            "The Constitutional Commission cited one observer as saying that it was \"misleading and a great disservice to the electorate\" when previous candidates promised to pursue particular policies if they were elected into office, despite such areas not being within the constitutional remit of the President's functions. Ms Rahayu alluded to the Commission's recommendations to deal with this, and said that she saw merits in the proposals. What specifically did the Commission propose? The Commission proposed that laws be enacted, which:",
            "(a) require candidates to explicitly declare that they understand the constitutional role of the President before they may be issued a Certificate of Eligibility (CoE) in the form of a statutory declaration contained within the application form for the Certificate of Eligibility (CoE);",
            "(b) make it an offence for candidates to make promises or to take positions that are incompatible with the office of President; and",
            "(c) impose a regime of sanctions where a breach of election rules, including a breach of the prohibition in (b), could give rise to a range of possible consequences including criminal sanctions, applications to an Election Judge for declaratory reliefs, and, in appropriate extreme cases, the revocation of a candidate's Certificate of Eligibility (CoE).",
            "Although the Commission suggested criminal sanctions, the Government has decided to take up the first proposal of requiring the statutory declaration. The statutory declaration will ensure that the candidate has applied his mind to the Constitutional limits of the Presidency. It will then be inexcusable if he deliberately chooses to disregard the limits of the Constitution and makes promises or statements exceeding this role.",
            "Let us be very clear about this. We have put this into the rules, and I take it that anyone who runs for the Presidency should understand the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. If someone tries to bypass the letter of the law, by violating the spirit of the law, I think I leave it to the good judgement of our electorate. That means that we have to double our efforts to help all Singaporeans understand the roles prescribed for our Elected Presidency. They are the Singapore Elected Presidency and not the elected presidency of some other countries, with their own unique define rules.",
            "The Singapore Elected Presidency has two main rules. One, a custodial function for the reserves and appointments of key appointment holders in the civil service. Two, as a unifying symbol for our nation. These are the two cleared rules for the Elected Presidency of Singapore.",
            "We will also step up educational efforts on the importance of the institution of the Elected President. As Mr Chua and Mr Ang had also rightly pointed out, there are fundamental differences between the Presidential Elections and the Parliamentary Elections. This is also a point made several times in the Constitution Commission's report, and attempts to draw parallels between the two can be attributed to persons being ill-informed, or worse, intentionally muddying the waters. Mr Ang Wei Neng asked whether we would be increasing airtime on national TV for candidates, and suggested two televised debates between candidates.",
            "The Government will increase the overall national TV airtime that candidates will have to allow the candidates a wide platform to share their views with the public. During Presidential Election 2011, there were two presidential campaign broadcasts for each candidate and one TV roundtable session which involved all four candidates.",
            "The Government will discuss the provision of additional air time for the candidates with Mediacorp. We will consider Mr Ang's suggestion on at least two televised debates when we discuss the format of the additional TV time with Mediacorp. The principle that the Government will adhere to is this − that we will provide candidates with more TV opportunities, which again, I emphasise, will allow for more effective national outreach.",
            "And if I may add, if you just think about it, this actually facilitates and level the playing field for those without established mechanisms to organise large outreach for themselves. The details will be made known closer to the elections, and candidates may reach out to voters on a variety of social media platforms, as currently allowed.",
            "Mr Ang asked about whether candidates can continue to meet voters face to face, and if they can organise speeches in places like the indoor stadium. The answer is yes. They can continue to conduct private election meetings at indoor locations.",
            "A meeting is considered private if it is not open to the general public. A private meeting will not require a permit under the Public Order Act. An example of a private meeting is where it is open to only a limited number of persons who are invited by name to attend the meeting. Candidates can hold such private meetings to engage specific groups of voters. No permit from the Police is required for private meetings. Permits from the Police will be required for meetings that are open to the general public. These would include election meetings that are organised on or behalf of a candidate and held during the election period, any time on or after Nomination Day but before the eve of the Polling Day.",
            "If a candidate intends to have a meeting that is open to the general public at the Indoor Stadium, he will have to obtain a permit from the Police.",
            "Now, let me touch on the timing of the polls that Mr Ang Wei Neng has spoken about.",
            "Mr Ang Wei Neng asked for specifics on the interim period between President Tan stepping down at the end of his term and a new President being sworn into office. During the interim, the acting President will exercise the powers of the President. According to Article 22N of the Constitution, if the office of the President becomes vacant, the Chairman of the Council of Presidential Advisers or, if he is unavailable, the Speaker, shall exercise the functions of the office of the President during the period between the date the office of President becomes vacant and the assumption of the office by the person declared elected as President. The acting President will have the powers of the President.",
            "Mr Ang suggested that the critics of the Government might have conspiracy theories that the Government will, in this interim period, ask the acting President to exercise his custodial powers. Let me quickly put such rumours to bed.",
            "The Government will be observing a convention in relation to the Elected President. Unless absolutely necessary, for example, in a crisis situation that requires the use of the reserves, the Government will respect that the rationale of the Elected Presidency is for an Elected President to be the second key to the reserves and to key appointments.",
            "Before I conclude, let me touch on some other points raised by various Members. Mr Vikram talked about people from mixed parentage. Yes, indeed, that is point that Mr Chua has also mentioned. Should there be such a person, and there would be more, we encourage the Community Committee to adopt an inclusive approach. In fact, actually, by adopting an inclusive approach, we are allowing more people to be identified with a certain community. So, actually, our approach is quite different from the approach as suggested by some other Members who wants to be even more clearly defined as to who forms what community.",
            "Now, if I take were to take the House a step back. What is the intention? And how do we meet this intent? The intent is simply this. A person identifies himself or herself with that particular community. And that community accepts that this particular person is from that community. Once these two conditions are met, the person identifies himself or herself with the community and the community accepts the person as a Member of that community, then, we have pretty much met our intent. In the hiatus-triggered mechanism, it will be counted towards that community.",
            "That community would not need to view short change because someone from that community did not represent them. Because in the intervening years, if someone has come forward to be associated with that community, and that community has accepted that person, then that community would have deemed that it has its own representative within the hiatus-triggered mechanism. We are going to adopt an inclusive approach rather than trying to define extra lines if you like to do this.",
            "On Mr Chua's point about giving ample notice, and this is the reason why the Government as many of the processes and procedures that we can, as early as possible, for prospective candidates, to be familiar with the new processes.",
            "Mdm Speaker, let me conclude. The changes that are being made to the Act, such as those pertaining to the Community Committee, are largely consequential to the amendments made to the Constitution that were passed by this House last November. The Government is putting in place the final pieces of the changes to the Elected Presidency. This set of amendments is the result of the review of the election processes.",
            "Today, we are gathered here to see how best to put in place the nuts and bolts to effect what we have discussed in November. Today is not the occasion for us to reopen the debate. And actually I am a bit confused. I thought the Workers' Party's proposal last November was on for a Senate, but today, was on Appointed President. But never mind. This is not the occasion for us to do that today. Based on what we have passed in November, this proposed set of changes are to put in place the nuts and bolts for us to effect the changes that we have agreed to, in November.",
            "I spoke at the end of my speech about campaigning methods and the timing of the Presidential Elections this year. These do not require legislative changes, but the Government is of the view that we should announce them as early as possible to give potential candidates ample notice.",
            "Finally, I am heartened to hear Mr Chua's speech that the Chinese, Malay and Indian Chambers of Commerce are in agreement that meritocracy and multi-racialism are two important pillars of Singapore's success, and this is what I have spoken about in my Malay and Chinese speeches.",
            "This Government has never shied away from acting decisively to strengthen the institutions of the state to ensure a better Singapore for our people. We proceed to do so because we consider this to be in the best long-term interest of our country, and we will take time to explain the changes to our people.",
            "The Government believes that the changes to the Elected Presidency will continue to ensure that the office will be held by someone who fulfils the stringent qualification criteria, ensuring meritocracy is not compromised, and will also be held by persons of different communities, reflecting the multi-racial nature of Singapore.",
            "Throughout the entire process of consultation and changes to the Elected Presidency, the Government has always kept the end goal in mind: ensuring that the Elected President continues to play an important stabiliser role in our system, making sure that our reserves and our key positions are not compromised, and making sure that the Presidency is not politicised, and making sure that the President continues to be, as it was from its inception in the person of Mr Yusof Ishak, a symbol of our unity for the country.",
            "With that, Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, and urge all Members to give your support to the Bill."

I do not think the Minister has addressed my point directly and that is that the Constitution (Amendment) Bill that was passed in November specifically asked Parliament to make these definitions: to define the definition profit after tax, and also shareholders' equity. The Bill in last November also required Parliament to prescribe what amounts to insolvency event. But what we find in the Bill today is that Parliament is passing this job on to the Minister to do and the purported guidelines in section 5C(2) and (3) are too general. They just talk about the Minister having to have regard to the general law, to accounting standards but these definitions are not before the House today. So, I would like the Minister to comment on whether he agrees with me that actually Parliament is not doing what the Constitution (Amendment) Bill has asked to us to do with regard to these definitions for private sector candidates.",
            "The second clarification concerns the counting of reserved elections. I think in Parliament in November the Government has already accused me of the things that Mr Chan has just repeated and I have also answered that in November to say that I am not accusing the Government or the Prime Minister of not telling the truth or that the AGC's advice was not given. My point was simply that people find it hard to understand why Wee Kim Wee counts as the first Elected President. And if the advice from the AGC is such, it would be helpful if the Government could consent to publishing it so that people can understand or try to understand the reasoning. That was the point being made.",
            "And he talked about the fact that I am a lawyer and I can understand why clients may want to have confidential communications. But the fact also remains that clients can choose to waive the confidentiality if they find that there is a purpose in publishing it. So, I am just asking for more illumination on why we are counting from President Wee Kim Wee.",
            "The third point which the Minister made was refuting what I had said was perception of Singaporeans, including myself, that the sudden announcement to count the coming election for President as reserved is in view of what happened at the elections in 2011. I thank him for his sermon on how the Government always thinks long term but I would like to put this question which I have received from my residents which I did put in November, but I do not think I received an answer to it, and that is if the Government is not passing these laws for short-term purposes, why does the Government not agree to defer these changes for one Presidential election? Since you said it is not a short-term purpose, why not? I do not recall an answer to that.",
            "The last clarification I would like to ask the Minister is in his opening speech earlier, I think he mentioned that both sides of the House agreed in November that there should be a difference between Presidential elections and Parliament elections. I am not sure what he actually meant by that. From what I recall, our position has been that the Head of State, we believe, if you want him to be a unifying figure, making him go through elections is inconsistent with that. I do not think that our Members went on to suggest how the campaign rules of Presidential elections could be refined because we do not believe that the President should go through an election."

            ": Mdm Speaker, Ms Sylvia Lim's first point on eligibility criteria. What Parliament is doing and asking the Minister to do is to make sure that whatever prevailing accountancy rules that are being practised is adhered to. That surely is better than what we here being not be in the profession to make a set of rules and then have it updated. I think the accountants amongst us, the people in the financial industry amongst us, will know that the conventions, the rules and the practices in the industry evolve. We are setting ourselves, benchmarking ourselves to these high standards that are agreed to by the professional bodies. And that I think it is an even better and a stronger set of measures than we setting something in place and having to update it as regularly as what the accounting professions might be capable of.",
            "On the second point about the reserve election, I am glad that Ms Lim has confirmed that you are not casting any aspirations on Prime Minister Lee's integrity and if that is the case then the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Teo Chee Hean, have explained in November why the counting start from the second term of President Wee Kim Wee's term. That is because President Wee Kim Wee was the first President to exercise the powers under the new Elected Presidency Act.",
            "On the second related point, you asked whether clients can choose to waive the advice and I think I have answered you − which that as a lawyer you know that there will be circumstances where you can choose to release the advice and you can choose not to release the advice and what we have done is no different. So, unless you are going back to challenge and casting doubt on the Prime Minister's integrity, the Prime Minister has stated on record in this House that it has taken advice from the Attorney-General. We take the Prime Minister for it and it is the Prime Minister's prerogative as to whether he wishes to release the advice as you have said.",
            "On the third point about the claim that this is a sudden announcement, I would just make two points: number one, we have had at this debate for a very long time, for more than one year. The process was transparent. We set up the Constitutional Commission. We invited the Workers' Party and members of the public to present. The Workers' Party's position was that it would not appear before the Constitutional Commission to present its views, but it will come to this House. Last year, the Workers' Party came to this House with a proposal for a Senate. We have debated that and we have made our own conclusions and we have moved on from there. So, I do not think this is a sudden movement.",
            "The second response to the third point that you mentioned, Deputy Prime Minister Teo has also shared with this House why we are making the movement now. As what the Constitutional Commission says, if there is a reason for us to act, then it is the onus of this Government to act in the best interest of this country decisively. That is why we have decided to do it in this term of Government.",

Every Singaporean, regardless of new citizens or old citizens, make the same pledge of allegiance to this country. They have the privileges of being a Singaporean. They have also the responsibilities of being a Singaporean. As to whether they can best represent and unite Singaporeans, I think it is best left to the judgement of the Singaporean electorate. And I think Singaporeans are wise and discerning, so I do not think we need to overly prescribe this.",
            "The question about how the Community Committee works and I think we have established precedence because this is how we have assessed the eligibility of the Malay candidates and the Indian and the Other Minority candidates for the parliamentary elections in the past. And that has served us well and the same mechanism will continue to work.",
            "On the issue of language, I would say that the community committee and the respective sub-committees will need to assess the person holistically. Yes, language will be one of the criteria. But we are also keenly aware that all of us, regardless of our race, language or religion, may practise our religions slightly differently, may live our lifestyles differently. But the key is this: do the respective sub-committees consider the person belonging to their community, as the package, holistically? That is the key point.",
            "As to how Committees work, I would not want to prescribe their role and it will be not my remit to comment on how they should go about doing their function. But the philosophy has never changed. The philosophy is that, as a package, do you believe that this person belongs to your community. And I believe that the people in the committees are wise enough to know how to make the judgement call, considering all the factors that you have mentioned."

            ":Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"",
            "The Planning Act, administered by the Urban Redevelopment Authority or URA, establishes the legal basis for the regulation of development, conservation, and land use planning in Singapore.",
            "As our built environment becomes denser, and land development becomes more complex, URA has to apply a keener eye to guide development plans so as to safeguard the vibrancy and liveability of our urban space. The amendments proposed in this Bill have three broad aims.",
            "First, to enhance the planning levers for URA to ensure a more liveable city; second, to strengthen the regulatory regime for development plans, including penalties to deal with violations of planning controls; and third, to calibrate and simplify the administrative processes involved in the execution of the Act. I will go through these three in more detail.",
            "Firstly, let me touch on the first point of enhancing planning levers. Currently, URA may grant planning permission subject to certain conditions and technical requirements that developers have to fulfil. This allows URA to establish and advance good practices and design specifications that serve the public good.",
            "The Bill amends the Act to supplement the conditions that URA can place on developers seeking planning permission. These additional conditions aim chiefly to create a more liveable and walkable cityscape, for example, through the provision of public spaces and pedestrian connections, and guiding the external appearance of buildings, like the night lighting of building facades.",
            "The Bill also clarifies the persons who are required to comply with a planning condition. Failure to comply with these conditions will amount to a breach of planning control, which is an offence. This is to ensure that the public can continue to enjoy the pleasant environment and connectivity that was planned for at the outset, even if developments undergo a change of owners.",
            "That is the first limb, which is to enhance the planning levers. Next, let me touch on the provisions in the Bill to strengthen the regulatory regime and there are several amendments in this regard.",
            "Let me begin with the role of Qualified Persons (QPs). The Bill introduces provisions relating to the responsibility of QPs, who are professionals such as architects, engineers and surveyors. Currently, developers applying for planning or conservation permission are not required by the Act to appoint a QP to prepare the plans and make submissions to URA, although in practice, most of them do so. The Bill amends the Act to require that owners or developers appoint a QP to prepare these submissions to URA, in accordance with the Act's or URA's requirements.",
            "The developer will similarly have to appoint a QP to supervise the development or works. And this QP will have to notify URA if the works deviate from the approved plans or planning conditions, take reasonable steps to prevent deviations, and submit reports or declarations as required by URA. This will minimise the need for subsequent rectification works, which can be costly for the developer or property owner. URA will be empowered to require the developer to submit as-built plans prepared by a land surveyor to facilitate cross-checking against plans which are initially approved.",
            "With QPs engaged throughout the key stages of the development process and held accountable for the discharge of their professional work, the new provisions in the Act will ensure that planning controls and regulatory standards are observed in the course of development. This serves to safeguard the quality of the environment, and at the same time, maintains good practices and overall standards in the industry. Minor works and simple applications may reasonably be exempted from these requirements.",
            "Another aspect of strengthening the regulatory regime is to have enhanced powers of investigation which this Bill will provide for.",
            "In particular, where URA officers believe that persons might have knowledge of a violation, the officers will be empowered to require these persons to attend interviews and question them. Apart from verbally examining witnesses and recording statements, URA will also be able to require the production of information or documents relevant to the violation, and to take video evidence on site. Where necessary, officers will be able to effect forced entry to carry out their investigation.",
            "This broad set of provisions is aligned with the enforcement powers of other agencies.",
            "There are also stricter penalties for unauthorised development or works because where violations are uncovered, the Bill puts in place a series of penalties for the offences under the Act.",
            "The current level of fines is too low to serve as a strong deterrent against unlawful activity or conduct. For example, URA has increasingly encountered unauthorised dormitories, including some repeat offenders. The penalties for demolishing a conserved building must also be enhanced as any unauthorised demolition will result in an irrevocable loss of our built heritage.",
            "With that in mind, the Bill will put in place stricter penalties. The maximum penalty for unauthorised development, works or subdivision for repeat offenders or for an offence involving the unauthorised use of any land or building for dormitory accommodation will be enhanced to include a custodial sentence. The maximum penalty for the partial or full demolition of a conserved building is a fine of $500,000 or a custodial sentence or both.",
            "The Bill also ensures that culpable parties are held to account by making it clear that permitting unauthorised development or works is an offence. An owner is presumed to have permitted unauthorised works carried out by his tenants or contractors, unless the owner can show that reasonable precaution was taken to prevent this. So, owners will have to exercise due diligence on their tenants and contractors.",
            "The Bill will make explicit the lawful boundaries pertaining to residential rental and subletting.",
            "Private residential properties should not be used for other purposes without planning approval, as there is a need to safeguard the living environment of residents in the neighbourhood. Where private residential properties are rented or sublet, URA has existing guidelines in place to ensure that these properties are not used to accommodate excessive numbers of occupants, and to make it clear that such properties are intended for long-term or permanent residence of at least six months.",
            "This Bill inserts a new Schedule into the Act, which lists the uses of residential property that are illegal without permission. The uses listed are short-term accommodation, and dormitory accommodation.",
            "\"Dormitory accommodation\", which requires planning permission, is defined by the Bill to mean accommodation by seven or more persons. In other words, without planning permission, it will be illegal to have more than six tenants. This cap does not apply to families, as the amendment expressly excludes persons who are related, along with their domestic helpers and care-givers. For units currently housing seven or eight persons, URA will allow the tenancy agreements to run their natural course, and will not clamp down on them before they expire.",
            "This set of regulations will apply only to private developments and will not apply to HDB flats, which come under a separate set of controls managed by HDB.",
            "I have covered the second broad component of provisions which relate to strengthening the regulatory regime. Thirdly, there are series of things we are doing in this Bill to streamline the administration of the Act.",
            "First, it allows URA to give preliminary advice to developers and property owners or their QPs on their proposals prior to submission of their development applications. This would be an added service for developers or their QP to seek a preliminary indication from URA, at an earlier stage, as to whether their proposal satisfies the relevant regulations or guidelines. The Bill provides for this additional service that URA will provide.",
            "Second, the Act currently allows URA to defer the payment of the development charge for charity organisations; and the Bill amends the Act to allow the deferral of this charge to be carried on to the next property owner, where the Minister approves of the deferral, for example, where the next owner is also a charitable organisation.",
            "Madam, the amendments to the Planning Act will ensure that our planning controls and regulations are up-to-date and relevant in guiding the physical development of Singapore. It will allow URA to be more effective in regulating planning violations, and ensuring that our physical living environment continues to be of a high quality.",
            "URA has consulted with stakeholders and professional institutes including the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) and the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) on the amendments to the Act. They have provided useful feedback, which have been taken into consideration in the drafting of this Bill. With that, Mdm Speaker, I beg to move."

            "Mdm Speaker, there is an old cautionary tale of an old man who wanted to buy an antique teapot. It was said that one day this old man walked passed a run-down knick-knack store and spotted an old ceramic teapot in the display, his eyes gleamed and a grin spread across his face. He walked in briskly and said to the young man sitting rather boredly behind the counter and said: \"Young man, I will give you $1,000 for that teapot in the window.\" The young salesman replied: \"That old dusty teapot? Why would you want it?\" Without explaining, the old man told him, \"Wrap it up, I will be back in an hour with the cash,\" before leaving the shop."
          ]
        },
        {
          "speaker": "[Mr Deputy Speaker",
          "content": [
            "The young salesman thought to himself that it was incredible that someone would pay such an amount, but thinking perhaps the old man saw something of value, he quickly brushed the teapot and washed it out, wiping it so well that a shine returned. When the old man returned, the young man said, \"Sir, I have polished it up and it is almost like new. I think it is now worth $2,000!\" In horror and almost immediately crestfallen, the old man said, \"My friend, sadly it is now worthless, for its worth was in the well-seasoned pot blackened by decades of tea-brewing. Now that it is new and polished, it is worthless to me.\"",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, our built environment is one that is more than functional. It plays a huge role in affecting a community, a nation, both psychologically as well as culturally. It marks where we have come from and where we are headed. Therefore, the Planning Bill has played an important role in ensuring that the built environment that we choose to live in, and not just one that we have no choice but to try to live in, is one that is dynamic and yet true to our history and our culture.",
            "Like that teapot, old may not always mean worthless and new may not always be valuable. Even as the Bill aims to create a delightful cityscape and a more walkable city, I hope that we take a moment to also ponder at what we have lost or might lose in the search of progress, in search of orderliness. Many of our heritage districts are wonderful to behold, picturesque, but to put it bluntly, they may be all but in name. They are often sterile, clean, clinical representations of their past; sometimes commercialised to the point of soulessness.",
            "Perhaps the grim is a mark of character of a building, of a district, that in our urge to be utilitarian and for progress, we lose some of what makes us, us. As the Bill hopes to give powers to both afford greater protection against unauthorised demolition or alterations to conserved buildings, and at the same time, create a delightful cityscape, we might have to ask ourselves how we can best achieve most in creating the cityscape that incorporates, and in fact, celebrates our built heritage.",
            "Whether by private hands or in the public interest, historic buildings are sometimes disappearing, not just physically but also slowly being drained of their souls. So, I seek the Minister's response on how best we should, not just as a government, but as custodians of our nation's collective storehouse of memories and history, preserve not just the shell of buildings but also the inner spirit and souls of our heritage buildings.",
            "Take the case in point of the Ellison Building at the corner of Bukit Timah and Selegie. It is perhaps a bit ironic that we have in one Ministry gazetted it as a heritage asset but in another, has had to take the hard decision to demolish it for the public good.",
            "In my recent work trips to the United Kingdom and Taiwan, private enterprise and some government initiatives have returned life to old derelict structures, imbuing them not just with a new vitality, but also one that continues with tradition and one that is exciting to a new audience, welcomed not just by locals but tourists alike. What more can we do so that our children and future generations of Singaporeans do not become poorer for the heritage that we lose?",
            "The Planning (Amendment) Bill sends a stronger signal with a custodial sentence being introduced, and the fine imposed being raised, but losing our heritage cannot be adequately compensated by a jail-term or half a million dollars. We need more than that, perhaps a stripping away of the licence of the developer or contractor involved in the destruction but, more importantly, also to educate Singaporeans on the importance of our built heritage.",
            "Let me now move on to a more enlightening topic in the Bill − that of lighting up our city. Who does not delight in a beautiful cityscape skyline? Most major cities have one that they are proud of. We have one that we should be proud of, too − a marriage of old and new − a story of our nation's development in one picture-perfect photo. But I hasten to ask, who is going to pay for it all? Under the new URA guidelines and requirements, new buildings will be required to conform to certain design aesthetics. Who would not agree that it would be nice to light up the skies every night? But just as we go about urging Singaporeans to conserve energy and utilities, lighting up the night sky may end up burning a fire in the wallet. So, greater clarity in this area on expenditure and control of expenditure, and use of utilities would be useful.",
            "With regard to the provision of public areas and pedestrian connections, I spent a working visit to Hong Kong late last year traversing the city centre and the civic district without once emerging into the direct sunlight or the light year-end drizzle. From skylinks to underground passages, you could cover a large portion of the financial and civic district with ease. Aiming towards this would certainly benefit Singaporeans and visitors alike, considering our very equatorial climate and fondness for the rain.",
            "I would like to seek the Minister's clarification on how disagreements between different building owners can be resolved, especially between newer buildings and older ones. If a building, especially older strata title ones, holds out from renovation or rebuilding, can the Ministry compel the building owners to make earlier provisions for connectivity, especially when the buildings serve as the middle of the sandwich between two newer developments that have already made provisions?",
            "In Hong Kong, I am given to understand that a large portion of the connected buildings are owned or managed by the same developer and, of course, it makes sense for them to have the connectivity planned early. In previous cases in Singapore, we have also seen new buildings which were required under the guidelines to provide linkages, but abutting buildings refusing to link up, resulting in gaps for pedestrians. Will this be sufficiently addressed by the amendments, and will abutting buildings also be compelled to make good on bridging the gaps?",
            "In terms of a peaceful living environment, one of the areas that perhaps gained most interest on infringements and enhanced powers of investigations provided to URA, has to do with how we keep the peace in our living environment, especially when there are units that have a higher proportion of subtenants. Many are understandably concerned about their neighbouring units being overcrowded, and their safe and peaceful living environment is made less so by strangers coming in and out or changing ever so often.",
            "I have a number of clarifications to seek from the Minister. Firstly, the amendment introduces a new Fourth Schedule that lowers the maximum number from eight to six. A custodial sentence is also introduced for infringements. This is well and good, but I am unable at the moment to reconcile the numbers with the guidelines that are set out separately by HDB. In 4-room and larger HDB flats, the number of subtenants allowed is nine. So, if a 4-room flat can have nine subtenants, the new limitations on private property, some of which would be bigger, seem to be out of sync.",
            "I am not advocating for the fact that we should increase the number of allowed subtenants to nine, but the question remains whether HDB guidelines should also correspondingly be revised to reflect this new reality in the Planning (Amendment) Bill. Why is this so? In terms of the new limitations, I am happy to learn from the Minister that those that already have more than six subtenants will be allowed to have their leases lapse.",
            "In terms of now legislating the minimum six months for short-term accommodation leases, this brings it in line with HDB sub-leasing requirements. But I understand that the URA guidelines have been in place since 2009 as guidelines. Why has it taken eight years for it to be legislated? Why now? Is it because of an increase in number of violations or number of complaints that we are, therefore, required to now legislate this?",
            "This legislation will also make a rather popular travel arrangement seemingly legal. I am sure many of us who travel are familiar with the AirBnB concept or even couch-surfing. I know that the Ministry is currently studying and drafting legislation, or propose legislation on regulations on new markets, such as AirBnB. But by codifying the amendments to the Planning (Amendment) Bill now, does it run counter to what is being planned for any new legislation in the future? How will the URA, therefore, police current AirBnB listings now that they will all be considered legal subletting?",
            "In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, from our national infrastructure and cityscape to where we live and who our neighbours are, the Planning (Amendment) Bill makes major changes to our built environment and how it would look like, now and into the future. Notwithstanding the questions I have raised, I give my support to the Bill."

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill, particularly for the amendments to address the provision of short-term accommodation, that is, for six consecutive months or less, in return for rent. With the insertion of the new subsection (3)(ca), failure to obtain written permission for this will be an offence.",
            "Many of my residents will appreciate this change, which states categorically that it will be illegal for owners to lease out their properties to short-term renters, unless they have a special permit.",
            "I have received numerous negative feedback from my constituents about the disamenity caused by such visitors. They have expressed their concerns about compromised security in their estates, the loss of privacy and the occasional disturbances.",
            "Despite URA's guidelines forbidding such rentals, thousands of condominium and room listings can be found on rental portals, such as Airbnb, Roomorama, PandaBed and HomeAway. Many of them can be rented for durations as short as one night.",
            "The Minister had shared with the House in a written reply in August last year that the URA took enforcement action against 36 cases of unauthorised short-term subletting in private residential premises in 2014, 23 cases in 2015, and 44 cases in the first six months of 2016.",
            "These figures are very much lower than the number of complaints received by the URA − 375 in 2014, 377 in 2015 and 161 in the first four months of 2016. I would like to ask the Minister why there is such a big gap in the numbers and whether URA has enough manpower and resources to follow up on the number of complaints.",
            "Many of my residents have complained to me that the problem lies in the lack of follow up or enforcement. Usually, the Police and the URA have the details, including the exact addresses and profiles of visitors. These beleaguered neighbours submit all the information required and hope for swift action to be taken. Unfortunately, the transient strangers continue to stream in.",
            "Due to the presence of these visitors, residents feel less safe and are perpetually on their guard. Such an uneasy atmosphere in an estate does not contribute to building neighbourly ties.",
            "Hence, I would like to suggest that the Minister consider giving the Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) more power and greater means at its disposal for enforcement.",
            "Finally, I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate on the penalties non-compliant property owners would face and what action will be taken against non-compliant owners who do not reside in Singapore and who continue to ignore warnings to desist from short-term rentals."

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore is a small, densely-populated nation that relies heavily on good urban planning to maximise our space and resources.

After all, home is a place for us to rest after a long day. My question is: why not extend this to HDB?",
            "Currently, for 4-room and bigger HDB units, the maximum number of persons residing is to a maximum of nine people. Why the disparity? Private housing − six persons, but HDB, which is even more compact, can house up to nine. I urge that this maximum number be whittled down to no more than six persons also. An overcrowded apartment can be very noisy and a constant source of stress and irritation to the neighbours. Residents have come to me with feedback about their neighbours' rowdy tenants. Furthermore, some of these tenants would leave footwear and other belongings along the common corridor, which is not only unsightly but inconveniences the other neighbours. During my recent house visit, a resident complained to me about a neighbour's subletted flat. She said that the tenants even spit at the lift lobby, smoke at the lift lobby, and they loiter around the corridors. Quite often, it is because there are a lot of people in that flat.",
            "On a related note, there needs to be stronger enforcement against homeowners who rent out their homes as temporary accommodation to overseas visitors.",
            "Currently, HDB and URA regulations dictate that renting a whole unit or individual room is only allowed for long-term stays of six months or more. This is a longstanding rule that applies to both private property and HDB housing. However, judging by the number of rentals still available online, this generally seems to be enforced only when people complain. In the meantime, many residents have to endure the ill effects. I have residents complaining to me about tourists on their floor, moving luggage in and out at odd hours of the day, disturbing their rest.",
            "I would like to ask what is the Government's stand on such short-term renting? Instead of having this \"one-eye open, one-eye closed\" policy, we should state our stand clearly and take enforcement action immediately. Why wait until there are complaints for action to be taken? What I understood is that there are about 6,000 listings online. Trends like Airbnb rentals are rising, but I think we need to look into how to balance the two.",
            "Some countries have designated certain apartment buildings for rental to foreigners. This way, locals know of the policy before they decide whether to buy that apartment. In Japan, hosts have to obey local laws set by Japan's Hotel Business Act which governs overnight stays. Just like these countries, we should look deeper into alternative ways to deal with this new trend. Meanwhile, I think everybody should stick to the law, and I hope that our relevant agencies will take action.",
            "Next, moving on to structural issues, I would like to suggest extending this Planning Bill to include two things. First, imposing developer to build covered linkways from the condominium or executive condominium (EC) to the nearest bus stop. I think many of our new HDB BTOs have a covered linkway to the nearest bus stop but not the new condominium or the new EC. And later on, when the residents shift in, they will ask for this new covered linkway which is very difficult for us to implement after that.",
            "Secondly, is to facilitate linkages between buildings, like what Hong Kong's Planning Department does with their Urban Design Guidelines. This will make walking in the city more pleasant, with better connectivity. For those who have been to Hong Kong, I am sure you enjoy shopping and walking in Hong Kong much more than in Singapore because you can walk from one building to another building without walking under the sun because the buildings are all connected. I know that it is not easy, but we must start somewhere. We can learn from Hong Kong's experience.",
            "On another point, I also wish this Bill could give more assistance to those who live in landed property and have difficulty obtaining access to do up their house, for example, plastering their external walls. I think all of us know that it is good practice to plaster the external walls so that you do not water seepage. But I have seen cases from time to time, residents telling me that they really have problems in getting access because of the objections from neighbours and then when they go to URA or BCA, no one can help them. I hope that with this Planning amendment, we can look into cases like this. And please allow me to summarise in Chinese.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, home should be our harbour. However, the neighbour's tenants can sometimes disturb the peace of other residents greatly.",
            "This amendment provides that private housing can only house a maximum of six tenants. This will help to improve the situation faced by some residents. However, currently 4-room or larger HDB flats can house a maximum of nine tenants. Tenants in HDB flats live in even closer proximity to their neighbours; therefore can the Government consider reducing the maximum number of people who can stay in an HDB flat to six people as well?",
            "On another note, short-term rental is becoming more and more popular. Although current rules dictate that no residence can be rented out for less than six months, there are plenty of such short-term listings online. Is it that the Government will only act after people complain?",
            "Rather than adopting this \"one eye open one eye closed\" approach, why do we not explore other solutions? For example, we can allow short-term rentals for certain apartments as long as all the residents are agreeable to it.",
            "Lastly, I hope that this Amendment Bill will allow residents living in condominiums and ECs to enjoy covered linkways which connect their condominium or EC to the nearest bus-stop, just like HDB residents do. After all, the Government has always been encouraging Singaporeans to take public transportation.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with our limited land, urban planning is crucial to maintain a good quality of life and have good quality buildings. In this age of rapid developments, it is important that we frequently review the rules and update them whenever necessary. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the amendments."

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill which will strengthen URA's enforcement powers and facilitate its administrative and planning processes. However, in my view there are some points for further review which I would like to share with the House.",
            "The first is regarding the reduction of permissible maximum number of unrelated persons for subletting, from the current eight to six persons.",
            "I would like to suggest that this criterion be refined to take into account the size of the unit and the actual number of rooms per unit. The universal cap of six persons per unit may not be optimal. For smaller units, this could result in overcrowding. For bigger units, it is an unnecessary constraint which would deprive owners of additional rental income.",
            "Casting a stronger focus on safety and hygiene, the Ministry could look into specifying available square footage per occupant and the level of amenities, such as toilets and bathrooms, provided on a per person basis. Such specifications will set the basic standards for living conditions and prevent owners from subdividing their units further to create more rooms. This will help to enhance not only the well-being of the occupants but of the neighbours as well.",
            "Next, on the provision of dormitory accommodation for seven or more persons and short-term accommodation of six consecutive months or less for rent will be deemed a change of use for a dwelling-house for which failure to obtain written permission will be an offence.",
            "With many rooms and residences in Singapore now being offered on Airbnb, it would be advisable to provide this group of owners with more clarity on whether they should withdraw their listings to avoid running afoul of the law.",
            "Another area of concern is the proposed section 12A. The owner of a property must satisfy on a balance of probabilities that he has taken \"all reasonable precautions\" to prevent the contravention by the tenant or contractor or demonstrate \"due diligence\" but could not have prevented the contravention by the tenant or contractors.",
            "The challenge here is what constitutes \"all reasonable precautions\" or \"exercise due diligence\". These are grey areas that will only be decided if the case goes before a Court. The owner may think that he has taken \"all reasonable precautions\" but the authority may view otherwise.",
            "Some of us may recall that many years ago, a number of landlords were charged for harbouring illegal immigrants. The law did not spell out the requirements and duty of the owners but merely stated the requirement of \"due diligence\". The Courts took pain in those years to interpret what constituted \"due diligence\". The result then was that the bulk of the cases were slapped with convictions rather than acquittal. Subsequently in 2004 and 2007, section 57 of the Immigration Act was amended twice and new sub-sections were inserted to explain the kind of acts that the house owners must carry out to avoid prosecution.",
            "Similar ambiguity if applied to section 12A could cause undue stress on owners and result in unnecessary legal issues and costs. This is especially so if the owners are elderly, physically impaired or illiterate. In some cases, the owners have assigned power of attorney to a third party to lease to tenants and in the event of a contravention of section 12A, does it mean that the owners would still be taken to task?",
            "In my view, section 12A could be more prescriptive in listing out the due diligence steps that owners should take, such as requesting the tenant or contractor to sign an undertaking or affirm a Statutory Declaration."

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, like any community or society, the locals expect to live in an environment that they are accustomed to, where they see familiar faces, where they understand each other's culture and respect each other's religion. It is the same whether you are in Singapore or in Germany or United Kingdom.",
            "Today, with the popularity of Airbnb, a Singaporean can, if there are no rules in place, wake up one day and find himself being stared at by, say, someone from another country staying next door and a new one every other week or month or so. I am sure it would raise his/her suspicions and he or would be asking himself or herself: \"What and who is this?\" And, this is what will happen if we do not control property owners who turn their premises into a hostel or and use it for Airbnb activities. Notwithstanding, Singapore also needs to embrace disruptive technologies or emerging opportunities such as Airbnb and others especially in an environment of softer growth and to capitalise on existing unproductive assets.",
            "Hence, I am pleased that it is now spelt out in the Bill, the rules that prohibit short-term lease to a large number of unrelated persons. With these rules in place, it will be easier to carry out enforcement against property owners who use their premises for prohibited activities. Perhaps, it would be good if the Minister could clarify what will be its policy on Airbnb going forward, if the owner of a premises apply for a licence to use it for vacation homes, for example? Thanks to mainstream and social media, it is widely known that renting out homes for short-term stays is in fact forbidden. But this is not stopping Singaporean Airbnb listings from popping up ever so frequently. I think it is important that the Ministry takes a clear stand on it or it will be assumed that the regulation is a paper tiger. In this market where some flat owners are hard pressed to get tenants, some of them have resorted to renting out their units to short-term travellers.",
            "Next, I note that the URA has been given more power in the decision-making process with regard to the physical appearance and design of buildings, with the goal of making Singapore a delightful and walkable city. In relation to the latest rule on public spaces on private property to meet new design guidelines such as providing ample shade, public seating and connectivity between buildings either above or below ground. But the question is: how will this affect the cost of development for the building owner? Will this deter old buildings from being re-developed? In my constituency, there are quite a number of condominiums, for example, which may be affected by these changes in the Bill and also in the city-centre as well.",
            "With so many different designs for buildings in Singapore, both residential and commercial, we need to have some coordination in their appearance. What can be done to ensure that there is some cohesion in the design, unless we are open to a bit of differentiation and chaos and that whether there is good connectivity for pedestrians to move from one to another and what it impacts as well?"

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, the amendments in this Bill are encouraging and assist to explicitly explain certain details in existing rules which have been unclear or not legalised for enforcement to be carried out. With the rules clearly spelt for enforcement purpose, it will positively support enforcement personnel to conduct their duties, hold the owners responsible and render early intervention to some local issues without wastage of our public resources.",
            "The amendment to subletting of a property to an excessive number of unrelated persons in this Bill, I feel, is a welcome move. Not only does it assist enforcers to conduct their checks, it also prevents situations where safety is a concern and the relevant authorities were unable to gain access into properties to take the necessary actions. Such stories are not unheard of during my house visits and Meet-the-People sessions (MPS). Here, I would like to raise a few areas which I felt the Ministry should further consider as enhanced enforcement powers may not suffice under some conditions.",
            "One, in this amendment, it only refers to private properties and not HDB. But, with regard to concerns on overcrowding and safety, the size of HDB flat generally poses more of these challenges given its limited space compared to a landed property. I have received numerous feedbacks from the residents living in HDB flats of suspected units housing more than the specified number of tenants that is allowed under current guidelines. And HDB had difficulties locating the owners, especially those who live overseas, and unable to conduct the appropriate checks of the suspected units. I suggest that the Ministry consider applying the rule on the basis of number of people per the built up area which is the GFA regardless of public or private property. In addition, all owners must be made to provide contactable details when declaring their property for rental and held accountable if their tenants refuse to co-operate with the authorities.",
            "Second, during my house visits, I encountered units that are occupied by elderly couples or those living alone with a domestic helper. These people are understandably sometimes reluctant to provide access of their premises to the authorities due to uncertainty and lack of trust of strangers. The case in point is not a concern of excessive subletting but on other areas like the need for authorities to inspect the presence of mosquito breeding, building structure conformance, and so on. Should the Bill be passed, how can the authorities assist these elderly to ensure they are safeguarded through a process to provide access and not fear being penalised for not complying on the first instance?",
            "Third, while the current focus is about non-compliance being the responsibility of homeowners and developers of the property, we may have neglected the role that the property agents play in such transactions. In cases where excessive subletting occur, what is the probability that rental agreements were made without the assistance of a property agent and that the agent was unaware of tenancy conditions in the said property bridging stipulated guidelines? And if proven so, will the property agent be equally liable of committing the offence as the home owner? I would urge the Ministry to consider having some of the enforcement terms as compulsory clauses within the rental agreements and the contractual agreements between the owner and the property agents. Tougher measures have to be taken for those who violate and possibly imposing a debarment period in which the owners are not allowed to rent their property.",
            "Enforcement is often viewed as an essential process for checks on compliance when the rules or guidelines are in place. However, when it is not explicitly written in legal terms, it is usually difficult for the enforcers to take any recourse against those who offend. As such, I support the amendment and the introduction of sections 13, 19A and 20A. The requirement to appoint qualified persons (QPs) is absolutely necessary as the process of compliance during planning, construction and the final building structure has tremendous implication on safety. Be it for conservation, commercial or residential purpose, safety is an aspect that we cannot compromise. If the buildings were not constructed in accordance to approved plans, the cost of rectification will be huge and, at times, irreplaceable.",
            "It is likely that many owners are layman when it comes to building design, materials used and they are ignorant of the building requirements and the terminologies. Many have dreams of what they hope their final design would be for their prized possession. However, many cannot articulate these details nor have any idea how the process may be like until they embark on some of these projects. Some errant developers may present false claims of their capabilities and hard-sell before the contract is signed.",
            "This was exactly the issue that one of my residents faced recently. Like most owners, they had entrusted the project solely to the contractors. Being a first-time owner of a landed property, they are unsure of the processes involved. Unknowingly, their trust in the contractor whom they thought would have the architect, the QP appointed to supervise the project turned out to be a nightmare for them.",
            "Often, owners would not have sight of the new developments in the building rules and are technically challenged to understand the construction progress or even check against what materials had been used. This is even more difficult when the structures are embedded or concealed. Before they can reach the stage of obtaining the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP), it would have entailed legal suits and caused homeowners unwarranted stress; notwithstanding the strain it creates in our mediation and the litigation systems.",
            "To reduce the frequency of such incidences, I would like to ask the Minister on the validation process of the QPs, how to ensure their certifications are kept relevant and that these QPs have duly carried out their duties and tasks before they endorse and sign off on the approval documents. If the QPs and/or developers were found to have violated the rules, how can it be made known to the public so that future consumers would not fall prey to the unruly players?",
            "On this note, Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill and look forward that the inclusion of these new clauses and legalising the terms would help our enforcers to carry out their duties more efficiently, giving rise to safer buildings and developments in our city state."

            "However, what we are doing in this Bill is codifying this URA subletting guideline and I have concerns about this. My concern is that this Bill might be passed too hastily. In May 2016, URA stated that the results of the public consultation on short-term rentals were \"split, with no clear consensus\". The URA, by its own admission, added that \"this issue on short-term stays is complex, multi-faceted, has wide-ranging implications and it warrants a careful and balanced review,\" and, therefore, it \"needed more time to study the issue\". I stress that these statements were published not more than a year ago. While this Bill might be passed, can the Minister clarify if his Ministry will be studying this issue further, will be conducting more public consultations and will do a further review on this?",
            "The sharing economy, while disruptive, is here to stay. We have witnessed this with Uber and Grab. Likewise, home-sharing concepts like Airbnb and PandaBed are here to stay. Passing the law to combat the real or perceived negativities of the home-sharing economy diverges from the approach that was taken against similarly disruptive entrants in Uber and Grab.",
            "We are also ignoring the popularity of such \"disruptive\" home-sharing concepts, especially with the younger generation and how this might ultimately also affect our tourism industry. Just taking into consideration Airbnb, do we really want to ban a company which, according to some media reports, boasts more than a million listings across 190 countries in 34,000 cities with more than 25 million guests served, from operating in Singapore?",
            "At last year's National Day Rally, the Prime Minister noted that there are two ways to respond to disruption: to close Singapore off and try to stop people from using the new technology, or embrace change and let the disruption happen − but help the incumbents adapt. The Prime Minister said that all models are not working. New models are coming thick and fast, and we have to adjust and keep up because of technology and globalisation, and the disruption will happen over and over again, relentlessly.",
            "I hope that we do not close Singapore off to the home-sharing economy and stop Singaporeans and tourists from using such platforms in Singapore. I believe that we should embrace this disruption and explore ways to help all stakeholders adapt to the new normal. We should regulate rather than ban.",
            "Given that home-sharing platforms have many users and customers, does the URA have enough manpower to undertake full enforcement measures in the first place? How many enforcement officers does URA have to enforce this? Following the passing of this Bill, will it require all the listings ‒ all 6,000 or so, as my colleague Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has stated ‒ on these home-sharing platforms to be removed?",
            "And, lastly, has the URA conducted research on how other countries have regulated the home-sharing concept? Can the Minister share if we are considering following some of these regulations?",
            "Lastly, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for introducing a custodial sentence for repeat offenders of permitting unauthorised development and subdivision. This is necessary because recalcitrance at the expense of damaging Singapore's heritage and identity should never be tolerated. I am heartened by the addition of section 24B to the Act, which adds another layer of protection to conservation areas in Singapore.",
            "I note that in discharging their duties, qualified persons are required to notify the URA of any contravention or non-compliance with any provision, condition, requirement or plans in relation to this Act. Could the Minister consider adding a time factor into this obligation, to notify \"without delay\" or \"immediately\" or \"as soon as practicable\"? I believe that the earlier the non-compliance is reported, the higher the chance that we could prevent or mitigate problems that may arise from that non-compliance. Sir, notwithstanding my comments, I stand in support of the Bill."

            "As echoed by other Members who have spoken earlier on this Bill, I, too, would like to mention that, firstly, under the new Fourth Schedule, URA will reduce the maximum number of unrelated persons a property can be rented to from eight to six. The intention is to deal with the recurrent problem of subletting to too many tenants, resulting in overcrowding. However, as properties vary greatly in terms of size and configuration, may I recommend that the Ministry limit the number of tenants based on the sizes and types of rooms of the residences?",
            "Secondly, I would like to advise that we seek consistency in our criteria for both public and private housing. Currently, a Singapore citizen is allowed to sublet the entire HDB flat after fulfilling the Minimum Occupation Period. The maximum number of subtenants allowed in each flat is based on flat type. For 1-room and 2-room flats, four sub-tenants; for 3-room flats, six sub-tenants; and for 4-room and bigger flats, nine sub-tenants. Private properties should be subjected to similar caps as well.",
            "Thirdly, I would like to request for greater protection for tenants. In the last few years, there have been cases of owners who collected deposits and sublet the same property to multiple tenants. Does the Ministry keep track of how many such cases of complaints have occurred in the past five years? Will the Ministry implement measures to deter such cases from recurring? In addition, often, owners and their tenants have disputes over whether the deposits should be returned, and some owners keep the deposits at the end of the leases without valid reasons. Would the Ministry consider setting up a Government-approved lease deposit account in which landlords are required to place their tenants' deposits? This will help enhance protection for tenants and facilitate recovery of their deposits.",
            "I would also like to ask how many cases there have been of tenants subletting to other tenants in the last five years. What are the typical profiles of such tenants and what actions have been taken against them? If they are foreigners, would the Ministry consider banning them from working and living in Singapore?",
            "In addition, would the Minister share how many cases of disputes between neighbours involving Singapore residents and foreign tenants there were in the past five years? Does the Ministry keep track of the nature of the disputes so that we will be able to formulate better preventive measures?",
            "Finally, would the Minister share with the House how the Ministry works with MCSTs, ICA, the police and Neighbourhood Committees to enforce and regulate the private property rental market?"

            ":Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members of the House who have risen in support of the Bill and for sharing their views. Let me now address the points that were raised in the course of the debate.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe all the Members in this House would agree that a liveable and vibrant city must have attractive public spaces, good connectivity and also a built heritage that strengthens our sense of memories and shared experiences. And this is what the amendment in the Bill strives to achieve, by strengthening the planning levers under URA. So, in response to some of the queries raised by Members, I can confirm that URA will, indeed, make use of these provisions to require developers, where it comes to new developments, to put in place connectivity and better building standards, including more covered linkways between buildings, or even to nearby bus-stops. That is the very intention of this Bill, and URA will, where meaningful to provide for such connectivity, require developers to do so for new developments.",
            "For existing developments, the provisions in the Bill do not envisage an imposition on the existing buildings. But should the property owners of these existing buildings choose to redevelop their properties or choose to make A&A in their properties and they have to seek URA's planning permission to do so, then that would be an opportune time for URA to impose these new conditions.",
            "I think many Members would be supportive of these additions and these provisions to impose conditions on developers to enhance connectivity and building standards. But there were some Members, in particular, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Alex Yam, who were concerned about the cost impact and how this will impact on the building and perhaps even on residents.",
            "Generally, the cost of providing these features is a small component of the overall development costs. In addition, URA will not require every development to provide public space or connectivity. It will do so judiciously and where it is meaningful to do so. These requirements will only be applied, for example, to strategically located sites in key areas or where there is provision or if it is meaningful to provide for connectivity.",
            "In addition, the public spaces that are required may be excluded from the overall floor area, so there would be no impact on the development potential of the sites. So, there is a way to balance the different requirements and we will be mindful that even as we impose these provisions, they do not lead to a significant escalation of costs.",
            "Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked a separate matter about access to neighbouring property to execute works such as the plastering of walls. I understand this is a concern very often found in private residential areas. It is really not so much a planning issue but a matter of resolving disputes between two property owners. URA cannot override the property owner's rights, but it will help to facilitate mediation between neighbours to resolve issues, if necessary.",
            "That is my first reply on the broad area of planning levers. Next, let me touch on the points that Members have raised on the responsibilities of homeowners, and potentially even extending that to other stakeholders like property agents. And here, there was also a mix of views.",
            "Ms Joan Pereira and Miss Cheryl Chan wanted to be sure that we can take suitable action against homeowners and property agents responsible for offences, but I believe Mr Chong Kee Hiong sought assurance that homeowners would not be burdened unnecessarily by the amendments. And again, it is about striking the right balance.",
            "Where any property has been misused or unauthorised works done, URA will ensure that culpable parties are all taken to task, whether for committing or abetting the offence. For homeowners who do not reside in or are not in Singapore, URA will obtain the owner's home address from ICA and IRAS and they still have to answer the charges if there is a violation of the rules. I think this is in response to Ms Joan Pereira's question.",
            "If there is evidence to show that a property agent is complicit in an infringement, they will be referred to the Council of Estate Agents (CEA), who will sanction them accordingly. I think that is something that Miss Cheryl Chan had asked about.",
            "When it comes to enforcement, URA will, if necessary, beef up its enforcement capability and resources but it will also work with other agencies, for example, ICA, SPF, MOM, SCDF, NEA, as Mr Gan Thiam Poh had suggested, to share information on any suspected cases of unauthorised use of private property and take the necessary enforcement actions.",
            "Miss Cheryl Chan shared the concern of elderly homeowners who may be taken to task for not assisting enforcement checks. I would like to assure her that URA officers will take a reasonable approach in enforcement. They will first identify themselves when there is a need to inspect premises and also explain the intentions of their visit. Officers will not force the occupants to allow them to enter, unless repeated requests to enter have been denied or they assess that critical evidence will be lost if they cannot gain access in a timely manner.",
            "Several Members, including Mr Alex Yam and Mr Chong Kee Hiong, asked about the precautions that building owners or property owners would have to take and what is deemed to be appropriate due diligence. I think it is very difficult and not so practical to draw out all the different scenarios and the different due diligence steps that have to be taken in legislation itself, but I would just like to assure Members that URA would carefully assess the culpability of persons involved, given all the facts available on each particular case at hand and ensure that owners will have no part in directing the violation are not unduly penalised. URA will not make egregious demands on owners, and whether or not due diligence has been exercised, will be assessed reasonably.",
            "Another section of the provisions in the amendment Bill for which there were some comments was on the role of the Qualified Persons (QPs).",
            "Miss Cheryl Chan asked about the professionalism of QPs. The Board of Architects and the Professional Engineers Board oversee the professional development of architects and engineers, respectively. For instance, in order to renew their Practising Certificates annually, both architects and engineers have to meet \"continuing professional development\" requirements to update their competencies.",
            "All registered architects and engineers are listed on their relevant Board's website. So, if there is any question or doubt about whether or not this is a Qualified Person, you can look at the website of the relevant Board. The professions have their regulatory regimes in place to ensure that those listed are competent to discharge their duties lawfully. The Board of Architects and the Professional Engineers Board will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against registered professionals who fall foul of regulations. Depending on the severity, the QP may be fined, suspended or deregistered. This Bill also gives URA more powers to charge QPs in court if necessary, for instance if they had provided false declarations.",
            "Mr Louis Ng suggested that a time factor be added to QPs' obligation to notify URA of contravention or non-compliance of requirements under the Act. Other than notifying the authorities, the Bill already requires the QP to \"take all reasonable steps to immediately stop or cease the contravention\". This is ultimately what matters, as conditions at a construction site are constantly changing. So, I believe that the provisions in the Bill are sufficient to meet the Member's concern in this regard.",
            "Next, let me talk about occupancy cap. It was, again, one of the topics here that has attracted quite a number of views.",
            "Miss Cheryl Chan, Mr Chong Kee Hiong and Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggest that the occupancy cap be calibrated according to the size of the residential unit; Er Dr Lee Bee Wah suggested that the flat cap of six tenants be now imposed on HDB flats, so that it is consistent between private and public housing. I think Mr Gan also suggested that.",
            "In HDB flats, there are predictable typologies of design and layout, and a simple set of rules can be based on the number of rooms. That is what we have today. Unlike HDB flats, private housing comes in wide-ranging varieties and configurations. It would be hard to formulate a rule that could capture all the variations along the scale of private residential housing, from shoebox flats to bungalows. We have considered this but we think that a complicated tiered cap may be confusing for the public, and may result in uncertainty for those who want to rent or sublet legitimately.",
            "In fact, the cap of six persons was the original cap that used to be in place before. But this cap was raised to eight in 2008 and it was due specifically to ease a crunch in the housing supply for workers. Since then, we have built up a good supply of alternative accommodation catering to groups other than families, such as hostels for students and dormitories for company employees and workers. So, we believe it is timely to revert to the cap of six, which was what it used to be before 2008.",
            "As for reviewing the HDB limits, I think that is a separate matter. It is not within the remit of the Planning Act because the HDB controls are regulated separately, but we would be happy to do the review of the occupancy cap for HDB flats on a separate basis.",
            "Finally, on the most interesting issue of this debate and the one which got most contributions from Members − on short-term accommodation. Let me address the queries and the points that have been raised by Members with regard to this particular issue.",
            "I must first clarify that the amendments in this Bill do not amount to a change of policy. There is already an existing URA guideline against any short-term accommodation of less than six months in private residences. A breach of these guidelines can be considered a material change of use, which will then be deemed an offence in the Planning Act. This remains the case under the amendments to the Act and the same penalties apply. So, we are not changing policy; we are taking the same approach.",
            "In fact, URA had undertaken public consultation on this matter of short-term accommodation in 2015, and in its focus group discussions with stakeholders such as Neighbourhood Committees and managing agents of private residential developments, there was also strong endorsement of the need to preserve the privacy and sanctity valued by the vast majority of homeowners.",
            "Likewise several Members just now − Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Ms Joan Pereria, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Alex Yam amongst others − shared their constituents' experiences and expressed strong support for these rules, and also, in fact, strong support for enforcement. I know Mr Louis Ng felt that this perhaps was done in haste, but I also heard Er Dr Lee Bee Wah who asked why we took so long to put this in place.",
            "On balance, we will have to enforce the current rules, which we have been doing and will continue to do.",
            "Indeed, over the past year, URA has already seen a 60% rise in complaints from homeowners about breaches of this short-term rule in their residential properties, and the complaints are related to public nuisance or even safety concerns for their families. These are issues that we take seriously and we should enforce the current rules, as we are already doing, and make sure that the issue does not worsen further. The amendments to the Act will enable URA to do so.",
            "In terms of enforcement, URA will continue with its current enforcement approach on errant homeowners, which means that when you look at advertising on home-sharing or rental websites, that in itself is not an offence and it is not regulated under the Planning Act, because these listings typically do not indicate the tenure of lease. On that basis of the listing on the site, it is not possible to take action. But as a first step, what URA will do is to work with the MCST of the development which have units with online listings and they will put up notifications to the residents in that development, so that the residents are aware of the rules on short-term accommodation. Then, if the short-term rentals persist and cause dis-amenities for other homeowners, URA will step in to enforce.",
            "I agree with Ms Joan Pereira that MCSTs can also do their part. Under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act or BMSMA, MCSTs have oversight of common property. For example, they can pass their own by-laws to manage the use and enjoyment of their common property through screening and record-keeping. They can also pass by-laws to register the details of all visitors. These are meaningful and practical things that MSCTs can do, and we will encourage them to do so and assist URA in its enforcement action.",
            "I should also clarify that the minimum period of six months for short-term rental in private residences is set out in the Schedule of the Act, and the Government can adjust this parameter in future by gazette. Indeed, in its earlier consultation, URA had received feedback from a number of respondents, including homeowners, that there was scope to reduce the minimum period of rental in a private residence. So, URA is studying this carefully, and will consider a possible reduction in the minimum rental time frame. This is the six-month time frame. URA will consider whether there can be scope to reduce this time frame.",
            "But whatever adjustments we may make to this minimum period, it is clear that it will not accommodate residential homes that are being put up for daily rental; meaning to say, even if we were to reduce from six months to three months, for example, this would not accommodate residential homes that are converted to daily rental of rooms which are operating very much more like hotels. In fact, such premises which are rented out on a daily basis, really ought to be regulated more like hotels rather than residential homes and they should be subjected to relevant licensing and conditions to ensure proper standards. That was also the feedback that URA had received from various stakeholders and we also note that many cities in Asia and around the world are likewise regulating short-term home-sharing platforms in a similar way to hotels and service apartments. So, in response to the point made by Mr Louis Ng, we had indeed studied the models used by other cities. Indeed, for many of them, where it comes to short-term stays that are operating very much more like daily rentals like the way a hotel or a service apartment would, the city municipal governments are taking actions and regulating them like hotels or service apartments.",
            "In this regard, I am happy to share that URA is studying the option of creating a new use class for private residences that wish to engage in short-term rentals. Such properties would then be approved for that specific purpose, like service apartments or hotels today. New residential sites can be sold with such an approved use, allowing flexibility for short-term rentals. For existing residential buildings, they would then require planning permission for change of use, and this would be subject to a set of guidelines which URA is looking into.",
            "What I have just described just now, these proposed measures, are separate from the amendments that are being tabled today. What I have described just now with this option of creating a new use class for private residences to engage in short-term rentals, can be done without changes to the Act. So, these are separate from the amendments. URA is studying them, and they will provide more details soon for further engagement and consultation with the stakeholders.",
            "I shared what we are thinking about because there is obviously strong interest from Members, and I thought I should clarify our approach and current thinking on this matter, and also explain that we do see a role for home-sharing platforms to continue operating in Singapore so long as they are properly regulated and so long as there is a level playing field between them and similar entities that provide short-term rentals like hotels and service apartments.",
            "I agree that the sharing economy is here to stay; this is a point that several Members had said. We will allow a space in our city for such platforms to exist.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe I have addressed the points raised by Members, and I thank them for their contributions and support of the Bill. The amendments in this Bill will strengthen URA's ability to safeguard and enhance the vibrancy and liveability of our urban space. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move."

            ":Mr Deputy Speaker, as the sun sets outside this House, it seems timely that we consider the night, the colour of the night and how we light the night.",
            "Over the past 10 years, we have seen improvements in lighting technology. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have become more prevalent on the commercial market and have transformed the market for lighting. The lifespan of an LED is longer than that of a traditional incandescent light bulb. LEDs give out less heat, important in a tropical country like Singapore. LEDs generally are more energy-efficient than other types of light bulbs or even fluorescent lamps, and their energy efficiency is getting better year-by-year. They are an example of how science and technology are improving people's lives − new solutions to old problems.",
            "Today, there are many different types of LED lights, each with slightly different shades of colour, even different shades of white. To describe the shades of white, the experts use the phrase \"colour temperature\". This is not the temperature of the light bulb, but − if I may use the language of scientists − it is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator giving out light of comparable colour to the light source. What does that mean? You might call it the colour of \"red-hot\", of \"yellow-hot\", or \"white-hot\". Even if the LED light itself does not give out much heat. So, we have some LEDs which give out a yellowish, warmer, more natural-looking white. Colour temperature around 3,000 Kelvins. Some have a harsher white colour, with a little bit of blue light as well. Colour temperature closer to 4,500 Kelvins or more.",
            "Over the years, it has become easier for us to light up the night but this has also brought to light new challenges as well. For example, Mr Deputy Speaker, exposure to light has been reported to suppress the production of melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone produced by the body that influences the body's own biological rhythms − what we call the circadian rhythms that tell our bodies when we feel sleepy, and when we feel awake.",
            "While any kind of visible light can suppress the production of melatonin, we know from research at Harvard University that blue light, in particular, has a stronger effect than other kinds of light. For example, blue light suppresses the production of melatonin for about twice as long as green light of comparable brightness. It shifts the circadian rhythm − the sleeping, waking rhythm − by three hours instead of just one-and-a-half hours. Some researchers have even raised concerns about whether shifting this circadian rhythm can affect eating habits, and in turn the risk of obesity and diabetes. The research is on-going but questions like these are being talked about. We also know that modern fluorescent lights and LEDs produce more blue light than traditional light bulbs. So, this is a growing issue.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, what have other countries, other jurisdictions tried to do about these questions? If we look at the USA and Europe, increasingly there are policy suggestions proposing that the colour of light is important, especially at night. In Switzerland, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) recommends that LED lamps should have less blue-light component. The American Medical Association has also called for a reduction in the amount of blue-light component in LED lights. The Harvard Medical School, in their Harvard Health Letter, has pointed out that having too much blue light at night may not be optimal for health. I am grateful to experts such as Prof Michael Chee from the Duke-NUS Medical School for highlighting some of these pointers.",
            "Even in the commercial sector, even among the companies that build your portable devices, even the Apple iPhone has a \"night mode\" where the colour of the display shifts to a more yellow shade of white, with less blue light emitted.",
            "So, why is this important to Singapore? This is because in our built-up housing estates, the colour of night is shaded by what kind of lighting we choose. Corridor light in our housing estates and in our void decks can shine into living rooms and bedrooms. It is not a short exposure. At the same time, it is also important that our housing estates are energy efficient. And our housing estates must also at the same time be brightly lit enough so that all residents, especially our vulnerable and elderly, are able to move about safely at night.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, I am told by HDB colleagues that, for health and safety of lights, HDB relies upon the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard called IEC 62471. Currently, both the pure white-light and warmer yellow-white-light LEDs would satisfy this IEC criteria. But at the same time, given the discussions going on in America and Europe, it is quite possible that the consensus may be shifting in favour of warm yellow-white LED lights, lights which are less pure white but have a warmer yellow-white colour.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, even if the consensus does not shift for a few more years, it would be prudent of us to consider possible future developments in the industry, future shifts in the consensus because, an LED lamp once installed, is an investment that will be around for many years − long enough to possibly become obsolete if international safety standards shift. And even if we leave aside the discussion about health implications, there is something to be said for having the night-time lighting look just that little bit more natural − a more yellow shade of white, a city at night that looks warmer and more natural.",
            "So, Mr Deputy Speaker, I call upon MND and HDB to look at this issue, to consider standardising, consider moving towards LEDs which give out less blue light. We can do this by choosing LED lights with a bit more of a natural yellow colour − a \"warm white\" colour. To ensure that our living environment is still bright enough for the elderly, HDB could also study the perceived brightness of different types of LEDs. What kind of power output is needed for a pure white LED to look as bright as a warm yellow LED − how to calibrate this, how to have these standards. And once these standards have been studied by HDB, they could be shared with other agencies as well as the private sector. And I wonder if HDB's Building & Research Institute could help look into this.",
            "We should also encourage LTA to think about having less blue light, when illuminating our roads at night. Safety on the road is important. It is important that road users can see each other, can see pedestrians, can stay out of danger. But within these limitations, we should look at how to reduce the amount of blue light given out by LED lights.",
            "With LTA's plans to replace all street lamps with LED lights by 2022, we are at an inflection point in our national lighting infrastructure. It is not too early for us to be thinking about these questions. And in our MOE schools as well, there may be a role for looking at warm yellow-white LEDs, when replacing the older fluorescent light tubes.",
            "And Deputy Speaker, all these could be part of a shared design language. A shared design language that shapes the aesthetics of our housing estates and our shared spaces throughout our little red dot.",
            "Deputy Speaker, as a little red dot on the Equator, we have 12 hours of daylight each day. The rest is night − one half of our existence. So, it matters how we light the night. The colour of night matters, and there is emerging evidence that by choosing a better way to colour the night, we can reduce the risk of casting a shadow on our sleep and our health.",
            "May we always choose well, and always seek the right kind of illumination."

            ":Deputy Speaker, I agree with Dr Tan Wu Meng that night lighting has an impact on the everyday lives of Singaporeans. Our lighting must, first, be functional − from drivers on our expressways to passers-by along our HDB estate corridors, night lighting must be calibrated to suit their different needs. Second, it must be aesthetically pleasing. It should positively shape how we perceive and interact with our estates and public spaces. And, third, it has to be safe. This is important, given how pervasive night lighting is in a dense built-up city like Singapore.",
            "To achieve this, one of the specifications we take into account is the light colour. And those of you who have bought fluorescent or LED lights will know that they generally come in three colours, as Dr Tan had described − warm white, pure white and cool white.",
            "Warm white has the least amount of blue-light, giving it a yellow hue and a colour temperature of about 3,000 Kelvin. Pure white has a more balanced mix of blue-light, giving it a natural daylight feel and a colour temperature of around 4,000 Kelvin; while cool white has the highest amount of blue-light, resulting in a harsh white colour and a colour temperature of around 6,000 Kelvin.",
            "Light colour is important for both functionality and aesthetics. For our street lighting, LTA is moving towards pure white because it offers drivers a high colour contrast, allowing them to see better at night.",
            "In our new HDB developments, light fittings at common areas, such as corridors, also use pure white − but for a different reason. The previous feedback garnered from residents indicated that warm white was too dim for HDB estates. Light colour can affect safety, too, as Dr Tan rightly pointed out. I have explained how LTA uses light colour to improve road safety at night, for drivers and pedestrians.",
            "Dr Tan has cited several reports which advise minimising the amount of blue-light for health reasons. Based on these reports, he has suggested we use warm white in our HDB common areas and LTA street lighting. These reports make two broad points. First, they state that long-term or high intensity exposure to blue-light can damage the retina of the human eye. Second, they highlight that exposure to any light at night − especially blue-light − can affect our sleep cycles by suppressing the production of a hormone called melatonin, and affect our circadian rhythm or body clock. This has been linked to impaired daytime functioning and obesity.",
            "I would like to clarify that care has been taken by agencies to ensure that the lighting installed in public places do not cause harm to the human eye. So, the first point about potential damage to the retina of the human eye is not a significant concern in Singapore, given our regulations.",
            "Lighting in our HDB common areas and LTA street lighting follow the globally-recognised International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards, which Dr Tan had articulated earlier. These spell out technical and safety requirements for lighting, including the safety limits for exposure to white light. Indeed, the same report by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health states that \"commercial LED lamps represent no health risk when used correctly\" − in terms of the risk to human retina.",
            "On the second point on the impact of blue-light on melatonin and our sleep cycles, as Dr Tan pointed out, there is no medical consensus on the issue as yet. The reports do not rule out the use of pure white lighting in street lighting or in public spaces like HDB common areas.",
            "And the specific implications of the reports' findings on our HDB common areas and LTA street lighting are as yet unclear. For example, the Harvard Medical School's Harvard Health Letter is based on studies which exposed people to blue-light for six and a half hours or longer, while the exposure of most Singaporeans to HDB corridors and street lighting by LTA is much shorter.",
            "Apart from changing the colour of all our lighting, there may be other ways to address this issue. Indeed, one of the possible solutions mentioned by the American Medical Association is dimming LED lighting during off-peak periods. We have, in fact, already installed LED lighting with motion sensors along staircases for all BTO projects launched since 2014, and we are testing out sensor-controlled smart lighting in the common areas of Punggol Northshore estate. Not only will this make our HDB estates more energy-efficient, it would also minimise ambient blue-light at night.",
            "Ultimately, we must ensure that our lighting remains functional, aesthetically-pleasing and safe. The light colours of HDB common areas and LTA street lamps are carefully selected to meet the functional, safety and aesthetic needs of Singaporeans. We should only decide how best to enhance our lighting after further study on the appropriate length and intensity of blue-light exposure at night has been done.",
            "This, notwithstanding, I agree with Dr Tan that it is not too early for us to be thinking about the long-term implications of these reports on the health and safety of Singaporeans. We will, therefore, continue to keep a close watch on the evolving research on this area.",
            "HDB will also take up Dr Tan's suggestion to study how to vary lighting levels (or luminescence) based on different colours of LED lights. This will allow us to better decide on the appropriate light colours in different settings − be it for functional or aesthetic reasons.",
            "On its part, LTA will continue to use pure white lighting for expressways and major arterial roads for road safety reasons, because of the greater colour contrast. In the meantime, because street lamps use high intensity lighting, LTA will study whether it is feasible to use warm white lighting for street lamps on minor roads, especially those located in residential estates.",
            "Deputy Speaker, the scientific research into lighting is evolving, and new lighting solutions will come on the market. We will continue to take steps to find better ways to colour the night, to keep our city vibrant and safe.",

Even as we implement Healthcare 2020, we need to plan ahead further into the future. Last year, I announced three key shifts to prepare for our healthcare needs beyond 2020: beyond hospital to community, beyond quality to value and beyond healthcare to health. This transformation is necessary as our healthcare needs will grow in volume and complexity due to our ageing population and increased chronic disease burden, among others. For this reason, we need to organise ourselves better so that we can implement the transformation more swiftly and decisively.",
            "The public healthcare system will be reorganised into three integrated clusters, each having a fuller range of facilities, capabilities, services and networks across different care settings. This will enable them to deliver more comprehensive and person-centred health promotion, disease prevention, curative and rehabilitative care for the population in their respective regions.",
            "Primary care will play an increasingly important role in our care transformation. After reorganisation, each cluster will have a group of polyclinics which, together with General Practitioner partners and community partners, can anchor care more firmly in primary and community settings. Collectively, these changes will ultimately benefit Singaporeans by providing more appropriate care and bringing care closer to them.",
            "In addition to greater economies of scale, the reorganisation will also facilitate scaling up of programmes and services by the integrated clusters, and their collaborations with the private sector and community partners, across a wider region to benefit more Singaporeans.",
            "The integrated clusters will be able to tap on a larger pool of manpower resources and talents. They will also be able to offer their employees a wider and deeper range of professional development opportunities, and a broader platform for cross-learning that will benefit staff and our patients.",
            "We do not expect to incur significant financial cost for the reorganisation. The planned infrastructure and service developments are already included in our Healthcare 2020 Master Plan and the three key shifts I highlighted and they are separately catered for in our healthcare budget. These will need to be implemented regardless of the reorganisation."

On balance, we are not ready to legislate eldercare leave at this time, as we need to strike a balance between employers' concerns on business costs and manpower constraints, and the employability of caregivers, versus the need for additional leave provision for eldercare purposes. There are existing leave provisions that can be used for this purpose.",

In relation to that, we encourage companies to provide more family-related leave benefits which can be used for different purposes, as well as flexible work arrangements. We track this provision and the trends have been encouraging thus far.",
            "Sixty-seven percent of employees work in companies that offer at least one formal flexible work arrangement last year, up from 56% in 2011. Close to eight in 10 employers also provide unplanned time-off or ad-hoc teleworking for their employees to attend to personal matters.",

OCBC offers two days of family care to employees who are not entitled to childcare leave. Cerebos Pacific Limited, a manufacturing company, also offers family care leave on top of statutory leave.",

In particular, lifts are procured through open tenders, and the evaluation process factors in quality and reliability of lift contractors. Audits, stress-tests and inspections in the presence of an independent Authorised Examiner (AE) are also conducted as part of a well-established lift commissioning process.",
            "Sigma has been installing lifts in HDB estates for the past 10 years, and has generally met the prescribed performance standards. However, for a recent batch contract awarded to Sigma in 2013, Sigma was unable to meet the timeline for lift installation. Hence in late 2015, HDB restricted Sigma from tendering for new HDB lift contracts, to ensure that Sigma dedicated its resources to fulfil its contractual obligations. HDB also observed a higher-than-usual breakdown and fault rate in lifts from this batch contract in their first year of operations. The tender restriction has therefore not been lifted, and will continue until performance standards improve.",
            "HDB's investigations revealed that while the design and installation of the affected lifts complied with prevailing codes and standards, the doors and sensors were more susceptible to misalignment from knocks. This, coupled with frequent heavy and rough lift usage during the first year period due to renovation and moving activities, resulted in the higher lift faults.",
            "HDB has instructed Sigma to rectify these issues and to carry out improvement works to ensure that the lift doors and sensors operate smoothly. HDB has also issued stern warnings to Sigma, and is closely monitoring the performance of its lifts.",

In particular, Sigma has undertaken the rectification works progressively, and the performance of the lifts has improved.

            ": From 2012 to 2016, the Police investigated an annual average of 325 cases of serious sexual crimes involving victims below the age of 16. Sexual penetration of minor made up the majority of serious sexual crimes, accounting for about 230 cases a year on average. This is followed by about 75 cases of rape a year and 20 cases of sexual assault by penetration a year.",
            "Over the same period, the Police also investigated about 290 cases of outrage of modesty and 45 cases of sexual exploitation and sexual grooming per year. The trend for sexual crimes involving victims below 16 years of age has been stable over the past five years.",
            "We take a serious view of sexual crimes, in particular when the victims are minors. To tackle these offences, we adopt a four-pronged approach.",
            "Firstly, the Penal Code imposes stiff penalties for serious sexual offences. For instance, rape is punishable with an imprisonment term of up to 20 years and also liable to caning. If the rape involved a minor under the age of 14 without consent, the enhanced punishment is an imprisonment term of not less than eight years and up to 20 years with minimum 12 strokes of caning. We have also created specific offences targeting those who take advantage of the vulnerable, such as sexual grooming of minors.",
            "Secondly, we enforce these laws firmly. Police take all allegations of sexual offences seriously. Sexual crimes are investigated by specialist units in the Police Divisions and the Criminal Investigation Department. The investigation officers in these units are trained to handle sexual crime investigations, as well as to manage sexual crime victims, including minors, with appropriate sensitivity.",
            "Thirdly, we take a robust approach towards rehabilitation and reintegration of sex offenders, so as to reduce reoffending. For less serious offences, the court may make mandatory treatment orders requiring the sex offender to undergo psychiatric treatment. Sex offenders who are imprisoned for more serious offences are put through the sex offender treatment programme administered by the Singapore Prison Service, which seeks to reduce reoffending by enhancing self-management of sex offending behaviour.",
            "Fourthly, the Police also work with relevant agencies to put in place proactive safeguards. These include conducting talks in MOE schools to educate students on precautions to protect themselves from sexual assault, and to raise awareness of the legal and social consequences of teenage sex. The Police also train teachers and school counsellors to recognise and report tell-tale signs of sexual assault or abuse in students.",
            "The Member asked about plans to create a sex offender registry with limited access given to agencies. The Registration of Criminal Act allows the Police to maintain a non-public record of persons convicted of serious offences, including sexual offences. Agencies such as MOE and MSF work closely with the Police to screen prospective employees who are applying for jobs involving children. For example, MOE screens prospective employees for child care centres, kindergartens and schools with the Police. These processes ensure that persons who have committed serious sexual crimes are not employed in sensitive positions which may put children at risk, but without publicly listing sex offenders which will add to the stigmatisation of these offenders and hinder rehabilitation and reintegration efforts."

            "Adoption Leave – like Maternity and Paternity Leave – is intended to support parents of infants in their first year after delivery, when infants are more vulnerable and need more care. Hence, usage of the leave is limited to the child’s first year of age. Beyond the child’s infancy, all working parents, including adoptive parents, can take six days of paid childcare leave each per year until the child turns seven years old, and two days each per year when their children are between the ages of seven and 12 years. In addition, parents are eligible for six days of unpaid infantcare leave per parent each year, during the child’s first two years.",
            "Employers have provided feedback that even if the overall duration of leave provisions remains unchanged, extending their coverage (for example, beyond the first year of the child’s life), or allowing even more flexibility in sharing the leave between parents, could have an impact on manpower and administrative costs, especially in a time of business uncertainties. We need to balance between providing support for employees with caregiving needs, and employers' concerns on business costs and manpower constraints, as well as the employability of caregivers. Given the significant enhancements made recently, we will not be adjusting the Adoption Leave provisions further, at this point of time.",
            "It will be more important and sustainable for employers to provide a family-friendly work environment, such as by having flexible work arrangements in place, and for our wider community to create a more family-friendly environment in Singapore. Employers can tap on various resources to implement flexible work arrangements, including the WorkPro Work-Life Grant from the Ministry of Manpower and the Tripartite Advisory on Flexible Work Arrangements published by the tripartite partners."

In such instances, repeated rounds of fogging may be necessary while concurrent efforts are made to remove the breeding habitats.",

NEA does not impose any cap on the number of fogging operations that can be carried out in a particular location as such operations need to be calibrated according to the ground conditions such as the mosquito population which could be fairly dynamic in nature. If there are excessive fogging operations, NEA would engage the premises managers and the PCOs to adjust the fogging operations.",

According to CASE, consumers who have prepayments with CaseTrust accredited businesses that offer prepayment protection to consumers, have not suffered monetary losses due to business closures in 2016. We encourage more businesses to be CaseTrust accredited, and to go further by providing prepayment protection if they collect advance payments from consumers. It is also important for consumers to be aware of the possible risks involved in making prepayments, and their capacity to bear with possible losses before taking up a prepaid package.",

Such measures raise the cost of doing business which would be passed on to consumers. Overseas jurisdictions, including those in the European Union, Australia and Hong Kong, also recognise the challenges and do not impose broad-based prepayment protection measures. Businesses which engage in unfair practices when selling prepaid packages will be investigated by SPRING Singapore as the administering agency for the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act."

A key benefit of this market-based approach is that it provides parents with a diverse range of programmes to choose from, so as to best cater to their preferences and the different needs of their young children.",
            "That said, given the large number of operators participating in this sector, it is not surprising that fees, resources and quality will vary across pre-schools. A nationalised system has the potential to provide more consistent quality and affordability, but this system may not cater to the preferences of every parent.",
            "Internationally, countries have adopted different approaches to early childhood care and education depending on their specific contexts. While some jurisdictions have a state-run preschool system, places such as Hong Kong and Australia adopt a similar approach as ours where private operators and the community play a significant role prior to formal primary education.",

Hence, our priority now is to work together to raise the accessibility, affordability and quality of pre-school.",

We are piloting a few MOE Kindergartens as an added quality and affordable option in the landscape.

This complements other efforts to raise the quality of pre-school education in the sector, such as strengthening teacher training and developing a kindergarten curriculum for the sector.",

            ": ElderShield is an insurance scheme that provides basic protection against the costs of long-term care arising from severe disability in old age. Premiums for policyholders are collected annually between age 40 and 65. Coverage starts at age 40 and the policyholder is covered for life. If a policyholder becomes severely disabled before age 65, he will no longer need to pay further premiums and will start to receive monthly ElderShield payouts. From 2002 to end-2015, about $2.6 billion have been collected in premiums and around $100 million have been paid out in claims. About $130 million in premium rebates have been given to policyholders so far, the first tranche in 2007 and another in 2012.",
            "The oldest ElderShield cohort that enrolled at age 40 in 2002 will be turning 55 this year. The current age profile of policyholders is relatively young but will get older over time. As older people are more likely to become severely disabled compared to younger people, ElderShield payouts are expected to increase when the profile of policyholders gets older. Indeed, the proportion of claims over premiums collected has been increasing since ElderShield started in 2002, and this trend will continue in the future.",
            "People who are not familiar with how ElderShield works may ask why the current amount of premiums collected is much higher than the amount of claims paid out so far. Some may even wrongly conclude that policyholders have been paying too much in premiums or that insurers have made excessive profits. Allow me to clarify the facts to address these misperceptions.",
            "There are insurance schemes that provide coverage for the year in which the policyholder pays his premiums – when the policyholder stops paying premiums, the coverage ends. ElderShield works differently. It collects premiums while the policyholder is aged 40 to 65, and provides lifetime coverage from age 40, even after the policyholder reaches 65 and stops paying premiums.",
            "Hence, it is prudent for the total amount of premiums collected to exceed the amount of claims paid while our policyholders are still young, because the premiums collected are meant to provide coverage against future claims throughout the policyholder's lifetime. As explained earlier, the proportion of claims over premiums collected has been increasing since 2002 and we can expect this trend to continue as the profile of our policyholders gets older over time. If the insurers do not collect enough premiums today and set aside some amounts for future claims, there is a risk that ElderShield will not be able to provide adequate coverage for policyholders as our population ages. It is important for insurers to ensure that policyholders will not face this situation."

We do not subsidise electricity generation or consumption. The fuel mix is also varied among OECD countries with some having access to coal, nuclear energy, and renewables like hydropower. In contrast, 95% of electricity generation in Singapore uses natural gas imported at global prices.

            "The remaining 26% of heavy vehicle parking spaces is managed by URA and HDB in the form of temporary heavy vehicle parks located within or at the fringes of residential areas. Over time, these temporary heavy vehicle parks will be progressively phased out, partly to make way for new developments, and partly because having heavy vehicles enter densely populated heartland precincts poses a safety risk, especially to the elderly and young children. To facilitate this transition, agencies are incorporating new heavy vehicle parks within industrial developments that are near to residential areas, where feasible.",
            "Ultimately, it is the responsibility of business owners to provide or secure parking for the vehicles that they own, and to provide their drivers with the appropriate transport options to get to their vehicles for work. This is especially so if they require their drivers work during odd hours.",
            "Commercial vehicles, such as vans and light goods vehicles, with unladen weight exceeding 1,800 kg, are generally not allowed to park in HDB residential car parks for safety and environmental reasons.",
            "However, HDB does exercise flexibility by allowing them to use the residential car parks if the vehicles can fit within a standard car lot, and do not obstruct or endanger other car park users. Such vehicles should, however, not exceed an unladen weight of 2,000 kg if they intend to park within HDB multi-storey car parks (MSCP) as the MSCPs are not designed to withstand vehicular weights beyond this limit. Those that exceed an unladen weight of 2,000 kg can park in HDB surface residential car parks. They can also park at commercial and industrial car parks, as well as heavy vehicle parks."

According to our survey on retrenchment benefits in 2015, it was not a widespread practice for employers to specify the quantum of retrenchment benefits in their employment contracts, except for the unionised sector where a majority of the collective agreements specify the quantum of retrenchment benefits. These establishments were mainly from manufacturing, construction and wholesale and retail trade. The same survey also found that around 90% of establishments which retrenched workers in 2015 paid retrenchment benefits to eligible workers.",
            "The tripartite partners have deliberated extensively on whether to make retrenchment benefits mandatory, and to specify the minimum quantum in the Employment Act. We have concluded that it may not necessarily be beneficial for both workers and businesses. A mandated level of minimum retrenchment benefit will likely become the norm, and would not benefit the workers in cases where the employers are able to pay higher amounts. If we set the quantum too high, companies may not be able to afford it, especially when they are downsizing under difficult conditions. Further, overburdening companies will also have a negative impact on the remaining workers in the company as they strive to restructure and turn around the business. Instead, the tripartite partners issue guidelines which stipulate the prevailing norms for retrenchment benefits quantum. These norms can be updated from time to time.",
