            ": In 2015, the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) commenced a study on the factors affecting the movement of petrol prices in Singapore since 2010. CCS found that the petrol companies use Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) prices, not crude oil prices, in their cost accounting and pricing decisions for retail petrol. Crude oil price is the price of unrefined oil while MOPS price is the price at which petrol companies purchase refined wholesale petrol from the refineries. MOPS price tends to be higher than crude oil price as it includes the cost of refining crude oil into wholesale petrol.",
            "In 2015, MOPS price made up less than one-third of the listed retail petrol price. Other components of retail petrol price include operating costs, taxes and duties, land costs, discounts and rebates. These non-fuel components have generally increased in the past few years.",
            "The retail petrol price that consumers generally pay includes the petrol levy as well as discounts and rebates. Consumers enjoyed an average of about 18% in discounts and rebates off the listed price for Octane 95 petrol in 2014 through site discounts, loyalty programmes and credit card payment.",
            "Between June 2014 and January 2016, crude oil price fell by an average of S$0.59, MOPS price fell by S$0.52 and the listed price for Octane 95 petrol fell by S$0.35. The pass-through, while relatively high at around 70%, is not complete because of the non-fuel components which make up more than two-thirds of listed retail petrol price. After taking into account the discounts and rebates that consumers enjoy and the levy increase in February 2015, the effective price that consumers paid for Octane 95 petrol fell by S$0.45, implying a pass-through of over 85%.",
            "Over the six-year period between 1 January 2010 and 31 January 2016, CCS observed that the listed prices for Octane 95 petrol moved in tandem with MOPS prices. There was no significant variation between the time taken to either raise or lower the listed prices for Octane 95 petrol in response to changes in MOPS prices. The magnitude of the change in listed prices for Octane 95 petrol relative to the change of MOPS prices was also observed to be the same whether MOPS prices increased or decreased.",
            "Based on the information gathered, there is no evidence, Mdm Speaker, to suggest collusion in retail petrol pricing, even though petrol companies do monitor and react to each other's published prices. CCS will continue to monitor developments in the retail petrol market."

            ": Thank you, Mdm Speaker, and I thank the Minister of State for the answer. We are not saying that they are colluding but we are not happy with the amount of the reduction in the petrol price. I would like to ask the Minister of State: did the Ministry study the price of petrol during the last cycle of upward trend of crude oil and how fast the petrol companies increased the petrol price.",
            "The next question: could it be that there is a lack of competition in Singapore – there are just a few of them. Can the Ministry consider removing the three-quarter tank rule?"

            ": Mdm Speaker, between June 2014 and January 2016, MOPS price fell by S$0.52, or 53%, as I had said earlier, while the listed price of Octane 95 fell by S$0.35, which is about 15%. The smaller percentage drop largely reflects the fact that MOPS price made up only of a third of the listed retail price. So, a third of S$0.52 would be a ballpark of about 15%. The lack of complete pass-through could also be due to changes in non-fuel components, as I had listed earlier.",
            "As to whether we will be studying this further, yes, CCS will continue to monitor and will continue to study. We will be embarking on a study on the supply side of the equation to see if consumer behaviour does affect pricing from the petrol companies."

            ": I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive reply. Comprehensive Commission of Singapore (CCS) said that MOPS price makes up about one third of the listed retail petrol price. When we look at the average MOPS price of Octane 95 last week , it was about US$46.5 per barrel. Three times of that average MOPS price is about US$139.5 per barrel.",
            "When we look at the retail price of Octane 95 in Singapore at the petrol kiosks, it costs about S$1.82 per litre before discount. Even if we are given a discount of 15% on average, it costs about S$1.55 per litre or US$174.64 per barrel, as compared to three times the MOPS price which is equivalent to US$139.5 per barrel. That is, the retail price of Octane 95 is US$35.14 higher than US$139.50, or 25% more. It appears that the petrol companies are charging Singaporeans at least 25% more. A lot of Singaporeans are looking towards MTI to help us to regulate retail petrol prices, so that we are not over-charged. I hope the Minister of State can look into it."

          "content": [
            ": Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. Let me just go through what exactly is the difference between listed prices and effective prices. Listed prices are prices that are observed at petrol stations, for example, those that are displayed at the pumps. Effective prices are listed prices that exclude the levy hike introduced in February 2015, but have factored in the discounts and the rebates that are enjoyed by the consumers. The price that consumers pay will be the listed prices minus the discounts and the rebates.",
            "The question of whether the petrol companies' prices will go up and how much the increase in petrol prices are affecting the operating income of the companies, for example, in terms of the profit margins that the Member was alluding to, on average, on a per litre basis, the operating income of petrol companies has generally increased over the past few years, but the increase is smaller relative to the increase in the non-fuel components that the companies have to shoulder.",
            "Unfortunately, CCS is unable to provide further details about the change in the operating income at the company level, as such information is deemed to be commercially sensitive. As to whether the companies are profiteering, on average, the operating income of petrol companies has generally increased over the past years.",
            "As I have said earlier, this increase is smaller relative to the increase in the non-fuel components such as operating costs, taxes and duties, land cost, discounts and rebates. An increase in profit, in itself, is not a contravention of the Competition Act, unless the increase is due to market players engaging in anti-competitive behaviours which would contravene the Competition Act. Based on information that CCS has gathered in the market study, there is no evidence to suggest whether there is any collusion in petrol pricing even though they do monitor the prices.",
            "Consumers, generally, as the Member pointed out, do enjoy discounts and rebates off the petrol prices. In 2014, consumers enjoyed an average of about 18% discounts and rebates off the retail petrol prices for Octane 95. The discounts and rebates, especially for credit cards, are quite variable and are not easily comparable due to varying terms and conditions."

            ": Mdm Speaker, may I ask the Minister of State whether MTI would consider publishing petrol prices, both retail and crude oil prices, and make them readily available to the public so that members of the public can see how the prices move. The Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) did a study recently and realised that despite crude oil prices coming down, the price of Octane 98 went up by S$0.02. Clearly, there is some issue of education.",
            "The other question that I wish to ask the Minister of State is whether MTI would consider encouraging a third party, for example, the cooperatives under NTUC, to run another petrol company, so that we would have greater competition. This is very much like what IDA did to introduce to introduce a fourth telco to provide greater competition, so that our consumers have greater choices."

            ": Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. There is currently no legal requirement for petrol companies to display their pump prices prominently. CCS notes that the reason why petrol companies do not display their prices prominently is because in certain jurisdictions overseas, petrol companies are accused of anti-competitive price signalling when they do so, when it is not legally required to do so in the first place.",
            "That said, CCS recognises that improved price transparency in the retail petrol market may facilitate easier comparison and more informed petrol buying decisions by consumers. CCS will be conducting a customer survey on petrol demand in Singapore to understand consumer choices and their switching behaviour on petrol purchases, in particular, whether improving price transparency will facilitate a more competitive market.",
            "As to whether we should be having another petrol player the in the market, that will be a commercial decision that NTUC has to take. I am not sure whether NTUC is contemplating this in the first place."

As far as the pricing of petrol is concerned for which the key variation in response to market crude oil prices is the MOPS pricing, that has been consistent with all the other companies. MOPS pricing was also used as an international standard in pricing for petrol sale across jurisdictions, so I think that is a fair method for pricing crude oil and how retail petrol is being used in Singapore."

            ": Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Two clarifications. First, I think there are two ways of addressing this issue. One is to regulate more and look more closely. The second is actually to open up competition, and I actually would prefer the second approach. One way of doing this will be as the Minister of State had mentioned – to have more price transparency. In doing that, I would also suggest that any discounts and so on be factored in; otherwise, it is very difficult for customers to track what a 10% or 15% discount on this price is.",
            "Secondly, and this I echo my colleague, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's suggestion to review the three-quarter tank rule, because sometimes the best way to raise competition may be to open the market up and to allow those more price sensitive customers to go overseas and top up their petrol."

            ": Mdm Speaker, I just want to clarify with regard to actual petrol pricing, MOPS is a recognised international standard of pricing based on actual international trades from Singapore. The MOPS price is a price on which oil is traded in Singapore and the region. MOPS prices are also used in the region as a price benchmark to make an assessment of the financial value of oils, which are transferred from upstream production to refineries and subsequently to the market.",
            "For example, Australia imports wholesale petrol from Singapore based on MOPS price which is a key pricing benchmark. So, in terms of pricing of petrol, how the price varies with crude oil changes, I think that has been used as a consistent and fair international benchmark.",

What he explained on MOPS pricing, we do not understand, but if we could take a look at the upward trend of the crude oil in the last round and how fast the petrol companies increased their price? So, could you study this?",

On average, there was no significance between the prices whether it was on the rise or on the decline. So, on a day-to-day basis, the level of pass-through and time taken for adjustments may deviate due to fluctuations in the fuel and non-fuel components but on the whole, the fluctuations do reflect the changes in the petrol pricing.",

          "speaker": "Mr Khaw Boon Wan",
          "content": [
            ": Mdm Speaker, the Cross Island Line (CRL) will be an important part of our future MRT network. It will link east to west, from Changi to Jurong, covering more than 50 km with about 30 stations. The exact alignment is being studied. Our preliminary estimate is that commuters from residential areas like Loyang, Pasir Ris, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio, Sin Ming, Bukit Timah, Clementi and West Coast will make at least 600,000 trips on the CRL every day. This will place the CRL higher, in terms of capacity and usage, compared, for example, to the North East Line (NEL). The CRL will also significantly enhance our network resilience as commuters will have many more routing options with the CRL connecting to other lines.",
            "What this means is that – nearly half of the 30-plus new stations will be interchange stations and that means that every other station will be an exchange station where you can switch to another line. This will significantly enhance the resilience of our network.",
            "Now, specific to the question raised by the Member, the Government is studying two possible alignments for the CRL in the vicinity of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR). Both options are underground, and construction of the tunnels for this stretch of the CRL will be carried out using bored tunnelling, instead of the cut-and-cover approach. Cut-and-cover means you cut through like a huge bulldozer and chop down whatever is in between, then you build the tunnel and you cover it up. With bored tunnelling, you avoid all the trauma and damages above the tunnel.",
            "For the 4-km direct alignment option, 2 km will be deep below the CCNR. How deep is deep? About 40 m – or 12 storeys – below ground level. And more importantly, at that level, this is what geologists call the hard bedrock level. In our case, this is the Bukit Timah granite. At this level, there are no vegetation, no trees, no animals. Under this option, there will not be any construction of infrastructure at surface level within the CCNR.",
            "The skirting alignment option, on the other hand, is about 9 km long. Because it is 9 km long, it will require longer tunnels. And therefore, it will require ventilation shafts and facilities on the surface; whereas in the earlier option, because it is short enough, you do not have to build all those quite ugly exhaust ducts which you see at some of our road junctions.",
            "This option could incur around $2 billion – $2,000 million – more in expenditure and could result in land acquisitions. The Member suggested that the skirting alignment could potentially serve more residents. However, the catchment there is already served by the Circle Line and the upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line.",
            "The CRL is a massive project and the Government will decide on its entire alignment only after making a total assessment including financial viability, technical feasibility and other relevant considerations. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is only one of the many studies which we need to undertake to help us determine the best alignment for the stretch of the CRL in the vicinity of the CCNR. Later, my MND colleague will provide some details on the EIA and also describe how the Government agencies are working closely with the nature groups on the EIA. It has been a very productive collaboration, although much remains to be done.",
            "As the alignments can have different impact on the environment, commuters, taxpayers, businesses and home owners, the Government has a responsibility to study both options thoroughly. Besides the EIA, there are upcoming technical site investigation works which will allow us to determine the soil profile and condition. This will feed into the Engineering Feasibility study. Only after all these environmental and technical studies on both possible alignments have been completed, and taking into account the potential impact on the nature reserve, the travelling distance and time for commuters, the cost to taxpayers, and the potential acquisition of homes and businesses, will we be able to make an informed decision on the project and its exact alignment. There will be many more public consultations so that we can adequately factor in all views. All these studies and consultations may take two more years to complete.",
            "Meanwhile, the EIA Phase 1 report is available online."

            ": I thank the Minister for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. One, could the Minister clarify what is the total cost for the construction of the CRL and what percentage increase that is of the total construction cost if we use the skirting alignment?",

            ": Madam, a short answer to both questions is: I do not know yet. As I have said, this is a massive project and usually, it would take easily four to five years for all the important studies to be made. In fact, although the EIA is published now, this is a product of two years of discussions and consultations. In this particular instance, it is because of the interest of nature groups and the sensitivity of the possible impact of any work of this part of the CRL on the nature reserve that the issue now surfaces.",
            "For the next leg of the studies, if we are allowed to proceed with the site investigation, we will be doing much more public consultations and that will allow us, LTA, to firm up on many of the answers to many of the questions that have yet to be answered, such as – who are affected, how much will it cost and so on. We have some idea because this is not the first time we are building an MRT line. We can have some idea about how much the cost will be, but one can never be sure because what happens underground is invisible; we do not know. And soil conditions, even though we are a tiny little red dot, the geology of east and west, north and south, can be very different. That is why it is so important to do a thorough site investigation.",
            "So, the bottom line is this – what we are seeking is permission, in this case, from MND, to allow us to proceed with the site investigation for which there is a necessity to do this EIA. The EIA, after two years of study, is now published online. By the gazette requirements, Singaporeans, interest groups, stakeholders, are invited to give their comments. I am quite sure MND will take all those views into consideration and decide whether they would allow the site investigation to proceed. And if they do, we can then enter into Phase 2 of the EIA, which will study what are the tunnelling methods, what will be the impact of those construction works and subsequent running of the train on the nature reserve, and more importantly whether, there are suitable mitigation measures.",
            "Sorry for a long reply, which is that there are many questions which remain unanswered. What I urge of Singaporeans is this: keep an open mind. Go with the facts, keep an open mind and look for the evidence.",
            "Madam, over the weekend, I took my granddaughter, 3 years old, to watch Disney's latest movie \"Zootopia\", the utopia for the animal kingdom where all animal species, even though they are former predators or preys can live in harmony, peaceful with one another. It was a good movie because it was not just for the kids; it carries important values, and some political messages. It tells the story of a little female bunny whose ambition is to bring about justice and change the world, and she wants to be a police officer. The police world, at that time was largely monopolised by larger animal species and all males. But she was determined to be a police officer. So, she had to fight stereotyping, sexism, racism, bias and prejudice. In the end, she succeeded through wit and effort, and demonstrated what she can achieve. Likewise, for the EIA, let us keep an open mind. I have read some of the very toxic comments on the EIA. They were made even before the EIA was published. I think there is an English word for that – that is bias, prejudice."

            ": Yes, indeed. As I have said, this four-to-five year study is a total impact study. The EIA is just an environmental impact study on a short stretch of a line, but our job is to do a total impact study: the impact on the environment, the impact on taxpayers, the impact on the commuters. I should not be biased. I should not be prejudiced. So, I am not opting for one or the other yet. I am keeping a completely open mind but there has been comments about the second option that of course, clearly, anybody reading the map would know, it will take a longer route, takes a longer time. To the commuters, it means extra time. The media have been guessing the figures; they say \"an extra four minutes\".",
            "I asked LTA, \"Is their estimation correct?\" And they did a calculation. They said, \"No, not quite.\" The extra time taken to cross the reserve if it takes a longer route is six minutes. Some people commented, \"Well, that is just a few minutes.\" I am not so sure we can just brush aside the extra six minutes, just like that, because in the mindset of the MRT commuters, an extra half a minute is already terrible. We know it! When the train has a disruption, causing an extra one minute of delay, commuters can, within that one minute, send off, maybe, 100 tweets to flame LTA or SMRT. So, an extra one minute is a lot of time, let alone six minutes! That is why, in the rail industry, they define disruption as anything that causes delay of more than five minutes; and six is more than five."

            ": Thank you. Let me begin as Members await the notes that are coming around. Madam, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the two possible underground alignments of the Cross Island Line (CRL) consists of two phases.",
            "Phase 1 of the EIA, which is where we are right now, focuses on the impact of site investigation on the two alignment options. The data and the findings from the site investigation are needed for Phase 2 of the EIA, which will provide a detailed assessment of the environmental impact of the construction and the operations of the CRL based on those two possible alignments.",
            "When LTA first announced the possible alignment of the CRL in 2013, nature groups understandably, raised concerns about the potential serious environmental impact that this may have on the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR). Because of these concerns, LTA formed a working group to define the scope of the EIA study of the CRL. This working group included representatives of nature groups. NParks also participated in the working group to provide views, inputs and the expertise. Separately, a group made up of residents staying around the CCNR expressed concern about how the possible alignments may affect their homes and LTA has been engaging them as well.",
            "Over the course of more than two years, LTA consulted the nature groups extensively in preparing for Phase 1 of the EIA. For example, in studying the impact of the proposed site investigation works on the water quality, ecology and biodiversity within the Nature Reserve, LTA's EIA consultant took into consideration a very useful baseline study on various aspects of the CCNR which was put together by our nature groups.",
            "As indicated in the Phase 1 EIA report, the impact assessment framework adopted by LTA's EIA consultant has two criteria. One, the sensitivity of the receptor, which is the CCNR in this case, and two, the magnitude of the environmental impact on the ground. So, if Members look at the handout: look at the x-axis – it talks about the sensitivity of the receptor; the y-axis – refers to the magnitude of the environmental impact. It is a framework which the EIA consultant uses to band an impact.",
            "LTA's EIA consultant has rated the sensitivity of the CCNR as \"high\", as it comprises primary rainforest with ecologically sensitive habitats. While this is so, the consultant has assessed the magnitude of impact due to the site investigation to be mainly \"small\". This is because of the adoption of stringent mitigating measures that had been proposed. These mitigation measures were arrived at in close consultation with several representatives of the nature groups and NParks. Both groups saw the report before it was published.",
            "Let me briefly describe what the site investigation entails and what mitigation measures have been proposed.",
            "The site investigation adopts two methods to determine the geological properties of the site. The first method is borehole drilling, by which boreholes, about 10 cm in diameter, are drilled to extract vertical columns of soil and rock samples. To minimise these disturbances and damage to the forest environment, the number of boreholes to be drilled will be reduced from an earlier estimate of 72 down to 16. More importantly, these boreholes will be confined to existing trails so as not to affect any vegetation. And the drilling machine will be modified to reduce the noise level and prevent spillage of slurry and fuel.",
            "To make up for the drastic reduction in the number of boreholes, and because boreholes will be restricted only to the trails, a second method of site investigation will be carried out. This involves non-intrusive geophysical survey. To carry this out, surveyors will venture off-trail into the forest to collect data using hand-held equipment. This will be of significantly lower impact than actual borehole drilling in the forest. So, they will manpack the equipment into the forest and they will place it on the ground to detect the signals and to determine the geology of the ground at the location.",
            "One of the concerns is that the surveyors may inadvertently trample on plants on the forest floor as they move through dense vegetation off-trail. So, the geophysical survey is therefore limited to a 100 m-wide corridor and will not be carried out in sensitive locations such as streams, swamps and dense vegetation. NParks officers will supervise the surveyors full-time to ensure that they adhere to the strict rules for movements in off-trail forested areas and to reduce damage from trampling on plants and vegetation. All site investigation activities will be restricted to daylight hours, so as not to affect nocturnal animals.",
            "These stringent measures have been incorporated into the Phase 1 EIA report, which will reduce the impact of the site investigation to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable. A great amount of efforts has been put in by all parties – representatives of nature groups, the National Parks Board and LTA – to arrive at this set of mitigation measures. The on-going public consultation for the EIA report, and this report has been put online, allows the public an opportunity to provide further suggestions to LTA on what more can be done to further reduce the impact of the site investigation."

            "Mdm Speaker, this year we will celebrate the National Day Parade (NDP) at the National Stadium after a hiatus of 10 years. When compared to other NDP sites at the Padang and the Marina Bay Floating Platform, the new setting calls for a different format. For example, what Members here particularly like and what Singaporeans like, the Red Lions parachuting down into the site will not be possible for obvious safety reasons. We will also not be able to have a mobile column or aerial displays – we just cannot see them.",
            "However, the new National Stadium also provides advantages for a different type of show, utilising the larger confined space and central pitch as a large stage. The NDP 2016 Executive Committee the EXCO – is excited about the possibilities that the new setting provides and has been hard at work preparing for NDP 2016 so that all Singaporeans can enjoy it and be proud of it.",
            "Another distinct advantage of the new National Stadium, because it has a seating capacity of 55,000, almost twice that of the number of Singaporeans that can watch it either at the Padang or the Marina Bay Platform, is exactly this: there will be many more Singaporeans who will be able to watch the rehearsals and the NDP physically at the site compared to the Marina Bay Floating Platform and the Padang. Both of these have capacities of about 25,000. In all, in the new site, we expect about 275,000 Singaporeans to be able to watch the National Education shows, the Preview show and NDP 2016 physically at the site. As with previous NDPs, \"live\" telecast will also allow Singaporeans to watch the shows at home.",
            "Let me address the questions which have been posed regarding costs of NDP at the National Stadium, and compare it, as asked, with NDPs held at the Marina Bay Floating Platform or the Padang. Previous NDPs at the Marina Bay Platform cost between $15.7 million and $17.9 million. The cost of NDP at the Padang in 2010 was $20.6 million and in 2015, $40.5 million. The cost of NDP at the National Stadium this year is expected to be about $39.4 million.",
            "There have been questions asked about itemised cost. Itemised cost comparisons between the three different sites, are sometimes difficult and not meaningful as the venue conditions vary considerably for each site. For example, among these factors, the number of \"live\" spectators in the main venue and surrounding areas, the costs for added security in some sites will be more than the others, and also the collateral impact of opportunity costs on surrounding businesses and retails shops. Be that as it may, I will still give some figures and some comparisons.",
            "The cost of the show segment, for example, for all three sites is similar, about half of total costs. But the cost to build infrastructure varies considerably. For example, each time we hold it at the Padang, we have to build all the spectator stands and that costs about 22% of the total cost, as you can well imagine. But it is negligible at the Marina Bay Floating Platform because it is already built, or the National Stadium. Venue costs, which was the question asked, are expected to be very low for public sites at the Marina Bay Floating Platform and the Padang – about 4% of total costs – because the Padang and the Marina Bay Floating Platform are public sites. For NDP 2016 at the National Stadium, the venue cost is about 15% of total costs, similar to other national events held at private venues.",
            "The Executive Committee is aware that after the Golden Jubilee NDP and SG50 celebrations, expectations of this year's show, NDP 2016, are high and I think that they have resigned themselves to the fact that comparisons will be inevitable. However, I believe that ultimately the NDP is a show with Singaporeans, for Singaporeans, and by Singaporeans. The committee will do their best to live up to expectations, but I ask that Singaporeans support the EXCO so that they can put up a really good NDP this year for all of us to celebrate together. Thank you."

The first supplementary question is he mentioned that for NDP 2016, the venue cost would be about 15% of the infrastructure cost, if I heard him correctly. Could he specify that in dollar terms, how much would the rental of the Sports Hub cost?",
            "The second question, Madam, we understand that the agreement between the Government and the Sports Hub allows MINDEF to use the Sports Hub for 45 days free of charge each year. My question is did the Government foresee that it would be holding the NDP at the Sports Hub? Next, why were only 45 days provided for when we understand that the average number of days needed for the NDP is closer to about 80 days?",
            "And, third, whether there is any dispute resolution mechanism provided for under the public-private partnership, between the Government and the Sports Hub, over the use of the Hub?"

The contract was negotiated as is, in the usual way that we negotiate with private providers and it is 15% of the total cost of the show, which is equivalent to the cost of public events held at private venues. Whether there is recourse for dispute resolution, I expect that it will be similar to all public contracts held in private venues as well."

For 2016, what is the proportion between the cost for rehearsals versus the cost for the actual venue for the actual day itself, as well as the key rehearsals? For example, the 45 days set aside versus the 80 days needed. Did the Ministry consider doing the rehearsals elsewhere and why were alternative locations not considered to save on the cost?"

In other words, they come together when they feel that there is a need to be physically at the stadium. Whether it is held in Padang, Floating Platform or the National Stadium, they start fairly early. In fact, they usually start about seven or eight months before the actual show in various groups, and some of these are held in camps. But ultimately, to put up a good show, we have to put people together and test it. Whether we could have done or we can do more of it off-site and then come to the venue itself, I leave it to the Executive Committee. The mandate and the deliverable for them is to put up a good show. I will pass the suggestion by the Member to them, to see whether they can reduce costs by doing it off-site and they will have to determine whether they can."

            ": Madam, the number of cable cut incidents has increased in recent years. The number of incidents has grown steadily, from four each in 2013 and 2014 to seven in 2015. In 2016 alone, there have already been three of such incidents.",
            "Madam, the rise in the number of cable cuts has been due to an increase in the number of road works and construction projects across Singapore in the past few years. All 18 cable cuts from 2013 to 2016 were caused by third-party contractors involved in the construction of new MRT lines, such as the Downtown Line and the Thomson East-Coast Line, power cabling, water and sewage piping works and other development projects. Of the 18, one was caused by contractors hired by a telecom operator.",
            "IDA takes a serious view of all cable cut incidents. Such incidents result in significant disruptions to telecommunication and media services delivered to our homes and businesses, causing great inconvenience to thousands of subscribers for many hours.",
            "IDA's investigations revealed that most, if not all, of these cable cut incidents could have been avoided if contractors exercised due diligence and caution when undertaking road works and construction projects. These contractors failed to comply with clearly established standard operating procedures (SOPs), such as ascertaining the location of telecommunication cables prior to commencing earthworks and protecting underground cables against damage when they carried out their earthworks. In 16 of these cases, the service plans and cable detection reports obtained by the contractors clearly indicated the presence of telecommunication cables. In the remaining two cases, the contractors did not obtain the necessary service plans and engage cable detection workers to detect the cables.",
            "Madam, the Telecommunications Act requires any contractor who intends to carry out earthworks within the vicinity of telecommunication cables to take certain precautions. They have to:",
            "First, give seven days' or more notice to the relevant telecom operators before the proposed earthworks;",
            "Second, obtain information on the location of telecommunication cables and consult the operators on appropriate steps to prevent possible cable damage while the earthworks are being carried out;",
            "Finally, engage licensed telecommunication cable detection workers to detect such cables so that contractors can avoid these cables when carrying out their work.",
            "Any contractor who fails to observe these precautions and damages any telecommunication cables while carrying out earthworks, may be fined up to $1 million and imprisoned for five years. IDA has previously prosecuted errant parties in court, which imposed penalties ranging from $60,000 to $570,000.",
            "Given the rise in the number of cable cut incidents, IDA is doing more. It is working closely with public agencies and telecom operators on preventive measures. I understand that our telecom operators have agreed to advise contractors on the type of earthworks that should be avoided and the additional procedures to adhere to before and during earthworks. These include digging \"trial holes\" to locate any cables in the vicinity before commencing any earthworks and to contact the relevant telcos should they encounter any difficulty in locating the cables. IDA has also been participating in regular dialogue sessions held by agencies, such as LTA and EMA, with their contractors. These sessions are meant to educate the contractors on the established SOPs and the precautionary measures needed to prevent a cable from being cut.",
            "To aid efforts in locating telecommunication cables going forward, IDA has directed all telcos to indicate GPS geographical coordinates for new deployments of telecommunication cables and manholes on their service plans; and to install metallic tracer wires along new underground optical fibre cables. These measures will help facilitate the detection of new underground telecommunication cables and, hopefully, reduce the occurrence of cable cuts.",
            "At the same time, IDA will thoroughly investigate and prosecute those responsible for cable cuts, and will apply for deterrent sentences upon conviction.",
            "Mdm Speaker, frequent telecommunication cable cuts will diminish Singapore's reputation as a reliable business and financial hub, and undermine our efforts to build a Smart Nation. My Ministry and IDA will continue to work closely with other public agencies to reduce the frequency of such cuts. I wish to emphasise that the parties involved in road works or construction projects must also adopt the necessary precautions to avoid such incidents. Only through a concerted effort by all relevant parties can cable cut incidents be avoided."

We have sometimes as long as a couple of days, as well as a couple of hours, and the consumers affected can also vary, depending on the network configuration. The largest area we know of is probably in some parts of the areas in the northwest of Singapore. By and large, the most important thing is that the telcos have remediation programmes in place to make sure that we can minimise the disruption.",
            "At the end of the day, I think if we can minimise the cable cuts, then we do not have to deal with all these problems. We know that our underground is getting congested and, therefore, we need to work with the agencies and, more importantly, to educate the contractors that they have to take due diligence to avoid such an incident."

A majority of these companies were from the property, retail and financial sectors.",
            "PDPC's investigations revealed that most companies who flouted the DNC rules did not clearly understand the requirements of the rules and how to comply with them. Given that it was still early days of the Act and most complaints involved one-off breaches, PDPC issued advisory notices and warnings to about 3,000 organisations. These were meant to provide useful guidance to these companies on specific steps to be taken, in order to comply with the DNC rules.",
            "For the more egregious cases, PDPC prosecuted two organisations: Star Zest Home Tuition and its director, and a salesperson from Huttons Asia in 2014. They continued to send multiple, unsolicited telemarketing messages to numbers listed in the DNC Registry, despite being notified by PDPC not to do so. In addition, two others had their offences compounded in lieu of prosecution, given that the breaches were not as serious.",

As these activities come under the purview of the Police, PDPC has been referring such complaints to the Police.",
            "The PDPC has been proactive in its public education and outreach efforts to organisations and members of the public. PDPC has conducted briefings and workshops for organisations to explain how the Act would apply to various types of businesses and what organisations would need to do to ensure compliance. PDPC's online e-learning and educational resources have also been helpful, especially for smaller organisations. PDPC also collaborates with other agencies, such as the Law Society of Singapore and SPRING's SME Centres, to offer advice and consultation services to smaller businesses.",

The WHO further noted that there was strong association of the PHEIC with Zika virus transmission in the affected areas.",
            "NEA has an on-going surveillance programme for Zika virus since 2014. Prior to the WHO's declaration, MOH and NEA had already enhanced the surveillance, as well as stepped up measures, to reduce the risk of the Zika virus taking root in Singapore. Since 26 January this year, Zika virus infection has been added to the List of Notifiable Infectious Diseases under the Infectious Diseases Act. All doctors have been advised to stay vigilant against possible cases of Zika virus infection and on the protocols for testing and managing of suspect and confirmed cases. So far, there has not been any reported case of Zika virus infection in Singapore.",
            "To reduce the risk of Zika becoming entrenched in Singapore, all confirmed cases will be admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital until they recover and test negative for the virus. MOH will also screen people in the vicinity of the home and workplace of confirmed cases for Zika virus infection.",
            "In addition, we have issued advisories to travellers to and from Zika-affected countries on how to protect themselves against mosquito bites. We have also reminded travellers who have returned to Singapore from affected areas to monitor their health and consult a doctor if they have symptoms of Zika, such as fever, skin rashes, joint and muscle pains, headaches and red eyes, and to reveal their travel history to their doctor. If they have such symptoms after coming back from areas with Zika transmission, blood samples will be taken for Zika testing.",
            "In the light of the WHO's declaration, MOH and NEA have worked together to introduce additional measures. MOH is expanding Zika virus testing capability to more public hospital laboratories. NEA has also stepped up the testing of blood samples from patients with fever and rash and suspected dengue for Zika, as part of its Zika virus surveillance efforts. Given the suspected link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and microcephaly in newborns, MOH has also set up a Clinical Advisory Group on Zika virus infection and pregnancy to provide expert advice on the management of pregnant women with Zika virus infection. In addition, HSA has also required that donors with a history of travel to outbreak areas be deferred from donating blood for 28 days upon return.",
            "As recommended by the WHO, surveillance for microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) has been enhanced, to pick up any unusual trends. MOH is also looking at potential areas for collaboration and research with the relevant institutions on Zika virus diagnostics, transmission and the association with microcephaly and GBS.",
            "In addition, if a case is detected here, NEA and other agencies under the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force, such as MOM and PUB, will intensify search and destroy efforts to control the Aedes mosquito population at the implicated sites to contain any potential spread.",
            "As Zika is transmitted through the same Aedes mosquito that transmits dengue, vector control remains the mainstay to prevent transmission of the Zika virus. NEA has stepped up its vector control efforts, in partnership with the community, agencies and stakeholders, to control the mosquito population. NEA has also brought forward the annual \"Do the Mozzie Wipeout\" Campaign this year − in fact, it was held yesterday − as part of its community outreach efforts to raise awareness of the 5-Step Mozzie Wipeout and urge the community to take immediate action to prevent mosquito breeding.

Containment measures like isolation of cases, contact tracing and quarantine of close contacts are important for SARS. For Zika, vector control remains paramount. MOH will isolate confirmed cases of Zika infection to reduce the risk of transmission in the community. But once there is community spread – that is, if Zika virus takes root and infection takes root in the community – we will then move from containment to mitigation measures. Measures to admit a confirmed case, isolate him until he recovers and history of the virus will not work anymore. So, we will move to containment measures and move to mitigation measures and this means that we will take measures similar to dengue prevention and control – that is, source reduction."

The National Environment Agency (NEA) does not practise the alternating of chemicals used in fogging as a standard procedure. Instead, fogging is carried out in a selective and targeted manner to avoid the build-up of resistance in the mosquito population. As an additional safeguard, NEA regularly monitors the resistance of mosquitoes against insecticides to ensure that the insecticides used are effective.",

The next question is: some of the flats under the JSS are currently occupied by only one tenant instead of two. What actions is HDB taking to ensure that such flats are prudently and optimally rented out? My last question: although there is now the option of a rental flat with a partition, will HDB consider other rental flat options for singles, so as to reduce such conflicts of strangers living together?

Usually, these are medical-related conditions. In cases of difficulty getting along, we will usually allow some time for the RCs, local grassroots as well as the Community Mediation Centre to mediate between the two tenants and hope for a good resolution. In cases for which the tenants cannot get along, we would usually not force such pairings and may exercise some flexibility but we would usually seek an approach in which we encourage the tenants to continue to look for an eligible partner with whom they can get along to share the flat with."

The partitions will divide the bed area into two with the living area, kitchen and the toilets as the common amenities. Each bed area will have sufficient spaces, as I had said earlier, to accommodate a bed as well as a small wardrobe, so that there is some degree of privacy for the tenants within a 1-room configuration.

            ": The Women's Charter was passed in 1961. It is a historical and significant Act. It instituted the rights of women, and protected vulnerable women and girls exposed to vice. The Women's Charter was also pivotal in strengthening the family institution, which is a key pillar of our society. It upheld monogamy and outlined the rights and duties of married persons. Strong marriages and families are as important and relevant today, if not more so.",
            "However, with the passage of time, families evolve. And families in Singapore are changing as well. Let me share a few trends which we have observed and which led us to review the Women's Charter.",
            "First, there are more dual-income families where both the husband and wife work. We also see small, but increasing instances, of wives being the main breadwinner.",
            "Second, divorces are becoming more common among recent cohorts, and especially so for couples who got married at a very young age. Children are often adversely affected, even long after the divorces.",
            "Third, there are more Singaporeans marrying non-Singaporeans. The vast majority are genuine but there are also some marriages of convenience for immigration advantage.",
            "Fourth, the increasing prevalence of social media, which requires new measures to protect those who experience family violence and also the professionals who engage in protection work.",
            "Our social policies, infrastructure and legal provisions must be regularly updated to support families. My Ministry has been doing so. The proposed legislative amendments we are making to the Women's Charter today is one part of this larger effort.",
            "Specifically, the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter will, firstly, help support younger couples in their transition into married life and parenthood; secondly, better protect the interest of children affected by their parents' divorce; thirdly, allow incapacitated husbands and ex-husbands to apply for spousal maintenance when there is a clear need; fourthly, void marriages of convenience; fifthly, better support vulnerable persons in family violence and crisis situations; and lastly, strengthen law enforcement against online vice.",
            "Let me elaborate.",
            "First, we must continue to strengthen marriages and families. This is, and will remain, one of the Ministry of Social and Family Development's key priorities. We have different services, programmes and public outreach initiatives towards this objective.",
            "However, notwithstanding these efforts, divorces are becoming more common. This is very much a global phenomenon. To cite a statistic, for example, 20.3% of our 1998 marriage cohort had dissolved before the 15th anniversary, compared to 12.3% of the 1987 marriage cohort. Marriages involving couples where one or both parties are very young face higher risk. A fair number are not adequately prepared for marriage. Those who become parents shortly after marriage do face additional stress.",
            "In 2011, the Women's Charter was amended to require minor couples to attend a Marriage Preparation Programme if one party is below the age of 18 years, or if both parties are minors below 21 years old. About 200 minor couples have gone through the programme. We are very heartened that over 95% of them found it useful.",
            "We will now amend the Women's Charter rules to extend the Marriage Preparation Programme to all marriages where one party is a minor. Agencies that currently conduct the Marriage Preparation Programme will do so for this additional group of couples. This will take effect for marriages on and after 1 October 2016.",
            "Beyond legislation, we will also enhance the pre- and post-marriage support continuum for this group of couples. We will put in place group marriage education programmes, one-on-one marriage assessments and post-marriage support sessions by 2017.",
            "Even as we try to strengthen marriages, there will be those that have irretrievably broken down. Divorcing couples and their family members go through periods of anger, anxiety, grief and stress. The children are often the ones most adversely impacted when caught in the middle of their parents' fights.",
            "Let me cite you some examples that we had picked up while working with families. There was a child whose paternal grandma told her that if she really loved her daddy, she should stop thinking of mommy. The little girl grieved over this but hid it from her dad and grandmother because she did not want to disappoint them; she did not want to make them angry.",
            "Another example. There was a child who was told by her mother that her daddy did not love her anymore, as he had a new family with a new baby. The child felt abandoned, unloved and insecure. She asked whether her mommy would also not love her anymore if she had a new baby herself. These are stories which the children shared with some of our workers who work with families. And these stories tell us that we must always make sure that children's voices are heard and their interests and needs are taken care of during divorces.",
            "In 2011, the Ministry amended the Women's Charter to require divorcing parents with children to attend mandatory mediation and counselling after a writ of divorce has been filed. This has been quite effective in helping some divorcing couples reach agreements on children matters in less acrimonious ways.",
            "But going for mandatory mediation and counselling on children's issues, after first battling it out in Court to settle the divorce, is really not ideal. Many divorcing parties have become hardened in their positions or too caught up with their emotions, by then. Social workers, counsellors and lawyers have told us it is much better to have divorcing parents consider their children's well-being early, before the divorce process formally starts.",
            "We are, therefore, introducing a new section 94A in the Women's Charter to require divorcing couples with minor children who are not able to agree on all matters of divorces to attend a mandatory parenting programme before they can file for divorce. For a start, those with at least one child aged below 14 years will be required to attend the programme. We plan to eventually extend this requirement to those with children aged below 21 years old.",
            "The new pre-divorce mandatory parenting programme will cover a range of issues that will have a tangible impact on children such as housing, school, care arrangements, and bread and butter issues. These practical aspects, when overlooked, add unnecessary turmoil to a child's life post-divorce.",
            "The new mandatory programme will also stress the importance of positive co-parenting after divorce. Even though a marriage ends, parental responsibilities remain. And I think it is important that parents remember that. Children need both parents to co-parent even after divorce. Allow me to say this with the best of intentions. I know that co-parenting is not easy. But, in many cases, it is probably the best \"gift\" that divorced parents can give to their children – the certainty that they still have both parents to love them despite everything. Then, the children do not feel that they have to take sides; they do not feel they are to blame; and they do not feel guilty.",
            "The process where divorcing parents go through in applying for the mandatory parenting programme will also include self-reflection questions − questions that focus parents' minds on their children's well-being. For those who may still have questions about their marriage and divorce, we will also point them to agencies that provide marital counselling. I hope that with this, perhaps some, upon reflection, may actually reconsider divorce and seek help for their problems.",
            "During our public consultation on the Bill, some members of the public expressed concern that the new mandatory requirement could lengthen the divorce process. They felt that in some situations, for example, where there is family violence, the divorce process needs to be expeditious.",
            "Let me assure the House that our intention is not to make it more onerous for parties to be granted a divorce. Neither do we aim to make it easier. But the objective is to better equip parties with knowledge and awareness of the issues arising in a divorce that will affect their children. It will enable couples to be more informed and make child-centric decisions during the process of divorce.",
            "The pre-divorce mandatory parenting programme will be funded by my Ministry and conducted by the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (DSSAs). These four agencies offer a range of programmes and services. Since they started operating a year ago, they have served over 3,000 divorcing couples. The feedback from the couples and their children, as well as from judges and community partners, has been positive.",
            "I will now move on to the next area of amendments, which is on maintenance. Today, under the Women's Charter, maintenance may be ordered for two broad categories. The first is maintenance for children. Both fathers and mothers are responsible for maintaining or contributing to the maintenance of their children. This is so even after a divorce, and whether or not they have custody of the children. A mother may, therefore, seek child-maintenance from the father, and vice versa.",
            "The second category of maintenance is for a spouse or ex-spouse. This is the focus of the proposed amendment. Today, a woman can seek spousal maintenance from her husband or ex-husband. The law, however, does not enable men to seek spousal maintenance from their wives or ex-wives. This is something that is increasingly being questioned and debated, and my Ministry has certainly received a broad range of opinions.",
            "At one end of the spectrum, some Singaporeans have argued that spousal maintenance should be gender-blind and based on needs. Let me cite you an email feedback that we received during the public consultation; and I think it sums it up quite neatly. The writer wrote, \"I find it hard to believe that Singapore, a First World society, is unable to accept that women should be our equals and should provide towards maintaining their ex-spouse equally if he is unable to do so.\"",
            "Along this line of argument, some Singaporeans proposed that matters relating to marriage and divorce be addressed through a new \"Family Charter\", rather than the Woman's Charter.",
            "At the other end of the spectrum, there are those who feel strongly that men should be the main breadwinner – and by and large they remain so – and spousal maintenance should be reserved for women only. After all, a wife is more likely to give up her career to care for the family. She is also more likely to be financially more vulnerable post-divorce. Allow me to quote from two emails we have received to illustrate.",
            "One said, \"Despite the call of gender equality, we must face the reality that there cannot be absolute equality between the two genders. Moreover, it remains in our culture and in fact among men themselves, the notion that the husband is deemed the \"protector\" of the family.\"",
            "Another argued: \"Remember that the Women's Charter is supposed to protect women's rights and not allow women to fall prey to the irresponsibility of men who wilfully refused to work, in the name of providing care for the family.\"",
            "Clearly, there are very emotive and strong responses from various ends of the spectrum and in between them as well. I do not honestly think there is one decision that can satisfy all the differing views. This is one issue that there will be a range of issues. There is merit on both sides. Indeed, there are more women today with more successful careers. Some of you may have read about a recent Court of Appeal judgement which disallowed a woman's claim for a nominal maintenance order of $1. The Court found her \"more than capable\" of taking care of herself.",
            "On the other hand, we still have many women who are struggling to provide a decent home for herself and her children, after years of being a homemaker during the marriage. As Members of Parliament, I think many of us would have encountered such real life examples during our Meet-the-People Session and when we meet our residents.",
            "After extensive discussions with stakeholders and internal deliberations, we have concluded that, our society is not quite fully ready for gender neutrality on spousal maintenance front and we will not rename the Women's Charter as a Family Charter at this time, despite some calls to do so, in line with the philosophy of gender-neutrality.",
            "There remain many vulnerable women, and many women who hold rank and file jobs, who need to be able to rely on their husbands or ex-husbands for maintenance for themselves and their children. However we do note the feedback provided and we will keep this issue on watch and consider them in the future.",
            "That said, we do feel that time is right for us to take a step to allow incapacitated husband and ex-husbands to apply for spousal maintenance where there is a clear need.",
            "Recently, one of our divorce support specialist agencies highlighted a case they handled. This concerns a man with a professional job. He was unfortunately struck with a debilitating illness while on an overseas work assignment. The illness left him mentally incapacitated and unable to work. His wife, equally successful in her career, divorced him, and now he has no way to support himself.",
            "In yet another case, my Parliamentary Secretary met a male resident who became severely disabled after a serious work accident. His wife divorced him. He is very bitter because he has no recourse for support, despite years of having provided for his wife and family.",
            "We are proposing amendments that will allow, for the first time, spousal maintenance to be extended to such husbands and ex-husbands. This is part and parcel of the mutual help and support expected when a man and a woman enter into a marriage. Stories such as what I have shared reinforce our sense that this is one area we should do.",
            "We have set three clear criteria that must all be met. Only a man who is (i) incapacitated before or during the course of the marriage, (ii) unable to earn a livelihood and (iii) unable to support himself, therefore can claim maintenance. He must also be unable to support himself at the time when the maintenance application is heard.",
            "For clarity, I will give some examples which will not be covered. These include:",
            "(i) An incapacitated husband or ex-husband who is able to earn a livelihood sufficient to maintain himself;",
            "(ii) An incapacitated husband or ex-husband who has other means, such as income from investments or insurance pay-outs, to support himself; and",
            "(iii) An ex-husband who became incapacitated after the divorce has been finalised.",
            "An ex-wife is not expected, and does not have any obligation to provide spousal maintenance if her ex-husband does not meet the criteria up to the point of divorce.",
            "During our public consultation, we also received a lot of feedback on maintenance enforcement. I think many of us feel very strongly about this issue – I certainly do. We have received many heartfelt appeals and letters talk of maintenance payments slipping, being irregular or not being paid. I can understand how frustrating this can be for an ex-spouse who is not only entitled to but who relies on the maintenance to keep the family going after divorce.",
            "At the last round of amendments in 2011, we introduced several measures to strengthen maintenance enforcement. Today, the Court may order a defaulter's employer to pay maintenance directly out of the defaulter's salary, mandate that a defaulter attend financial counselling and even sentence a defaulter to jail.",
            "We do not need more legislative changes this round on this front. Many of the challenges lie instead with implementation. This is where we need to improve and this is what we must tackle.",
            "To this end, my Ministry has been working closely with the Family Justice Courts and the Community Justice Centre to strengthen the working relationship between our agencies. We find that there are basically two broad groups of defaulters: Firstly, those who \"cannot pay\"; secondly those who \"won't pay\". We will need to address them differently.",
            "We will extend timely financial assistance to vulnerable wives and ex-wives and their children in cases where the husband or ex-husband genuinely cannot pay maintenance. For example, he could be in jail, or has had a serious accident and cannot work. Such wives or ex-wives will be directed to my Ministry's Social Service Offices (SSOs) for financial assistance. Our SSOs will also refer them to the Community Justice Centre for legal assistance should there be a need.",
            "Our focus here is on the women and children, as they are often the victims. But that said, we will also help a husband or ex-husband whose circumstances have changed such that he genuinely cannot pay maintenance. For example, if he has a serious debilitating illness and is not able to work for a sustained period, he may approach the Community Justice Centre for legal assistance to review the maintenance orders. He may also approach the SSOs. The SSOs will help not only the man, but also his wife or ex-wife, with financial assistance so that the family may tide over the difficult period and get back on their feet.",
            "In contrast to this more empathetic approach, we do intend to be very much more firm with these recalcitrant maintenance defaulters in the so-called \"won't pay\" group - this means those who have the means but choose not to honour their maintenance payments. This is where there is much distress, anger and bitterness in the part of wives and ex-wives especially. They know their husbands refuse to pay maintenance for themselves and their children and we intend to seriously stop such irresponsible behaviour.",
            "So, we are working closely with the Courts to appoint a Maintenance Record Officer (MRO). This officer will assist the Court in certain maintenance enforcement applications so as to identify those who can afford but refuse to pay maintenance. With the assessment of the individual's ability to pay, Judges will be in a better position to make full use of the range of enforcement levers introduced in the 2011 round of amendments. Judges can impose tougher penalties against these recalcitrant individuals and I hope that they do.",
            "Related to maintenance are child access issues. As a Member, and many of you can relate to this, we have encountered many heart-rending appeals for divorced parents to see their children. Often, it is the fathers who have been denied access. By July this year, the Divorce Support Agencies will double their capacity of supervised exchange and visits for children. With an increase in capacity, our agencies will be better able to facilitate child access arrangements. Very importantly, they will work with parents to co-parent more effectively.",
            "As a husband and a father, I would like to take this opportunity to remind all men to be responsible, especially when you have child maintenance to pay. Parenting your child does not stop even when the marriage is over. You can still and always be a loving father by not neglecting your responsibility to provide for your children. Even if your marriage is over, a caring relationship with you as a father will help your child to heal and learn to trust all over again. So not only in terms of maintenance, spend time.",
            "Earlier, I mentioned that there are more marriages between Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans. The numbers of marriages between Singaporeans and non-residents have been increasing from 5,411 in 2004, and a decade later in 2014, 6,686.",
            "The vast majority of such marriages are genuine. But there are instances where parties enter into a sham marriage for immigration purposes. In 2012, MHA introduced a provision in the Immigration Act criminalising such marriages for immigration advantage. Parties convicted can be fined or imprisoned, or both, with their immigration facilities revoked. As of 2015, 218 parties have been convicted.",
            "It is an offence for parties to abuse marriage laws for immigration advantage. It follows therefore that such marriages should be void. The new Section 11A will now make a marriage void if one party to the marriage is convicted of the marriage of convenience offence under the Immigration Act.",
            "Let me move on to the issue of protection. Men, women and children who experience family violence require help. Today, in the event of violence within the family, a married man or woman below 21 years of age has to rely on others such as a parent or a guardian to apply for a protection order on his or her behalf.",
            "Given that most married persons below 21 years old already have familial responsibilities such as care for children, Section 65 is to be amended to provide for married or previously married persons below 21 years old, to apply for protection orders for themselves and their children. This is similar to the provisions in the Act that govern the parties allowed to apply for maintenance orders.",
            "Some women and girls in crisis situations may, at times, need temporary emergency accommodation at places of safety such as crisis shelters or residential facilities. The Bill introduces new community-based care options by allowing the Director of Social Welfare to also place a vulnerable woman, or girl below 21 years of age into the care of a ‘fit individual'. This could be a relative or friend who could provide support in a \"home environment\", and not only in residential facilities or shelters.",
            "Some professionals that my Ministry works with in protection work include the staff in Family Service Centres, Family Violence Specialist Centres and crisis shelters. We will provide immunity for such professionals when they assist vulnerable individuals or discharge their duties in good faith and with reasonable care. In this way, they are protected against lawsuits or other legal proceedings in their personal capacity when carrying out a court order, acting under the direction of the Minister or the Director of Social Welfare in discharging duties under the Act.",
            "The rise of online platforms and social media also pose new dangers to victims of abuse and challenges to the professionals who protect them. A new section 177A will prohibit the publication or broadcast of any information in the mass and social media that would reveal or is likely to identify the location of the shelter, residential facility or its residents. This is to better prevent perpetrators of violence from harassing, intimidating or harming persons residing or working at places of safety. The State may also act against serious breaches by the media which compromises the safety of the residents and staff.",
            "A related amendment is made to section 153 to prohibit publishing of information via online media which may lead to women and girls being identified in certain in-camera Court proceedings.",
            "The rise of online media has also allowed vice syndicates to take their businesses online to widen their reach to clients, while hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet. This makes it challenging for the Police to prevent and detect criminal groups conducting such a business. Sexual services at hotels and residences arranged by vice syndicates using new technologies also affect the public's sense of safety and security.",
            "The proposed amendments will enhance the Police's levers to address online vice. They will make it an offence for persons in Singapore to operate or maintain in Singapore any website or other remote communication service that offers or facilitates the provision of sexual services in return for payment. They will also enable the Police to take action against a person who aids or will aid the prostitution of another person by providing any service, such as setting up a website to advertise such services, and who receives any gratification, whether cash or in kind, for providing that service.",
            "Let me now conclude. The family remains the key pillar in our society. As families continue to change in Singapore, we will also have to continue to review our policies, services and programmes. We will also regularly update our legislations. The legislative amendments I am proposing to the Women's Charter today is one part of this broad effort.",
            "Many Singaporean organisations and individuals have contributed to this exercise. Some have generously provided their professional knowledge and expertise. Others have given their inputs and feedback during our consultation. And I would like to thank all of them for their contributions.",
            "I believe that this set of amendments we are proposin, and the other changes we are making to policies and services, will help strengthen marriages, support families and render protection and assistance to those who are more vulnerable. With that, Madam, I beg to move."

            ": Mdm Speaker, gender equality has long been a heavily debated issue across national borders, cultures and generations. Regardless how far we have come, how much further we should go, one thing is for sure – as a nation, we pledged to build an equal and democratic society. Prejudice against either gender is frowned upon in the workplaces and public domains. Yet, it is common to find that cultural baggage from the past continues to hinder our progress in the pursuit of gender equality. There is a Chinese saying, 男主外，女主内. This continues to be presumed and desired as the default relationship dynamic.",
            "Husbands are expected to build their careers and take home the bread, while the wives handle the kids and household matters, regardless of their interests and professional abilities.",
            "The Women's Charter was established in 1961 to empower the law to protect women who were seen as the weaker sex. Back in those days, many women did not pursue higher levels of learning, and they would marry and become stay-home moms almost after leaving school. Or, they would quit their jobs when they decided to have a family. Granting maintenance to women in a divorce has been the rightful thing to do in appreciation of her contribution to the family when she has sacrificed her youth and potential incomes. Today, the female demographic is vastly different. Labour force statistics last year showed that employment rate for woman in Singapore was 76% for the prime working ages of 25 to 54.",
            "Many also held positions of authority in their workplaces. According to some divorce lawyers, between 30% and 50% of women in divorce cases earn as much, if not more than the men.",
            "The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has for years called for the extension of spousal maintenance to men. This is in line with alimon y laws in societies where gender equality is actively pursued, such as Britain, the US and Canada. But the Ministry deduced from talks with various groups that our society is not ready for women to shoulder the same responsibilities as men, and so up till today, men are still not able to claim alimony, apart from a small group of men in genuine need that can get spousal support. Hence, with this Bill I would say any progress is good progress. It is good that we have made this small step out.",
            "I strongly believe that men who quit their jobs to become house-husbands on mutual consent and perform their designated roles adequately, should also be entitled to maintenance. Please note \"mutual consent\" because I also have residents who told me that their husbands are lazy to work and, hence, they are forced to become the sole breadwinner and some of them have to work day and night, taking on more than one job and their husband goes out",
            "jalan-jalan",
            ". So, for cases like this, when it comes to divorce, the husband should not be entitled to any maintenance, even though he is not fit to work.",
            "I also believe that the Courts should weigh carefully in cases where the wife is better off than the husband, and has not been financially dependent on him during their marriage. I refer to the case where Justice Choo Han Teck, who, in 2014, generated somewhat of a debate when he rejected a woman's $120,000 maintenance claim from her former spouse after their 10-year marriage ended in 2012. The wife in this case earned slightly more than the husband, grossing $215,900 in annual income. She also had more than twice the assets he had. Justice Choo had rightly said that to award the woman even a token sum \"would be wrong if it was merely symbolic. That symbol for women has to be torn asunder, in fact and in spirit\". It is unfortunate that not every man in a similar situation gets a fair resolution.",
            "I have heard from divorce lawyers' cases where men have clearly been taken advantage of, though there is not much publicity. So, this amendment is timely.",
            "Mdm Speaker, what is equally important, if not more important, is to make maintenance claims more straightforward. More resources and enforcement should, in fact, be dedicated to spouses who are truly deserving of maintenance and alimony. We have to find a more effective means of prosecuting ex-spouses who default on maintenance fees that they are rightfully supposed to provide. I have encountered cases in which the women had to spend a lot of time frantically trying to secure much-needed child support and financial support from their irresponsible ex-husbands.",
            "Sometimes, a woman has to go to court every few months to get her ex-husband to pay up. In one of those cases, a woman had her case drag on for 10 years and heard by over 20 judges. Imagine! Ten years! Ten years of suffering! Ten years of uncertainty! She had given up her career for the sake of their four children, and upon divorce, was left to raise them on her own without monetary contribution from her ex-husband. Imprisoning the man for a token few days as a punishment is hardly beneficial if he is determined to make the life of his ex-wife very difficult. I think a woman should not have to haul her husband off to Court repeatedly if he is habitually paying maintenance fees late or not paying up at all. His poor track record should be more than enough for immediate tougher action. Right now, it is by definition the men who are defaulting, but in the future we could see women default as well. Reforms in this aspect will benefit spouses who are awarded alimony, whether male or female.",
            "In 2014, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam shared his concerns. He said that a faster, simpler and more effective system is being planned to get defaulters to pay up. I look forward to an update about this new system. The process of seeking maintenance from an unwilling hand is undoubtedly a gruelling and worrisome one. I hope more support can be given to those long-suffering spouses. There should also be",
            "pro bono",
            "lawyers to help with the legal matters. There should be readily accessible support networks that they can tap on, with counsellors who can offer guidance and help to find fuss-free assistance for a range of related issues from financial aid to housing, health and school matters.",
            "In a divorce, children are most vulnerable to negative emotions and negligence. I support the Bill's implementation of a mandatory parenting programme for divorcing parents.",
            "A marriage may not be salvageable, but both parents can, and should continue to conduct their parental responsibilities, assist their children to adapt to the changes, and possibly continue to carry significant responsibility in the later part of the children's lives. Here is where I want to touch on visitation rights to children. This is something that needs to be addressed in the parenting programme as part of a post-divorce plan where all the arrangements concerning the child are mapped out, from visitation schedules, decision- making to parenting responsibilities and more. Additionally, make counselling and support programmes for children of divorced marriages comprehensive and easily accessible. Counsellors must work closely with parents to ensure that the children are attending the sessions and programmes as regularly as required with the goal of adapting well to their new life with one parent.",
            "To conclude, we cannot prevent divorces, or the hard feelings that some divorces will bring. But we need to minimise the adverse effects of divorces to our society, especially the children. An equal maintenance regime, where ex-spouses can easily seek arrears, and encouragement to cooperate on childcare are all factors that bring about this positive change. Mdm Speaker, let me summarise in Chinese as well.",
            "The amendments have two changes which can help families that unfortunately are going through divorce. First, those ex-husbands who cannot work due to health reasons will be able to seek maintenance from their ex-wife. Today, there are many women who are as successful as men in the workplace. Hence, we can gradually move towards gender equality in terms of paying maintenance. Second, we will make it mandatory for divorcing parents to attend specialised Parenting Programme to minimise the impact of divorce on their children.",
            "On the other hand, there are still many women who face the problem of their ex-husband not-paying maintenance. The Minister for Law said before that the Ministry was studying some changes in this area. I hope the authorities can simplify the relevant procedures and give these women greater help. I support the motion."

            "On strengthening maintenance, enforcement and support, I agree with what the Minister had shared that it is not about increasing legislation and that we should consider the efficacy of the processes which are supposed to deliver the objectives espoused in the Women's Charter. I would like to highlight some instances where we should make the implementation more seamless.",
            "For instance, where there is a default in the payment of the maintenance order, the aggrieved party has to make an application in person at the Family Courts to make a maintenance complaint and the Court will then serve a maintenance summons on the defaulter.",
            "However, sometimes in the case of persistent serial defaulters, the aggrieved party may be so tired out by the process of having to physically attend Court each time the defaulter defaults, that she eventually gives up claiming the maintenance amount due to her. This is especially relevant for those who face financial difficulty in the first place and can ill afford to take leave from work or from taking care of their children to go to the Family Courts to make the application in person and attend Court for the subsequent mentions or for the trials. And in the case of \"incapacitated husbands\", I am not sure if he is physically able to make the application at the Family Courts should his ex-wife default.",
            "Further, should the defaulter fail to turn up in Court, he or she can be found in contempt of the Court and a warrant of arrest issued. However, what in reality happens is that no arrest is actually made as warrants of arrests are issued for a variety of reasons including non-payment of parking fines or service and conservancy charges and it is impossible to task the Police to arrest every person who has a warrant of arrest issued against him or her.",
            "Lastly, though a garnishee order can be made to secure maintenance payments against bank accounts, each garnishee order is once off, meaning, that the aggrieved party typically bundles months of arrears owed to him or her, before making an application for a garnishee order to the courts and in the meantime, the aggrieved party faces financial difficulties without the maintenance payments. There are also instances where the bank account is closed by the defaulter and there is no information on his other bank accounts.",
            "As such, while I listen with interest what the Minister has shared with regards to the appointment of a Maintenance Record Officer, I would like to urge further the following considerations. That, number one, the application process for maintenance complaints to be made more convenient for an ex-husband or ex-wife who wants to serve a private summons on their ex-spouse who has defaulted on maintenance payments. An example could be to have the application done at family service centres and in the case of an incapacitated husband, that a proxy should be allowed.",
            "And in the case where there is a warrant of arrest issued for an ex-spouse who can pay and refuses to pay, that an agency or system of bailiffs and perhaps the MRO that the Minister has spoken about, be tasked to enforce the actual arrest of the defaulter to give teeth to the charter. With that, I support the amendments to the Bill."

            "On maintenance for incapacitated husbands, whilst I consider it as a right and humane thing to do, there are some who argue that we are drifting towards the equal rights issue where, in the past, such responsibility rested solely on the men with the traditional role of men supporting women instead of the vice versa. Some have also asked if this is going to be the beginning of change towards equal rights with more amendments to come on the Women's Charter to equalise in all aspects. I can understand this argument because with our Asian-values based society here, we have yet to reach the level of gender equality to be looking at equal rights in all aspects. For example, women are still under-represented at senior management levels, child-rearing and care-giving responsibilities are still considered roles for women with many young women having to put their jobs on hold and also, some women are not paid equally as their male counterparts for similar jobs and so on.",
            "Another issue with this amendment, Madam, is the resultant burden being too excessive for some, if not all, of the divorced wives with incapacitated spouses. This would be especially so for those with young children. It will definitely be doubly difficult for a wife to look after the children and also the long-term needs of the incapacitated ex-husband. In the past, the siblings or even the parents will take care of or share the care of the incapacitated spouses. With this Bill, this past norm of extended family's responsibility will be shifted to the ex-wife and thus the possibility of leaving the entire long-term care to her. Another point is that the extra long-term burden on the wife may indeed disadvantage her in getting into another relationship. It is because the potential new partner may not be comfortable with having his future wife supporting another person permanently.",
            "Putting the child's interest first in a divorce through Mandatory Parenting Programme for divorcing parents with children below 21 years is welcome indeed. Children do suffer from broken marriages through no fault of theirs. Studies have shown that children suffer from physical and psychological repercussions from the divorce of their parents. Such children are at a higher risk of social and psychological problems later in their adult lives.",
            "Studies have also shown that children whose parents are married throughout the early childhood years are less likely to suffer from breathing problems such as asthma, from becoming overweight and from being injured in accidents before they are five years of age. On the other hand, children troubled with parental divorce are particularly prone to develop problems with anger, disobedience, rule violations, prolonged sadness and even depression. Their performance in school can be adversely affected too. The emotional, social, health and economic costs associated with marital conflict and family dissolution causing delinquency, depression, poverty and crime and, especially, the devastating harm done to children have been well documented.",
            "The number of children below the age of 18 years who were affected by the divorce of their parents in 2014 was 5,172 and 1,689 for marriages under Women's Charter and Administration of Muslim Law Act respectively.",
            "May I ask Ministry for Social and Family Development (MSF) whether there is any support scheme, with professional assessment and assistance, in place to help especially the more vulnerable children during the transition stages of divorce proceedings? Most children are stressed and do not want their parents to divorce. Can school counsellors be roped in to assist and work with social workers of MSF to better help these children?",
            "According to studies by Amato & Keith in 1991, the long-term consequences of parental divorce for adult attainment and quality of life may prove to be more serious than the transitional short-term emotional and social problems in children. Stress states have been noted to be prolonged for many children, especially those in lower income families with financial instability following the divorce of their parents. Many children also have difficulty adjusting to new environments and perhaps new step-parents and step-siblings from any subsequent marriages.",
            "Is it possible for MSF to set up a register to keep track of vulnerable children from divorces and to assist these children, especially the more disadvantaged ones, on a long-term basis? I feel that this will be an important step to ensure keeping these children on MSF's radar in order to give them a better footing in life subsequently and thereby prevent future problems for themselves and for society.",
            "Concerning the new section 94A of the Bill on extending the Mandatory Marriage Preparation Programme to marriages where at least one party is a minor, I read it as MSF trying to apply the tenet of \"prevention is better than cure\". This is a good thing as divorces here are on the rise. The absolute number of divorces was 1,551 in 1980 and 6,861 in 2014, 7,307 including annulments. MSF had previously published that marriages involving younger grooms, regardless of the age of the brides, were particularly vulnerable to divorces. Thus, this Mandatory Marriage Preparation Programme may be useful in preventing divorces. I feel that we should particularly take the opportunity at this early stage to identify couples with high divorce potential and counsel them accordingly.",
            "Over the past two decades, the US government-funded researchers have declared that they can predict, with about 90% accuracy, which engaged couples will divorce. An early researcher in the field, regarded by many as its reigning genius, is John Gottman. Other researchers have developed programmes that can significantly change the odds for marriages that appear doomed.",
            "May I ask whether MSF can take this one step further and identify those marriages, where at least one party is a minor, that seem to be starting on wrong footings or having higher chances of divorce so as to, under this new section of 94A, proceed to mandate three more marriage counselling courses at the end of the first year, second year and fifth year of their marriages as well as mandate additional parenting tips for such couples should they have children by then? This will strengthen marriages more before they deteriorate or start to breakup. Thus, I am suggesting not just giving pre-marriage courses but three further subsequent marriage courses in communication, conflict resolution and marriage enhancements together with parenting courses for minors. Can MSF also set up a fund to make it easier for couples to have such courses without monetary constraints?",
            "Regarding section 57C, I agree that we should strengthen our regulations to avoid marriages of convenience. In our small country with limited resources, we cannot afford to allow this immigration loophole.",
            "Will MSF explore further preventive measures at the very beginning when requirements for marriages are being considered? When certain characteristics or signs, such as wide age gap, foreign bride and lower income, of a marriage of convenience exist, there should be extra measures in place to determine such applications. Madam, subjecting such couples to interviews or to filling-up questionnaires separately would be one such measure. Very often, conflicting answers to the same questions posed to such couples can give clues to such marriages of convenience.",
            "Could MSF facilitate better collaboration of the various ministries involved in order to enhance higher vigilance and detection?",
            "Can our registrars of marriages be given the authority to investigate and form opinions on whether the marriage applications are genuine and perhaps to refuse issuance of certificates for fraudulent marriages? Can the registrars or, for that matter, any other Ministries refer with ease any suspected cases of marriage of convenience to MSF or ICA for follow-up?",
            "Most times, it is the public or people in the community that is in the know about any marriages of convenience between couples. Therefore, we should try to make it easier and convenient for the public to inform on such couples so that the relevant Ministries can follow up. I hope MSF can further facilitate these areas.",
            "I also feel that publicity on our rules and punishments concerning marriages of convenience can be made clearer. This should especially target the nationals that frequently use this route to gain permanent residency here. Maybe our embassies in the countries of these nationals should publicise this information and help to discourage them from using this route to gain permanent residency in Singapore. Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I support the Bill."

          "content": [
            ": Mdm Speaker, this Bill takes steps to adjust the 55-year old legislation to the changing social environment affecting family life. When enacted in 1961, the Women's Charter was a momentous and courageous legislation that swam against the tide of opinions and the traditional values of society. I would like to remind the House that the traditional values of Asian society just 60 years ago was the patriarchal treatment of women and the widespread acceptance of polygamy. The preservation of the so-called traditional family was not the original intent of the Charter. On the contrary, the Women's Charter instituted the modern moral view of the family as a cooperative partnership between husband and wife who have equal rights as independent individuals and have equal responsibilities in caring and providing for the children.",
            "It is a waste that the present and recent amendments are cautious reactions to rising divorce rates. These were opportunities to replicate the visionary spirit of the framers of the original Charter in using the law to shape society for the empowerment of its members. The main changes proposed by the present Bill attempt to deal with two sets of problems besetting the modern family following the principles of the original Charter. The first set concerns the better protection of the well-being and interests of children and follows the principle of parental responsibility. The Bill gives the Courts powers to order divorcing parents to attend the Mandatory Parenting Programme (MPP) and restates who can apply for a protection order in situations of family violence. The second set follows the principle of gender equality and makes incapacitated ex-husbands eligible for receiving maintenance from their ex-wives. The proposed changes, each on their own and on the whole, do not go far enough to plug the widening cracks and empower the modern family in increasingly trying times.",
            "On the matter of parental responsibility and better protection of children, I would like to make four points. The first point is on the MPP. My worry is that divorcing parents would go through the motion of attending the MPP. To be effective, the MPP should be tailored to parenting in divorced situations targeting both custodial and non-custodial parents. It should be integrated with mandatory mediation and counselling of divorcing parents at the Child Focused Resolution Centre and should stretch across the pre-divorce and post-divorce periods.",
            "Furthermore, the MPP and the counselling should try to involve the children as much as possible. Children should not be treated simply as passive victims whose problems could be solved by positive parenting. Article 12 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child states that we should \"assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child\" and that these views be \"given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child\". In divorcing situations, children should be and could be active stakeholders whose participation in the process could help to protect their interests and help them achieve some emotional closure.",
            "The second point I would like to raise is that while parental courses, mediation and counselling are good soft solutions persuading couples to go through amicable divorce in the interest of their children, they do not solve the hard problem of ex-husbands defaulting on maintenance support. The 2011 amendments to the Charter giving the Courts powers to impose financial counselling, community service, attachment of earnings and credit bureau recovery have only managed to cause a dent in the problem. It has been reported that the number of applications for enforcement orders on maintenance had only dropped from 1,900 in 2009 to 1,700 in 2013. This means thousands of children remain at serious financial risk.",
            "Repeated stalling and refusal to pay maintenance could be the continuation of abusive relationships, specifically economic abuse to deprive other members of the family the sustenance to maintain a decent standard of living. The Charter continues to fail to recognise this as a form of family violence. Even if we allow that most ex-husbands who default on maintenance simply failed to put responsibility to their children as priority in their economic affairs, this goes against the Charter's core principle of equal parental responsibility. Whatever it is, the children suffer and may grow resentful of their parents.",
            "The principle of equal parental responsibility requires the law to make sure that the cost of recovery of maintenance does not reach unreasonable levels and is not laid on the single parent with custody of the children. There have been cases of mothers who have to drag their children to visit the Courts many times to get their maintenance, as they cannot afford legal representation. Many families end up in economic hardship because social service organisations are unable to help as long as the maintenance order is there to be enforced. The problem is precisely enforcement.",
            "This is not a new proposal, as women's organisations have proposed it previously. The Government can help tremendously vulnerable divorcee families to protect the interest of the children by setting up a central agency with strong enforcement powers to recover maintenance on behalf of the families. These powers could include intensive debt collection, investigative surveillance, litigation and overseas travel bans, as in the Australian example. A central agency, let us call it the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Families, could also serve another purpose, which is to provide support to divorcee families dependent on maintenance so that they would not fall into the poverty trap while waiting for the recovery of owed maintenance. The Commissioner for the Maintenance of Families could provide means-tested advance support capped at a quantum to meet basic needs while the owed maintenance is being recovered.",
            "My third point concerns maintenance for single unwed parents. The Charter could also give the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Families powers to take a proactive approach in helping single unwed parents, especially the mothers, to claim child maintenance from the biological father. This is in line with the principle of parental responsibility, as the onus for raising children out of wedlock should not fall on the women while men easily avoid taking responsibility. It is also important for the protection of the children since they are the ones who suffer most and should not be punished for the mistakes of their parents. Many single unwed mothers, because of their socio-economic background or due to the difficult situation of stigmatisation and isolation they are caught in, are not aware that they could apply for child maintenance from the fathers.",
            "If the worry is that helping single unwed parents will cause the moral hazard of promoting more children born out of wedlock, then the Government should know that studies have shown that enforcing child support for single unwed mothers, when coupled with widespread education and publicity, can reduce the rate of non-marital pregnancies. Enforcing men's parental responsibility has the knock-on effect of making men responsible in their overall behaviour towards women.",
            "My fourth point concerns the tackling of family violence. Is there any evidence that the \"Many Helping Hands\" approach has helped to reduce family violence? It seems that spousal violence, which makes up the majority of family violence cases, is taking place earlier in the first five years of marriage rather than in the later years of marriage. Family violence remains a pernicious problem. The Government's approach is to strengthen the touch-points that help identify family violence so that early intervention through counselling can be achieved. It is said that the legal route is not the best solution, so the Courts and applications for Personal Protection Orders (PPOs) should be the last resort.",
            "Notwithstanding this, access to the legal route is an important insurance to give victims a strong sense of security as well as provide an assured deterrence against repeated abuse. This Bill restates the persons who can apply for PPOs, which remain severely limited to the very victims of violence or the persons responsible for the victims if they are below the age of 21 years. However, women and mothers responsible for children being abused are often trapped in precarious positions of recurring violence. They often experience helplessness and cannot act to protect themselves and their families.",
            "We need to expand the range of persons empowered to apply for PPOs. Family members, relatives and friends who are explicitly authorised by the victims are in a good position to know when violence takes place and should be empowered to apply for PPOs. Doctors are also an important touch-point. Right now, the onus is on victims to tell doctors about abuse and request a report for possible PPO application. By the time the violence results in physical injury, it is at the critical stage. Doctors should be empowered to report cases to the Police and draw up medical reports without request. In many jurisdictions, mandatory reporting by doctors to law enforcement has helped to mitigate family violence.",
            "Other than the victims of abuse, children witnessing family violence are the worst affected. Most of them would try to intervene and a survey shows 10% called the Police. We need to protect the children and tweak the \"Many Helping Hands\" approach to allow children to become a trip-wire for early intervention.",
            "Last and definitely not least, like in many jurisdictions overseas, the Police, to whom social workers, doctors, victims and children of victims turn to as the trusted investigative and enforcement agency, should be empowered to apply for protection orders.",
            "Gender equality. Allowing incapacitated ex-husbands to claim maintenance from their wives is a belated concession to the principle of gender equality. The call to allow ex-husbands to apply for maintenance was first raised in 1996. The Government rejected it on grounds of tradition, that it is the duty of husband to maintain the wife. The same call was rejected six years ago on account that society is not ready for gender equality when it comes to maintenance. This is a double irony since the Women's Charter was enacted regardless of whether traditional polygamous society was ready for the modern nuclear family. Gender equality was enshrined in the Charter despite tradition or the readiness of society.",
            "Gender equality in 1961 meant giving women equal rights in marriage. Thus, the division of matrimonial assets must be made in \"just and equitable\" proportions giving due credit to non-financial contributions to marriage. Realising this principle of gender equality today means doing two things. Men should be given full rights to being eligible for maintenance and we should allow the Courts to make gender-neutral decisions regarding asset division and maintenance based on discernments of financial and non-financial contribution to the matrimonial household and also potential earning power. Second, the law should factor in opportunity cost in lost earnings due to being a homemaker in the determination of maintenance, especially given that men and women have full access to the labour market.",
            "In the same spirit of gender equality, but also because this is the hard reality today, we need to include boys and young male persons under Part XI, which protects women and girls from prostitution, sexual exploitation and trafficking. This Part is even more outdated than the Women's Charter as it reflects the old colonial Women and Girls' Protection Ordinance. The world in the 21st Century has changed, and as scandals regarding the sexual grooming and sexual trafficking of boys indicate, we need to update this Part urgently. In fact, Part XI is an anomaly and its inclusion in the Charter conflates prostitution and sexual exploitation with the family. I believe this Part is best taken out and its provisions integrated with the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act and the Penal Code.",
            "Once Part XI is removed, and the principles of parental responsibility and gender equality are re-affirmed, future revisions of the Women's Charter provides us with the opportunity to do something progressive and leading the times, shaping society for the better like what the original Charter did in 1961. There have been calls for the Women's Charter and all other legislations dealing with the family, including the Children and Young Persons Act, to be combined into a landmark piece called The Family Charter. I support this proposal. This is not just for the rationalisation of the law, but it will serve two important purposes.",
            "First, this Government has reiterated that its ideology and policy is to protect, preserve and promote the modern nuclear family as the bedrock of our society. We should continue to do so. Nowhere else in the law is the modern family so well and morally defined as in the Women's Charter, as equal cooperative partnership with independent rights and parental responsibility, which has paved the way for families to thrive for 50 years now. It is time to rename the Charter to enshrine even more visibly the ideology of safeguarding families.",
            "Second, the renaming does not just give symbolic effect to the moral view of the family. The Family Charter will form the basis with which we institutionalise the family further in the era of ageing, globalisation and consumption culture where the norm of non-marital unions and mixed family forms become increasingly prevalent. It will be the basis for positive legislation to empower children, men and women to lead healthy family lives if they so desire. It will signal to society that families are here to stay and that the Government is committed to protecting the vulnerable, especially when it comes to our children, to ensure that they do not suffer our failures.",
            "Mdm Speaker, we like to tell our children to emulate the bold and progressive spirit of our Pioneer political leaders. The Women's Charter is a testament to that spirit, but it is in need of a bold revision that would do justice to its core principles of gender equality and parental responsibility. The measures in this Bill try to do this, which is reason for me to support it, but they do not go far enough.",
            "There is no reason not to be bold. Treat children as stakeholders in the divorcing process, set up a central agency to help single-parent families collect maintenance, help single unwed mothers obtain child support to reduce poverty and wedlock pregnancies, tackle family violence by empowering the police and persons who can help the victims to apply for protection orders, allow all ex-husbands to apply for maintenance and let the courts decide on gender-neutral grounds, and consolidate the legislation as the Family Charter to establish a firm foundation for families to thrive into the 21st Century.",
            "The year 2021 will mark the 60th year of the enactment of the Charter. A bold revision will revive and honour the core principles of the Charter, and this Bill paves the way for the revision. All that is needed now is the courageous spirit. Thank you."

          "content": [
            ": Mdm Speaker, the Women's Charter is an important piece of legislation in Singapore. It was passed in 1961 to protect and advance the rights of women and girls in Singapore. At that time, the typical household division of labour was such that women would take care of the family at home, while men go out to work and bring the bread home. Many women, due to the lack of education and little control over or access to resources then, were often bullied and in worse instances, faced domestic violence. Therefore, I believe the Women's Charter passed in 1961 was a progressive and much needed piece of legislation.",
            "Fast forward more than 50 years to today, Singapore has progressed significantly and women today have made huge leaps on many fronts. Singaporean women today are driven and well educated. We are capable of holding our own at workplaces. And with jobs, this means that we are or can be financially independent, generally speaking. Moreover, we have also observed a small, but growing, group of men who give up their jobs to devote their full time to caring for their families. Therefore, it is timely to review the Women's Charter and update parts of the Charter to offer somewhat more gender balance. In this case, inserting a provision to allow men, very specifically incapacitated men who cannot work and support themselves, to apply for maintenance from their ex-wives is a step in the right direction.",
            "While we need to take bold steps and to recognise that the society has indeed progressed and evolved, and that there is greater gender equality that we observe now in our society, and that with that, I support the provisions in principle, I do have a few concerns that I hope that MSF can address.",
            "Firstly, what safeguards will the MSF put in place to ensure that even though the applicant is incapacitated and appears to be the weaker party, maintenance will be granted only on legitimate grounds? For instance, what if the applicant had not even contributed to the raising of the family before he was incapacitated?",
            "Secondly, how will MSF ensure that this provision will not overburden the ex-wives, who are also granted custody of their children precisely because they are now the more abled party? These ex-wives may be in financial difficulties themselves. They are also most likely the sole breadwinner supporting their children.",
            "Let me cite an example. I have a resident. Let us call her Mdm Foo. She has two young children, two sons still in Primary school. Her husband decided to divorce her for various reasons, but through no fault of hers. She has been working, she has been financially independent but her financial prowess and position were simply not strong enough for her to afford the payment of the home after the divorce because of the compulsory, mandatory requirement to sell off the matrimonial flat. And having custody of her two sons means she will have to take care of them. Yet, despite her being financially active, economically active throughout her working life, she was not even able to afford the extra $3,000 to settle the final payment for the home that she was desperately trying to secure in order to continue to provide a stable and normalised life, post-divorce.",
            "So, in the likes of Mdm Foo, in the event that her ex-husband happens to be incapacitated and would like to demand for maintenance from her, how would she be able to afford? This would no doubt impose too much a burden on the likes of Mdm Foo and, in turn, would also impose great burden and great stress, to the disadvantage to the young children.",
            "Thirdly, what about the divorced women today who are still not receiving their monthly maintenance? While the provision is a step in the right direction, I do urge MSF to continue to strengthen its implementation and support to the ex-wives who need but have yet to receive their monthly maintenance. Otherwise, while we may have moved a step forward on the gender equality front, we risk regressing a step backward in terms of protecting vulnerable women – the very group of people this Charter was enacted to protect in the 1960s. We must recognise and support the group of women who had sacrificed the prime of their lives to care for their families and raise their children and, as a result, left themselves in a very vulnerable position. This is made worse-off if they have to also take on the role of being a breadwinner to support their children.",
            "Fourthly, I would like to ask whether MSF would consider putting in requirements to demand for maintenance from the irresponsible person who may have impregnated a women resulting in her becoming a single and unwed mother.",
            "I say this because I have a resident whom I feel very sympathetic towards. I understand the controversy, issues and concerns that the general society may have towards unwed parents, but in this case, I have full sympathy towards this resident who is just a young lady. When she was much younger, she met a man who impregnated her and they had three children together. Every time she got pregnant, the man would promise to marry her, but every time that promise never gets realised. Finally, as she was pregnant with her third child, this man impregnated another woman and was getting ready to marry this other woman, leaving her in the lurch. This poor lady had to fend for herself and to take care of her three children whom she loves dearly.",
            "Thankfully, her own family is supportive but they too are in financial difficulties. They came to me in tears because they were very upset that this man is going to leave her in the lurch while he marries this other woman whom he felt more attracted to, or for whatever reasons, he felt more strongly about. The three children will now have to face the consequences and the fate of having to depend on only a single source of resources and that is the mother. This mother is really struggling on her own.",
            "In such instances, I feel very sorry for the three children. This is unfair and, therefore, I would like to ask whether MSF can do something to make a provision such that in such instances, the demand for maintenance from the very irresponsible parent will be made available to the single unwed parent who has to take care of the children. I think in this case, the focus is really on the welfare of the children; they are innocent and they too deserve to have an equal and good start in life because they too are born Singaporeans and they are the children of Singapore.",
            "Now, any end to a marriage can inflict great pain on both the man and woman who once loved each other and chose to be together till death do they part. However, if they have a family, the greatest pain is perhaps borne by their children. Children are born to their parents; they rely on, grow to love and share a deep bond with their parents. In a separation, children usually have no say in the decision and yet they are compelled to deal with the pain.",
            "Therefore, I am encouraged to hear that MSF is trying to better protect the interest of children affected by their parents' divorce through the Mandatory Parenting Programme. But besides targeting divorcing and divorced parents, are there efforts to enhance support for the children affected? Also, the Mandatory Parenting Programme is only for parties who cannot agree on the divorce or ancillary matters. What about divorcing couples who can agree on all matters? Their children will still be affected by their parents' separation. How will MSF help them?",
            "On a related note, I believe that ensuring the children have continued access to both parents is important to their development. However, in some acrimonious divorces, the custodian parent may find ways to disallow the other party's access to the children, despite the agreement made. In some cases, the custodian parent hovers around and makes it difficult for the visiting parent to spend quality time with the children. In some cases, the custodian parent and visiting parent continue to fight during the visitation period. And in some cases, the custodian parent simply hides the children and refuses to reveal their whereabouts to the visiting parent.",
            "There is another example that I came across at the Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS). The poor mother came crying to me because she could not have access to her two children as the father decided to smuggle the children out of Singapore to Malaysia. Since it is out of our jurisdiction in Singapore and she has no relatives or contacts there, she was at a total loss, not knowing where to find her children, but yet she misses them and wanted to make sure they are okay. These no doubt will only worsen the already detrimental impact on the children.",
            "Currently, I am glad to note that some Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) have taken the initiative to address this issue. Thye Hua Kuan, for example, has a Centre for Family Harmony at Circuit Road in MacPherson. I have visited the centre and have also come to understand the plights of some of these divorced parents. This centre allows supervised visitations so that despite a divorce, both parents can continue to be present and be a responsible father or mother to the child. In this respect, could MSF share whether such a service will be scaled up and whether MSF has other plans to complement such an effort?",
            "Finally, while I am encouraged by MSF's move to provide more protection and support to children affected by their parents' divorce, the ideal must be to build strong families in Singapore. As I have said earlier, the biggest victim in a divorce would be the children. Not only do they have to cope with the immediate pain and anxieties, instability and other adjustment issues, they also risk suffering longer term effects, such as trust and relationship problems in their adulthood. Hence, we must not subject innocent children to such pain as far as possible.",
            "There is another group, another category of Singaporean families that I feel we must continue to support as well – families with foreign parents. In most cases, there are genuine marriages involving a foreign spouse. While a marriage of convenience cannot be tolerated nor condoned, as it violates the sacredness of marriage, but we must do more to recognise and support genuine marriages with foreign spouses. Love cannot be ordained; nobody should tell us who we can or cannot marry. Hence, I believe that supporting a family in which most are Singaporeans, that means perhaps with a foreign parent, we are no doubt helping to build strong Singaporean families.",
            "Hence, I hope that MSF will continue its work in anchoring the ideal of strong families, and work closely with other Ministries to ensure that our policies help young couples build strong families that can stand the test of time.",
            "Some things the Government cannot and should not interfere, but some things the Government can do to try to facilitate and help. For instance, we can try to allow or facilitate couples getting access to flats in matured estates near their parents so that they can have parental and familial support when they eventually have children. This, set against the background where the demand for childcare is increasingly high, I believe, is important. This is just an example, but I hope that MSF can continue to work with the various agencies and Ministries to look at how we can better support and help our young Singaporean families take root in Singapore. At the end of the day, the foundation of a strong Singaporean society would be to continue to have strong families and therefore, helping them would no doubt help to build a stronger Singapore for the future.",
            "Madam, notwithstanding the concerns I have raised, I believe the amendments proposed to the Women's Charter are made in the right spirit. Hence, I support the proposed amendments to the Act."

But now after five years, more amendments are needed to fine-tune the Women's Charter, in view of the evolving needs of women and child.

The proposed amendments in the Bill are largely focused on five key areas: (i) taking care of the child/children's interests through the Mandatory Parenting Programme for divorcing parents; (ii) maintenance for incapacitated men; (iii) enhanced protection for women, and professionals at places of safety; (iv) voiding marriages of convenience; and (v) remote communications facilitating provision of sexual services.",
            "I will go through these one by one.",
            "Mandatory parenting programme. Mdm Speaker, in any divorce, to say that the child or children suffers the most is an under-statement. A broken home does no wonders to a child's self-confidence, esteem, educational development and health, and many studies attest to this.",
            "Divorce is a battle of attrition as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has rightly pointed out. Children are the losers as they bear the brunt of the collateral damage in any fight between father and mother. It is not fair to the children. Some may be more resilient and march on bravely in the face of a newly radicalised family environment but there are many more out there who are left broken, bitter by divorce. In many of the cases I have seen at MPS and at block visits, and I am sure many Members can attest to this, it is the children who need the most help.",
            "Over the years in various Parliamentary Questions, the MCYS and subsequently the MSF has provided various statistics on children affected by divorce. Between 2005 and 2009, an average of 6,025 divorces was filed at the Family Court and 1,780 at the Syariah Court. It was stated that half of Family Court's and 70% of Syariah Court's cases involved families with children and these figures continue to climb. Back then 4,700 and 2,600 for marriages Women's Charter and Administration of Muslim Law Act respectively, and the figure for 2014 has gone up even further.",
            "These are alarming figures indeed. One can only imagine the fate of the child pre and post-divorce. The mental and physical nature of the fights, the ensuing loneliness and ultimately the feeling of abandonment would have the child traumatised.",
            "According to a noted psychologist and researcher, Dr Judith S. Wallerstein, who carried out studies on the effects of divorce on the children over a 25-year period, \"Divorce is a life-transforming experience. After divorce, childhood is different. Adolescence is different. Adulthood – with the decision to marry, to have or have not children – is different. Whether the outcome is good or bad, the whole trajectory of an individual's life is profoundly altered by the divorce experience\".",
            "The Mandatory Parenting Programme under section 94A is a welcome move. Our current law requires parents with children under 21 years of age to attend mediation and counselling after a divorce writ is filed. But the proposed amendment makes it compulsory to attend the programme before filing for divorce; this is welcome. Through this Mandatory Parenting Programme one can only hope that the child's physical and mental needs are taken care of by both parents. The programme would be more fruitful if feuding parents could patch up after these counselling sessions, which should be introduced to those considering divorce.",
            "It is encouraging that the mandatory programme at the Child Focused Resolution Centre (CFRC) has been quite successful in helping divorcing couples focus on the best interests of their children. The Family Justice Courts' CFRC programme has been extended to cover all divorce cases with children below 21 years of age.",
            "But I would like to suggest and urge the Ministry to consider pushing this even further. To take a bold move which matches the historic impact of the Women's Charter and that is to move this Mandatory Parenting Programme upstream together with the Mandatory Marriage Preparation programme.",
            "Before I got married to my wife, we needed to attend a compulsory marriage preparation course call Engaged Encounter. Though it was just one weekend, it was intense and it was emotional. It made us realise that courtship and marriage are two very different kettles of fish. With the support of counsellors and experienced couples who journeyed with us, all of us \"junior\" couples had the opportunity to ask each other questions that would be too unromantic for courtship but all the more important for a life to be spent together.",
            "To be truthful, through the many marriage preparation courses that are available out there, there are couples who spilt up after attending the courses, but I feel this is for the better. I hasten to add that many of these whom I know remained friends with one another.",
            "With that in mind, I therefore strongly believe that just as courtship does not prepare you for marriage, a wedding does not prepare you for parenthood. So, a mandatory course will equip couples with the ability to stay together and raise a happy family together.",
            "On maintenance for incapacitated men, I feel this is an important step but I hope that at some point we reach parity beyond just providing for those who are incapacitated. As many Members before me have pointed out, it is not just for parity's sake but it also points to the fact that women in society have improved their social standing by leaps and bounds and this must be applauded.",
            "The late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, in his 1983 National Day Rally, mentioned that our economy is dependent on women and their contributions to Singapore and this is invaluable. He said: \"We've got to go one step beyond and try and fit in the problems in a new context. In other words, how do we so reshape our policies that we can educate them; that they will have full career opportunities that the valuable well-educated, whilst making a big contribution, will at the same time ensure their contribution to the next generation\".",
            "The generation that Mr Lee referred to so stirringly in that speech made more than 30 years ago, is this generation. Since then, women in Singapore have been breaking, in fact smashing the glass ceiling. The Women's Charter is about empowering our Singapore women and their financial standing has grown in tandem with their contributions to our nation from bread-makers in the kitchen to breadwinners in this generation for their families.",
            "This amendment also finally lays to rest the anomaly of Section 46 of the same Charter, which states that both husband and wife are both \"mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union and in caring and providing for the children\" and under Section 46(4), \"have equal rights in the running of the matrimonial household\". Before this amendment, there was mutual obligation under the Charter but not when deciding maintenance. This amendment will also put an end to the dysfunctional carryover from common law that will fully restore equality to women in marriage.",
            "Although such an amendment to the Women's charter was not considered in 1996 nor subsequently in 2011, this is an important first step. I however hope that at some point we reach parity just beyond, as I mentioned, providing for those who are incapacitated.",
            "Therefore in all fairness, if the wife is earning more, maintenance payments to incapacitated ex-husbands must be in order. I would however like to know if the Ministry could share - if available - the number or estimated number of incapacitated ex-husbands in Singapore who would benefit from this proposed amendment.",
            "What are the parameters as well, as alluded to by the hon Member Ms Tin Pei Ling, to determine the level of incapacity and how will ex-husbands be deemed to be fully incapacitated? I hope the Ministry would shed more light in this area.",
            "An upgrade from the proposed single MRO under the set of amendments, as mentioned by the Minister earlier, is a suggestion to set up a formal Tribunal, akin to the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents, to free the Courts and to determine and enforce maintenance payments for both ex-husbands and ex-wives. The late Mdm Chan advocated for Marriage Counselling Courts in 1959, this came only to fruition in 1995 with the setting up of the Family Justice Courts. I do hope that while maintenance for husbands took 19 years and the family courts took 36 years to find realisation, it will not take another similar length of time before a Tribunal is considered.",
            "With regards to enhanced protection for women, and professionals at places of safety, According to a 2013 report on the International Violence Against Women Survey (IVAWS) conducted in Singapore, the prevalence of violence against women in Singapore shows that nearly one in ten of the 2,006 female respondents surveyed, or 9.2%, reported having experienced at least one incidence of violence by a man in their adult lifetime, since the age of 16.",
            "These findings of course showed that over one-third of victimised women, or 35.8%, received some injuries during the most recent incidents.",
            "I believe that for some their ordeal does not end there. The Minister in his proposed amendment has indicated that in certain circumstances, women and children can be placed in the care of a fit personnel. But in cases like these where they are not placed in places of safety such as a residential care home or a crisis centre, will their safety be compromised, because they do not have a proper set up for security measures.",
            "These places of safety are supposed to offer a sanctuary to abused women and girls. And if this sanctuary fails to provide the promised protection, we will be deemed to have failed in our duty.",
            "With regards to voiding marriages of convenience, it is timely that deterrent action has been taken to reign in the numbers of sham marriages. The numbers of those convicted have gone down – from 284 in 2013 to 170 in 2014. This is a positive development.",
            "The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has mentioned that the women in some of these marriages are sex workers or are made to prostitute themselves after the so-called legalities of the sham marriage.",
            "Under the amendment proposed in this Bill, would a statutory declaration be enough to further deter such sham marriages. Agreed, it will void the marriage of convenience but more proactive action is perhaps required by the respective agencies, in ensuring that the matchmakers involved in bringing over foreign brides are",
            "bona fide",
            "and are not mere pimps in disguise, masquerading as arrangers of marriages of convenience.",
            "With regards to remote communication, facilitating provision of sexual services under the new section 146, I would like to seek clarification from the Minister on how the Ministry will deal with sites that are posted overseas? A simple Google search will reveal that there are many such sites but there are no provisions under section 146 for this.",
            "Mdm Speaker, we have come a long way since the original Women's Charter was passed in 1961. Women form the core of a family and are the pillars of strength of society. They have contributed much and will contribute even more, as the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew has stated. This is one Bill that has brought by-partisan support from across different parties. It is therefore incumbent upon us to honour and treasure this Charter and timely that we make the necessary amendments so that it protects not only women but their families, and marriages too. In the words of Mdm Chan Choy Siong, in her opening remarks on the debate on the Women's Charter, \"[The Women's Charter] will bring about revolutionary change in society.\"",
            "I believe that this Charter continues to be revolutionary and all the more so with these amendments. I would not call them belated, but perhaps a timely evolution. While we make small steps with each amendment, women have taken giant leaps forward and therefore in this context, Mdm Speaker, I support this Bill."

          "speaker": "Ms Rahayu Mahzam",
          "content": [
            ": Thank you, Mdm Speaker. At the outset, I would like to declare that I am a family lawyer. In my practice, I have assisted many clients in their divorce proceedings. One of the issues that is usually very difficult for couples to deal with is the arrangements in relation to the custody, care and control and access of the children upon divorce. We have often heard stories of how the children become embroiled in their parents' acrimonious battles in Court and become emotional pawns in the situation. The Minister earlier alluded to some examples.",
            "I have also encountered first-hand parties who let their children read their affidavits and those of their soon-to-be former spouse on the pre-text that the children should know what is happening. Or those who make their children write notes or letters to Court to say that they do not want to be with the other parent.",
            "In my view, such actions are harmful to the children's mental development in the long run. The negativity which the parents show towards each other can have a traumatic impact on the children and usually, these children are unable to voice out their emotions to the parents. I recall a Family Court Judge sharing in one of the lectures I attended some years back. As adults, when we are unhappy or stressed, most of us can reach out for help, talk about our emotions with our family and friends. However, children may not be able to articulate their emotions as well and may not even have the opportunities to do so. Therefore, the divorce process should be child-centric and protect the interests of the children.",
            "I would often advise my clients to try to put aside their grievances when it comes to matters relating to their children and always give paramount interest and consideration to their children. For the parents, this is actually easier said than done. I have come to realise that most times, parties are too caught up with their emotions to be able to think rationally in the situation. They are angry, hurt and sometimes even vengeful. It is important to put them in the right state of mind before they begin their divorce proceedings.",
            "Over the years, there have been many developments at the Family Court to gradually introduce mandatory counselling and mediation for parties with young children. Parents are encouraged to resolve the issues on custody, care and control and access as early as possible. I am pleased to see further developments in the form of the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter, in particular the addition of the new section 94A to prescribe a Parenting Programme for appropriate parties before the commencement of divorce proceedings. I believe that the introduction of a Parenting Programme will be useful to remind parents of the impact of divorce on their children and the need to prioritise their children's interests in their decisions.",
            "I note that in the proposed section 94A, provisions are made for exemptions from the Parenting Programme. This is clearly necessary as such programmes may not be relevant for divorcing parties who do not have children and there is also some room for the Court to make appropriate orders in certain circumstances, for example, when a case needs to be expedited where there is domestic violence. I would like to seek clarification though on the phrase \"excluded party\" at the proposed section 94A sub-section 3(b) and the group of people who would fall into this category, aside from those without children. I think it is useful to clarify the intent of excluding certain groups from the Parenting Programme, especially if we want to ensure that as many parents as possible are educated about the impact of divorce on their children.",
            "The intent of introducing a Parenting Programme is clearly noble. However, for the initiative to be truly successful, the Parenting Programme itself must be effective. In implementing this programme, I hope attention will be given to develop a curriculum that goes to the core of the problem and is going to be useful for the parents. I thank the Minister for earlier giving an insight into some of the items that would be covered in the programme. Such programmes should address the parents' needs, cater to the various family situations and be simple enough to be understood by all.",
            "I would like to add that the execution of this programme is important, otherwise it will be seen as just another procedure that the parties would have to go through to obtain their divorce. In fact, the Minister mentioned that there were concerns raised during the public consultation exercise.",
            "I would like to highlight that there must be sufficient capacity to schedule parties for programmes in a timely manner so that the divorce proceeding is not delayed. If there are insufficient slots, for example, parties would have to wait before they can attend the programme and they may be delayed in filing their divorce papers. This can cause angst and frustration amongst the already stressed and highly emotional couples. Divorce is an agonising process and we should not delay or complicate the procedures unnecessarily.",
            "In keeping with making the divorce process more child-centric, I also welcome and appreciate the proposed amendments to section 50 of the Women's Charter. Where children are involved, whether they like it or not, couples will continue to be in a long-term relationship. An adversarial Court process can be damaging to parties and, in particular, their children. It is, therefore, important to have processes that in some way \"heal\" parties to help them cope with the situation.",
            "I believe that counselling and mediation are key \"healing\" processes. It is useful to extend the variety of such processes. I note that section 50 also extends to all proceedings under the Women's Charter. These involve disputes between families, between spouses or former spouses, between siblings and between parent and child. Familial relationships cannot be terminated and family members who are in dispute need processes which help to repair their relationships. I, therefore, support the proposal to empower the Court to also direct parties or their children to attend family support programmes and activities in appropriate circumstances.",
            "The Family Court has, over time, taken a lot of effort in developing many aspects of the Family Justice System, including having mediators specially trained in family mediation. We need to continue building the family justice ecosystem. In particular, for divorce, we need to continue on the existing efforts of developing specialised lawyers who are equipped with appropriate knowledge and skills to handle divorces and other family disputes. Specialised lawyers can promote collaborative divorce, which encourages parties to discuss and resolve their disputes amicably. When parties can resolve matters on their own and avoid litigation, there is a greater chance that the relationship can remain cordial and their children are spared from the acrimony.",
            "I would, lastly, like to touch on the proposed amendments to sections 69 and 113 of the Women's Charter. These amendments relate to the extension of maintenance to an incapacitated husband or former husband, a point which has been raised by fellow Members of this House.",
            "I thank the Minister for sharing the spectrum of views garnered during the public consultation. I personally have some concerns about the call for allowing husbands in general, or former husbands, to claim maintenance from their wives. Yes, as a divorce lawyer, I also have male clients, and some have indicated unhappiness with the current regime in the Women's Charter. I acknowledge that while many Singaporean women have made good progress, this has not been uniform across all groups of women.",
            "While the Ministry takes steps to keep pace with societal changes, I believe there is a need to recognise that the majority of women still lag behind their male counterparts, especially financially. A wife is more likely to have given up her career or job advancement, to care for the family. Very often, we still see the traditional dynamics of the woman being the principal care-giver to her children, even when both husband and wife are working. So, post-divorce, such women are financially usually more vulnerable.",
            "I, therefore, appreciate that the proposed changes are calibrated, nuanced and limited to incapacitated husbands. It is important that we move towards addressing gaps in the law, addressing their grievances for these husbands who may have difficulties in maintaining themselves. However, I think it is important to be cautious of any further move to allow husbands to claim maintenance from their wives, at this juncture.",
            "Currently, I believe there is still some way to go in developing parity of financial status between men and women, especially across various income levels. The developments in the law, while it should be robust, need to be relevant and reflect the current state of affairs in society.",
            "I am of the view that it is lofty to think that we should advocate gender equality without testing it against the actual realities of the society today. I am, therefore, grateful and heartened that most of the proposed changes are dynamic and in tandem with societal developments. I welcome and support the proposals in this Bill."

            ": Madam, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill. The Women's Charter was enacted in 1961 with the intent to protect and advance the rights of women and girls in Singapore. It included regulations on the relationship between husband and wife, and the relationship between parents and their children, termination of marriages, division of matrimonial assets and maintenance. The Women's Charter also provides protection against family violence and penalty for offences against women and girls. Several amendments have been made since 1961, with the latest amendment made in 2011 to strengthen the enforcement of maintenance orders, provide improved support to those affected by divorces, as well as address emerging trends on marriages and divorce.",
            "The changes to the Women Charter, as proposed in the Bill tabled for today's Reading are positive, they are up-to-date, and do take into account the changing realities in the family in Singapore.",
            "Section 94A mandates that divorcing couples with children who cannot agree on all matters of divorce will need to attend a parenting programme before they can file for divorce. Like many who have spoken before me, I think this is a very important step as it does take the interest of the child that is involved in the divorce, at the centre. The Minister has shared that much of the content of this programme is around the care of the child, housing and schools, which are very important. But I do want to ask for more elaboration on the duration of the Mandatory Parenting Programme. The amendment also indicates that the person appointed to conduct the parenting programme will determine whether any person that attends the programme has completed the programme. Although an appeal against the determination can be made to the Minister, what measures will be put in place to ensure that the primary objective of protecting the interest of the children involved is met and that the case can be resolved effectively?",
            "I would like to touch on the maintenance for incapacitated men. The amendment proposed in sections 69 and 113 of the Bill is to allow incapacitated husbands or ex-husbands to claim spousal maintenance from their wife or ex-wives if they are incapacitated during the marriage to the extent that he is unable to work to support himself and at the time of the application for the maintenance is heard.",
            "I feel that this amendment is fair as it recognises the support expected of husband and wife during times of illness and disability. This is in line with the spirit of the Women's Charter, as outlined in the Rights and Duties of Husband and Wife in Part VI, clause 46, where it says that \"Upon the solemnisation of marriage, the husband and the wife shall be mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union and in caring and providing for the children.\"",
            "I have personally seen several cases during my MPS where wives have left their husbands after they were diagnosed with serious illnesses like cancer and they were left with no means to support themselves. This amendment, however, does assume that the wife has an income and the means to be able to afford the maintenance. This may or may not always be the case. And as the wife will most likely need to provide for the children as the husband is incapacitated, this may also put a heavy financial strain on her, even if she is working. We must also recognise that many women do make career choices to either slow down their careers or even leave their jobs for some period of time, if not permanently, when they have young children. This does disrupt their career, re-entry to the workforce, as well as their income. The Court, in deciding whether to order the wife to provide maintenance for her husband, I do hope will take into account her financial circumstances and the need to provide for herself and her children.",
            "Regarding protection for women, girls and residents at places of safety, and professionals engaged in protection work, while all of us are talking about the progress that we see in Singapore, I think the Bill recognises the need for protection of vulnerable women and girls. The sad reality is that they do need protection as their abusers are usually their family members.",
            "Based on a study done by PAVE in 2013, the most common form of family violence in Singapore is spousal abuse victims and these victims who are physically or psychologically abused by their spouses made up 72% of all new cases. The study also discovered that while victims of spousal abuse came from all age groups, the majority are females in their 30s and 40s. The study also found that spousal victims and abusers were better educated. As the abusers in these cases are men, they will be, in all probability, considerably physically stronger than them, and, as they are family, they will have also emotional control over the women. Thus, a shelter or safe place which provides for their requisite safety is imperative for them, not just to ensure that they are physically safe, but that they are also given peace of mind to pick up the pieces so that they can continue with their lives. They do need reassurance that their abusers will not be able to locate them when they are having sanctuary in shelters.",
            "The",
            "Straits Times",
            "news article by Janice Tai published in November 2013 on the study also helped to give some insight on the rise of family violence. I quote: \"The worsening problem of family violence can be seen by the rise in the number of such cases that went to court. In 1995, the Family Court heard 978 such cases. By last year, the figure had more than tripled to 3,200.\"",
            "Recognising the realities and the increasing use of social media, the amendments made in sections 177A and 153 seek to protect the identity of vulnerable women and girls and persons in protection work and, hence, ensuring their safety. Section 177A also prohibits the publication or broadcast of any information in the mass and social media that would reveal or is likely to identify the location of the shelter or residential facility or their residents. This will prevent perpetrators of violence from harassing, intimidating or harming the persons residing and working at these places. This amendment does provide for the State to also take action against serious breaches that would compromise the safety of residents and staff. Section 153 is also amended to extend prohibition on the publishing of information which may lead to the identification of women and girls in certain in-camera Court proceedings to also include online media and social media.",
            "There has been much discussion today around the question, \"Do we still need the Women's Charter?\"",
            "When the Women's Charter was passed in 1961, the intent was to protect the rights of women. We must recognise that, since then, there has been much progress made in Singapore and we have seen strong advancement of women; from education to their participation in the workforce. Some may then argue that there is not a need for the Women's Charter or that this is discriminating against men.",
            "I agree that there has, indeed, been great progress in the advancement of women in Singapore in education, health, employment and income. However, there are still several areas that women lag behind men. Many of our hon Members have touched on this, and this includes salary, labour force participation, especially in the economically productive years, in senior management, in decision-making roles in organisations, including Boards. While we are all seeing a trend in Singapore of men increasingly playing a bigger role in the family and involvement in care giving, in the majority of households, women still play the primary care-giver role.",
            "In Singapore, there are almost the same numbers of men and women attending university and obtaining degrees. But we still do, however, see many women leaving the workforce to take care of their children and family members. There are still fewer women in senior leadership roles in organisations as compared to men. While we see greater participation in the workforce, and the numbers have been very encouraging especially in the last few years − the female labour force participation rate rose significantly from 51.3% in 2004 to 58.6% in 2014 − but if we actually look at the female labour force participation of women aged 25 years to 39 years, this has dropped significantly as compared to the total number of women and single women labour force participation.",
            "So, it is likely that these women left their work during their prime years in their career to take care of their children and family. We are also seeing greater participation of husbands in the home, as I have shared earlier, and some have even chosen to be stay-at-home parent. However, while this trend will likely increase, for now, women continue to take on a greater role and family caring responsibilities.",
            "The Women's Charter is more than just about the relationship between husband and wife and that of between parents and their children, and division of matrimonial assets when marriages fail. There are still vulnerable groups of women and girls that need protection. So, I believe that there is continued relevance of the Women's Charter in Singapore today. The amendments proposed in this Bill are balanced and seek to recognise the spirit of the Women's Charter while addressing the changing realities in society and the family. Madam, I support the Bill."

            "With the latest amendments, I find it encouraging and progressive that, amongst other things, the proposed amendments will include allowing for incapacitated men to seek spousal support from their ex-wives. I believe the numbers to be small, though the Ministry does not reveal the figures of those that may be impacted. Moreover, the Court will still take into consideration the financial ability of the woman first before deciding if her ex-spouse is legally entitled to maintenance from his wife. I think this is the right thing to do.",
            "Mdm Speaker, today, I would like to speak about two red herrings on this issue. I am mindful that it is still mostly women and their children who need help to recover maintenance/alimony fees from their ex-husbands. Hence, the critics of this Bill who say that we should be more concerned about this larger group rather than the smaller one, I think, missed the point. First, the amendment does not change this level of help. Second, the group may be small, but their cause is no less just.",

            "In 2014, 10,200 male Singaporeans and permanent residents cited \"family responsibilities\", such as childcare, care-giving to family members and housework, as the main reason for not working. This is triple the number from 2006. One thousand and six hundred of them cited childcare as the main reason for being out of the workforce − more than double the number in 2006. Again, this is the minority, and 47,000 or 25% of females aged 25 to 54 cited childcare for their not being in the labour force.",
            "In parallel, labour force participation rate since 2011 increased more for women (from 55% to 60%), versus men (from 75% to 77%). The gap is still there, but it is steadily narrowing over 30 years. Certainly, nothing wrong nor surprising with these trends. Empirically, the argument is irrefutable. First, there are increasing role reversals. Second, the economics of home care and paid work follow this reversal. And when it comes to recompense, men should not be unjustly denied.",
            "Mdm Speaker, I do not want to belabour this argument because the moral reasoning is simple. But somehow in more than 30 years, it has not been able to get through this House.",
            "Back in 2011, it was raised in Parliament that role reversals were increasingly common; the wife takes on the sole breadwinner and the husband stays behind to take care of the house and family. If the couple were to divorce, the husband should be allowed to claim maintenance from the woman.",
            "In that year, that is, 2011, in response to calls for gender equality for men to be able to claim maintenance from women, the then-Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, said, and I quote, \"14 years ago, the Select Committee said we were not ready yet. I am afraid at this point in time, the answer is still we are not ready yet. I hope it will not take another 14 years but I am sure every time we review the Women's Charter, this question will arise.\"",

This year, we mark the 55th anniversary of the Women's Charter, a piece of legislation made for a time when women needed special protection. Such protection remains needed today. Perhaps in another 55 years, at a time of true equality, we would not need such a Charter. But until then, let us make the law a little more equal, by offering men the same protection as women. In the eyes of the law at least, we all ought to be equal. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill."

            "In particular, I believe that special consideration should be given to cases of domestic violence. I understand from AWARE that their experience is that the abused spouse is usually the one who wants the divorce whereas the abusive spouse may resist. In this situation, since the couple would not have agreed on divorce and all ancillary matters, according to the proposed amendment, they would have to go through Mandatory Parenting Programme unless this is dispensed with by the Court.",
            "I am concerned that the abused spouse could end up being trapped in a legally perpetuated situation of domestic violence. This will not be in the interest of the child as, in addition to spousal abuse, there may also be child abuse in such a situation.",
            "Although the proposed section 94A(4) allows Court's discretion in waiving the requirement of the Mandatory Parenting Programme, in my view, the law should explicitly and clearly state that no parenting programme needs to be attended in cases of domestic violence, rather than leaving the question up to the discretion of the judge.",
            "Second, on Spousal Maintenance for Men, which many Members have spoken about. The Bill amends the Charter so that spousal maintenance is available to men, but only where they have been incapacitated and are unable to support themselves. I believe that spousal maintenance should be based on the principle of fairness, rather than gender. Maintenance should also be available to men in other appropriate cases, for example, where men make economic sacrifices to take a primary role in household labour and caregiving, even if such cases are rarely encountered.",
            "Third, Violence against Women. At the moment, section 160 allows the Director of Social Welfare to detain girls aged between16 and 21 years on the following grounds: (i) if her lawful guardian requests the Director to detain her; (ii) if the Director considers her to be in need of protection and whose lawful guardian cannot be found; (iii) if the Director believes her to have been ill-treated; and lastly, (iv) if the Director considers her to be in moral danger.",
            "Is there any investigation of the \"lawful guardian\" who makes such a request? Is the girl in question consulted about her own needs or wishes?",
            "The underlying assumption is that the \"lawful guardian\" always has the girl's best interest at heart: this would not be true in situations of family violence.",
            "Even if the lawful guardians have their charges' best interests in mind, after the girl has been brought into detention, the Director can detain her until 21 years old, according to the amendment, and the guardian would have no control. It is problematic that girls can be detained against their will when they have not committed any criminal offences and, in fact, are in vulnerable situations at times.",
            "The provisions of sections 160, 161 and 163, even after the amendment, are still overly vague, broad and open-ended. There is still no clear information about the Director of Social Welfare's decision-making process concerning whether or not to bring a girl into detention, how long to detain her and what the conditions of her detention should be. What are the factors and criteria used for decision-making?",
            "I hope that we can have more explicit definitions of the conditions under which minors may be placed in protective shelters, including domestic violence as one of these conditions.",
            "I also hope that there will be submissions of the decisions of the Director of Social Welfare, with justifications, to the Family Court with a court review and a court order required for continuation of protective shelter to the woman or girl at risk, with the duration of the stay stipulated as well. At the end of the period of stay, the case should be reviewed by the Court.",
            "On the PPO regime, I note the amendment to section 65 to allow married or previously married persons below the age of 21 years to apply for a protection order and expedited order for themselves and specific dependents. This is commendable, but it does not follow that a wife under 21 with her dependents can easily find shelter in a place of safety.",
            "Will shelters for victims of domestic violence now accept married girls and women under 21? If not, what provisions are there for a wife who is under 21 and a victim of domestic violence to be housed in a place of safety?",
            "In addition, I suggest that other than those who are married, all individuals under 21 be allowed to apply for Personal Protection Orders (PPO) and Domestic Exclusion Orders (DEO) so that they can be protected from all forms of domestic violence, that the need for parental consent be removed in such cases and that the application for protection can be made against anyone in their household.",
            "Lastly, on Marriages of Convenience. I seek more clarity as to the process by which a marriage would be found void under the proposed new section 11A. The new section 11A(3) makes it clear that marriages will be deemed void if certain immigration offences are committed, but are there other circumstances in which section 11A would be invoked? If so, is there a court process involved or is it just an administrative determination? In my view, a decision of such gravity should be subject to judicial process.",
            "In conclusion, I am recommending the following:",
            "First, amend the new section 94A to explicitly state that in situations of domestic violence, Judges should not require divorcing parties to attend a Mandatory Parenting Programme.",
            "Second, make spousal maintenance available regardless of gender, on the basis of fairness and need.",
            "Third, section 160 allows the Director of Social Welfare to detain girls aged between16 and 21 years is extremely vague, broad and open-ended. I seek more clarifications on this and also for the submission of the decisions of the Director of Social Welfare under this section to be reviewed by the Family Court.",
            "Fourth, I note the extension of the PPO regime to married under-21s and would like to raise the question of whether these people will now be able to access shelters and \"place of safety\" if they become victims of domestic violence.",
            "Fifth, I recommend that all individuals under 21, not just those who have been married, can apply for PPOs on their own behalf.",
            "Sixth, I seek more clarity as to the process by which a marriage can be found void and whether a decision of such gravity will be subject to judicial process.",
            "Madam, I do feel that the proposed amendments are appropriate and timely. We, however, cannot legislate everything. Legislation is only one piece of the puzzle. There are also policies, support programmes and services and public education. They are all part of the overall effort. Family and community also have a strong role to play in strengthening and supporting families. Madam, my request for the Government to review the above points I raised, notwithstanding, I support the Bill."

            ": Mdm Speaker, I thank Members for the robust and heartfelt debate and especially for the support of the Bill and the direction in which we are going.",
            "Like many Bills and policies, all of us would like more to be done. Some of us would feel that we could go further, especially on matters such as maintenance of men, marriages involving minors and enhancing maintenance enforcements for wives, ex-wives and children.",
            "These are options we considered but as I mentioned, societal attitudes, while changing in the directions of which many of you highlighted, are also not uniform. From our consultations, it was clear that there were a fair number of Singaporeans who will feel that it would be too fast and too far if we move further at this stage. This is the dilemma. On one hand, while some of us may feel that to make some of these important changes represents a bold direction, but I think it is also about being effective, being relevant and calibrating the different sensitivities involved because a lot of these issues are in many ways emotive.",
            "I would like to thank Mr Louis Ng for highlighting that it is really an entire effort. Legislation is an important part but it is not everything, because you cannot legislate everything. What we plan and what we do intend to do and carry out is, to make sure that where there are needs to be met, the needs will have to be addressed. It need not be addressed fully necessary by legislation itself, but programmes, services to be there. And especially, as highlighted, family and community play a very important part as well.",
            "I would also like to highlight that this idea of a Family Charter, was something our Ministry has looked at as well. It is something, as pointed out by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, that we keep on the table. We have looked at it intently, and as we have mentioned, there are different views on how we should interpret this.",
            "But what I would like to highlight is this: the emphasis on the family remains. Just because we do not call it a Family Charter does not in itself mean that we are not placing emphasis on the family. For all intents and purposes, the bulk of what we are setting out in the Women's Charter is aimed at supporting families, and moreover, whilst the Act is so named, its provisions are in fact gender-neutral, except in the areas of maintenance – which many Members have raised your views on as well – protection of women and girls, vice, prostitution activities. In other areas of the law, others are also covered. For example, boys are covered under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act and also under Children & Young Persons Act (CYPA).",
            "We noted the points raised and this is something that we will continue to review as time goes by. We have made important changes. The Women's Charter, when it was first launched, was a landmark Charter. Over the years, important changes have been made. This time round, important changes are being made as well.",
            "While in some areas, we are taking calibrated steps forward, society, like I said, is not static. We will continue to monitor how society evolves, we will continue to consult and we will continue to look at the suggestions and ideas brought up by many Members. We do not preclude future changes.",
            "Let me move on to some of the specific points raised in the debate.",
            "Members have given their support to mandate marriage preparation programme for minor couples. Mr Alex Yam suggested that these young couples also attend a parenting programme. Indeed, the mandatory marriage preparation programme covers aspects of parenting. It also helps the couple to understand how their relationship will evolve when they start a family and have children. If the bride is expecting, grandparents are also invited to join in as extended family support is critical to the soon-to-be young parents.",
            "Dr Lily Neo would be pleased to know that our enhanced marriage support framework will also help young couples to address challenges during their marriage. This includes link-ups to appropriate parenting programmes and support.",
            "Many Members expressed empathy for children caught in the middle of their parents' divorce.",
            "Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Ms Jessica Tan spoke on the importance of child-centricity, and I really could not agree more. This is why we want to amend the Women's Charter to require parents contemplating divorce to attend the Mandatory Parenting Programme. Dr Lily Neo shared about the negative impact on children and highlighted the need for assistance to ensure that children do not fall through the cracks.",
            "My Ministry appointed the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies to provide a continuum of care to divorced families. There is a very strong child-centric focus.",
            "I would like to thank Ms Rahayu Mahzam for sharing with us her experiences on the realities of what actually happens. Many of us come into contact with such cases as well, either through friends or the residents we meet.",
            "I think it is important that children remain the centre of our efforts. Giving voice to children comes in many ways but we need to be careful because as we all know, sometimes in an acrimonious divorce process, children become part of the game. They are being pitted, back and forth, between the couples. That can be very disturbing and can have a tremendous impact on the children.",
            "What we want to make sure is that throughout the whole process, the children's interests are looked after. We want to make sure that they can undergo individual counselling. They may also attend an evidence-based programme called \"Children-In-Between\", which equips children with the skills to manage their feelings and develop resilience. Parents are also asked to attend, so that they reinforce the skills learnt by their children. Some of the stories I shared were very much surfaced through some of these processes where the children are encouraged to speak up so they could articulate their concerns and the things that trouble them.",
            "Since the programme started in 2015, close to 150 children and their parents have benefited. The overwhelming majority – about 96% – reported a reduction in stress. But that is not something that we take for granted; it is something that we need to continue to work on.",
            "Ms Jessica Tan asked for some details of the divorce support programmes. I will just very quickly run through how we are approaching it. We have four Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (DSSAs). The Mandatory Parenting Programme will include a couple of things: to make sure that there are considerations on financial challenges involved; housing and living arrangements in a divorce; child custody and child access; and joint agreement on a workable parenting plan.",
            "There are face-to-face sessions. There are also counselling made available to rebuild the marriage and, as mentioned earlier, the \"Children-in-Between\" programme. There is also a Parenting PACT which is a consultation session for divorced parents with minor children, designed to help parents understand the impact of a divorce on their children, learn co-parenting strategies and so on. There is a whole range of support being brought to bear, before filing for divorce, during the whole process itself and thereafter. We will be quite happy to explore other measures that we can put in place to support families in this process.",
            "Mr Louis Ng suggested that the Mandatory Parenting Programme should be automatically waived for victims of family violence in order to expedite the divorce proceedings and highlighted the particular profile of the families undergoing these difficulties.",
            "I think there is even greater need for these divorcing parties to be directed to receive help. We have measures in place to minimise the risk to victims of abuse.",
            "Firstly, families facing family violence will attend this programme at the Family Violence Specialist Agencies where the staff are trained to handle cases involving family violence. Secondly, in cases where it is beneficial to the family and child for divorce proceedings to be expedited, section 94A(4) empowers the courts to allow divorce proceedings to continue even when the parent has not completed the programme.",
            "The idea is that while we do recognise the challenges that families face when violence occurs, we also recognise that these families need help and to intervene where we can. We also make sure that clauses are available, steps are available for families to be assisted even when this violence is perpetuated and continues to be perpetuated.",
            "Another area that garnered much interest was spousal maintenance. Members have put forth a wide spectrum of views. Members such as Mr Seah Kian Peng, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and Mr Louis Ng spoke about moving towards a more gender neutral approach. I hear you. I fully understand because we do see instances where there might seem to be a compelling need to move along these grounds while on the other hand, as I have highlighted, there are also other views.",
            "Ms Rahayu Mahzam expressed her concerns against it, reminding us that many women are still vulnerable. Her sentiments echoed a",
            "The Straits Times",
            "commentary in October last year which was titled \"A Reality Check in Gender Equality\". Let me quote:",
            "\"Given the reality – supported by surveys – that the burden of care for children and the elderly still falls largely on the shoulders of women, the current law remains relevant.\"",
            "I think attitudes are changing. They are gradually shifting towards greater gender neutrality, but we believe at this stage, it is best to not rush and force the pace.",
            "I also heard concerns about extending maintenance to incapacitated husbands such as those shared by Ms Tin Pei Ling. The scenario of a woman of lesser means struggling to support herself and the children is a big concern. What more if such a woman had to maintain her incapacitated ex-husband. To reiterate, the incapacitated husband must meet all the criteria set out before he can apply for maintenance from the wife.",
            "Even if all these criteria are met, it does not mean that the husband or ex-husband will automatically be entitled to maintenance. Dr Lily Neo expressed concerns for women who may be caught up in these situations where it will be a strain for them to provide maintenance for incapacitated husbands as well. So, the Court will have to consider all circumstances of the case, including the income and earning capacity of the wife or ex-wife, the financial needs of both parties and the needs of the children. This is no different from the considerations for maintenance for wives and ex-wives, where they are also not automatically entitled to maintenance, as highlighted by some of the examples that we have mentioned earlier.",
            "To sum up, while we may review this in future, the proposal to extend maintenance only to incapacitated men is a calibrated measure. It strikes a balance at this stage of our societal development.",
            "As rightly pointed out by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Sun Xueling, there must be a clear priority to better enforce maintenance payments and to improve the process. And indeed, I fully agree with many Members who have cited many examples that you have come across. It is very agonising for an individual to repeatedly go to the Courts because the ex-spouse vindictively does not want to pay up. This is why the way we want to approach this – is to set in place to introduce in the Courts the Maintenance Record Officer which would take place later this year. The purpose of this Officer is to assist the Courts to better assess if a defaulter is incorrigible, and therefore allow the Courts to take firm action against him, if so. Let me assure the House that we are going to do more to stop such irresponsibility.",
            "We will also constantly and continually explore how to improve the processes and to make it less onerous for all those affected. This is something we recognise and we work closely with the Family Justice Courts on this as well.",
            "Let me now address the issue raised by Dr Lily Neo on upstream measures to prevent sham marriages. All couples marrying under Women's Charter must undergo document verification and make a statutory declaration on matters relating to the intended marriage. Where there are doubts, ROM staff will interview the couple separately and explain the consequences of entering into a marriage of convenience. We have found this useful, intervening at this stage. Also, the Registrar will not issue any marriage licence to the couple unless the Registrar is satisfied that the intended marriage meets the conditions under the Women's Charter.",
            "Mr Louis Ng asked if the decision to void a marriage should be subjected to the judicial process. Marriages are void only when at least one party is successfully charged and deemed guilty by the Courts under section 57C of the Immigration Act for entering into a marriage of convenience. Such cases would have been scrutinised through the judicial process. It is only consistent that such marriages are consequentially and automatically void, given that the act of entering into such a marriage is an offence.",
            "Mr Louis Ng suggested that all persons under 21 years be allowed to apply for a Personal Protection Order (PPO) and Domestic Exclusion Orders (DEO) for themselves against anyone in their household, without the need for parental consent. It would be in a minor's interests to have a reliable adult apply on their behalf. The application may be made by the parent who is not the perpetrator of violence. If the parents or guardians are themselves the violence perpetrators, a relative or any social worker appointed by the Minister, can step in, without the need for consent from the minor's parents or guardians.",
            "Mr Louis Ng also asked about the circumstances in which the Director of Social Welfare can detain vulnerable female minors aged 16 to 21 years old in places of safety. All cases which come to the attention of the Director are thoroughly investigated. A girl will only be admitted to a place of safety if the Director is satisfied it will be in her best interests. For example, if it is unsafe for the girl to remain with her immediate family or if she may engage in morally risky behaviours.",
            "Mr Louis Ng also asked if married minors who have suffered domestic violence can seek refuge at places of safety. Yes, they can seek accommodation and support from crisis shelters.",
            "Mr Alex Yam asked about incidents where the security of places of safety was compromised and measures to protect the residents and professionals. For the safety of its residents, crisis shelters are housed in secured premises with closed-circuit television cameras. Thus far, there have been no serious breaches. There were two instances of disturbances at the shelters known to MSF in the last couple of years. In both instances, the Police took swift action as the shelters had established good networks with them. No one was hurt in both incidents but I do take on-board your concerns.",
            "In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, our family provides us meaning, hope, support and an anchor in life. The Women's Charter is a piece of legislation with historical significance that seeks to balance the interests of different groups – the rights and protection of spouses, ex-spouses and their children. Members such as Ms Jessica Tan have also reaffirmed its relevance.",
            "We will work closely with stakeholders as well as this House to shape our legislation to better reflect the changing Singapore society. At the same time, notwithstanding legislation, we will make sure that there are programmes in place to support Singaporeans who do have need for help. At the same time, I encourage families and the community to play an active role to support families in need.",
            "Our efforts obviously must not end with the legislative changes. We all have a collective responsibility to support good marriages and positive parent-child relationships. Strong families are indeed a haven for each and every child. With that, Mdm Speaker, thank you very much."

We believe that there are counselling, programmes and support made available for all couples who are seeking help or who are looking for support. At this moment, we do not envisage making it mandatory but what we do want to make sure is that the support programmes are in place for those who do need the support. For adult couples, we do encourage them to come forward. We are not at that stage where we plan to make it mandatory for non-minor couples.",
            "With regards to Tribunal, that is one possibility but we do believe that the approach that we plan to take in terms of putting in the MRO, working with the Family Justice Courts, would be one way to address this issue. It is very much the responsibility of parents to see through their responsibilities. As we all know, there are those who fail to do it.",
            "I want to highlight again, it is important to remember, that while we do encounter frustrating cases where individuals do not receive their maintenance, there are two scenarios. One, there are fathers who are not able to pay because of the circumstances in which they find themselves in, and I think it is important to remember that, and it is important for us to understand and to check to fully understand the background, and extend the appropriate assistance.",
            "The latter group, which I have less sympathy for, are those who can pay but refuse to pay. Setting up a Tribunal is one approach but we believe that actually the laws are in place. What we intend to do is to use the MRO to work the processes to make sure that it is as expeditious as possible. We will run all the necessary checks, so that we will try to minimise the burden on the women who are affected, and then having the law to come in. That should have a salutary effect on those concerned. We will continue to keep this on watch because we do recognise that it is frustrating and difficult for the women involved and their families.",
            "As for the safety of crisis shelters, we do hear your perspectives. For those who we feel are particularly vulnerable, we would place them in crisis shelters. We do also conduct checks in terms of those families and other safe places we put the children up in. Basically, what we have is a graduated approach to security. For those who do need a much more secured environment, we will make sure that crisis shelters are available for them. While for the others, we have slightly more step-down provision."

This is something that I have discussed with my colleagues in MSF, especially for troubled youths who have fallen afoul of the law, who have encountered problems, and whether we should track them and subsequently when they are looking at settling down, for example, do we also provide them counselling support, and so on.",
            "As you would realise, with the numbers of divorces taking place and children being affected, to maintain a register of the affected children and to track them over the years, it is quite a heavy responsibility. We do not plan to do this at this point in time.",

At this point in time, we are not looking at that but I take the Member's suggestion on-board.",

That is why we want to make sure that help is available for the concerned minor and that other adults can be brought to bear. Our Ministry can also direct individuals to support them. Where family violence is involved, it can be very emotive. Where the family member is the perpetrator, we do want to make sure other parties are able to advise and help them make the application."

We do not have plans at this point in time to put all these children on a register. Like I said, the key thing is to make sure that the support programmes are in place, that assistance can be provided to children who are affected, and for them to come forward or for their families to come forward.",
            "I do take the Member's perspective that whether this is something that we should track. We are looking at the possibility of tracking individuals who are affected in different ways, not just by divorce but vulnerable in different sense, because there is a long social tail of issues that can happen if the support is not provided and, indeed, whether some of these intervention should be brought to bear even if the individuals do not come forward.",

We do recognise that vulnerable individuals, especially when they are young, do have serious concerns and whether we should play a much more active role on that front. That is something that we are looking at."

            ": Madam, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"",
            "Transnational organised crime and terrorism continue to pose a growing threat across the globe. According to international organisations such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and INTERPOL, organised criminal networks are expanding and diversifying their activities. Recent terrorist incidents such as the Paris attacks have also shown how attackers have been able to plan attacks from abroad and cross borders to carry out their activities.",
            "As a global financial and transport hub, Singapore is a potential target for organised crime and terrorist groups and a possible conduit for their activities. In order to tackle this trend more effectively, governments and law enforcement agencies around the world need to cooperate more closely and intensively.",
            "The exchange of information is essential to our international cooperation, crime control and border security efforts. Having access to information such as photographs, fingerprints and criminal records aids our law enforcement agencies in their investigations.",
            "For example, fingerprints lifted from a crime scene in Singapore can be compared against fingerprint records held by a foreign law enforcement agency to identify potential foreign suspects. Information on the criminal background of an individual also helps investigations, allows law enforcement agencies to identify recalcitrant offenders, and facilitates the detection of suspicious persons at border checkpoints.",
            "For our law enforcement agencies to ask for and receive such information from our foreign counterparts for the purpose of investigating transnational crime in Singapore, we must be able to reciprocate and share such information in return. This requirement for reciprocity is a long established and internationally accepted principle.",
            "Madam, we have made steady strides to enhance our ability to cooperate with our international partners.",
            "For example, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA) enables us to provide a range of assistance to other countries on criminal matters. This was amended in 2014 to simplify the conditions which must be satisfied before mutual legal assistance can be rendered, and expand the range of offences in respect of which mutual legal assistance may be given or received under that Act.",
            "Our law enforcement agencies also have longstanding arrangements to render assistance to their foreign counterparts at a Police-to-Police level for investigation purposes. This includes the regular exchange of information such as criminal records and relevant identifying information with other law enforcement agencies. This is a common and well established practice among law enforcement agencies around the world. For instance, as a member of INTERPOL, Singapore exchanges information with INTERPOL member countries in accordance with established INTERPOL rules which serve to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the transmitted data. But, in the absence of express legislation, such sharing is heavily circumscribed. For instance, the information generally cannot be adduced as evidence in Court, or used for any other purposes besides investigation.",
            "MHA therefore proposes to amend the Registration of Criminals Act (RCA) to expressly allow a Singapore -designated authority to share such information with foreign law enforcement agencies, on a reciprocal basis, that is, the foreign agencies must be prepared to share similar information with our agencies on the same terms. The transmission of information will be subject to stringent safeguards.",
            "This will also enable us to implement the Preventing and Combating Serious Crime Agreement with the United States of America (US) by allowing information-sharing between both governments for the prevention and combating of serious crimes, such as transnational organised crime and terrorism. The implementation of this agreement enables us to continue to participate in the US Visa-Waiver Programme, which allows Singaporeans to travel to the US for tourism or business without the need for a visa.",
            "Mdm Speaker, let me now turn to the main provisions of this Bill.",
            "First, the Bill introduces a new section 13I to allow a Singaporean designated authority, namely, the Head of the Criminal Records Office, to share information about the individual that is kept on the criminal register with a foreign law enforcement agency, so long as stringent safeguards relating to the retention, use and destruction of the register information are secured through an undertaking given by the foreign law enforcement agency.",
            "This is similar to the practices of foreign jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.",
            "What can be shared? These would include information such as the fingerprints and photographs of any person who is convicted of a crime by a court in Singapore. Such a person's conviction in the register must also not have been spent or treated as spent under the RCA.",
            "What are the safeguards that will be put in place to prevent the wrongful disclosure and abuse of the information?",
            "First, sharing will only be permitted for certain specified purposes. Under section 13I, register information will only be shared with a foreign law enforcement agency if the information is requested for the purpose of comparing information transmitted and identifying matches for investigation in certain matters or for proceedings in respect of those matters; or for deciding whether to make a request under MACMA or a requisition under the Extradition Act, or for a purpose prescribed under the RCA.",
            "Second, the foreign law enforcement agency will need to give us an appropriate undertaking in relation to the retention, use and destruction of the register information, in order to assure us that the confidentiality of information shared will be adequately protected. The foreign law enforcement agency must also comply with conditions prescribed for transmission of register information, and any other conditions that the Singapore designated authority may impose in relation to the transmission. For instance, if a foreign authority has breached certain conditions in the previous undertaking, Singapore may impose additional procedures to prevent similar occurrences.",
            "Third, we will not share the information requested for, if it is contrary to Singapore's public interest, or may prejudice any criminal investigation or criminal proceedings in a Singapore court, or the safety of any person in Singapore.",
            "Mdm Speaker, besides facilitating information sharing, the Bill will also strengthen operational procedures for the collection of particulars to be recorded in the Register of Criminals.",
            "To aid investigations, the RCA currently provides for the taking of registrable particulars, such as fingerprints, and of body samples of a person accused of a crime but only when he is under arrest. The period for which such a person may be detained in custody without a Magistrate's authority cannot exceed 48 hours.",
            "The Bill amends sections 8 and 13B(1) to allow our law enforcement agencies to take the person's registrable particulars and body samples after the person has been released on bail or personal bond, whether by a court or otherwise.",
            "This is necessary because there are some situations where law enforcement agencies will not have the opportunity to take these fingerprints and samples within 48 hours after arrest. Such a scenario could arise during mass arrests, or if an arrested person is warded in hospital for up to 48 hours or longer. Under section 68 of the Criminal Procedure Code, police officers are not permitted to detain a person in custody who has been arrested, without a warrant, longer than 48 hours.",
            "This also aligns the position in Singapore with that in foreign jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, where the Police may register a person while he is on bail if he has not had his fingerprints or samples taken in the course of investigations, or the fingerprints or samples taken are not suitable or of insufficient quality to allow matching comparison or analysis.",
            "Mdm Speaker, with the increasingly transnational nature of crime and with the growing number of terrorist attacks around the world, the need for enhanced international criminal cooperation is more critical than ever before. The enhanced RCA will allow the Police to better cooperate with the international community to prevent, detect and prosecute transnational crime. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move."

            ": Mdm Speaker, I am generally supportive of the Bill, however I wish to raise some concerns about clause 4 which relates to the furnishing of information on our Register of Criminals to foreign law enforcement agencies.",
            "Madam, we can certainly agree about the importance of sharing of information with foreign law enforcement agencies to prevent and solve crimes just as we would value their sharing of information with us. To this end, clause 4 enables a Singapore -designated authority to share with a foreign law enforcement agency, information about an individual recorded on our Register of Criminals.",
            "I have noted that clause 4 details safeguards that the Singapore -designated authority should adhere to before deciding to release any information to the foreign law enforcement agency. Such safeguards include requiring the foreign agency to give an undertaking in relation to the retention, use and destruction of the register information. The foreign agency must also undertake that information received from Singapore will be kept and maintained using such methods and technologies that will ensure that unauthorised persons cannot access the information, and undertake that the information will not be used for ulterior purposes.",
            "It all sounds very good on paper. My question is: to what extent will we exercise due diligence to verify whether the foreign agency requesting the information is able to fulfil the conditions we have set, before we furnish the information requested?",
            "According to the proposed section 13I(4)(6) of the Bill, the Government intends to be able to share information with potentially all countries in the world, since it defines \"foreign law enforcement agency\" very broadly. \"Foreign law enforcement agency\" is defined to include agencies in countries that are members of INTERPOL, as well as those that are not. INTERPOL itself consists of 190 member countries, practically all the nations on earth.",
            "Madam, there is a vast disparity worldwide in the effectiveness of governments, the strength of a country's institutions and state agencies, and levels of corruption. How will the Government go about ascertaining whether a requesting country can fulfil the obligations we expect of them under the Bill?",
            "Earlier in the Second Reading speech, the Senior Minister of State referred to INTERPOL rules, but my question is: how do we know whether these countries can actually fulfil these rules that they have signed up to? And will we take their word for it, or will more be done to ascertain for ourselves? Indeed, Madam, according to the proposed section 13I(3), the Government actually foresees that a receiving country may breach an undertaking given, and this is rather worrying.",
            "Madam, on a related note, the international co-operation envisaged by this Bill will touch on our regional responsibility as a member state of ASEAN. In line with greater ASEAN integration, there have been discussions amongst ASEAN country Ministers about the need for co-operation to combat transnational crime. Transnational crime in ASEAN is understood to refer to drug trafficking, terrorism, economic crimes, human trafficking, money laundering, piracy, weapon smuggling and cybercrime, and since 2015 includes illicit trafficking of wildlife and timber, and people smuggling. Last year, Singapore signed up to the Kuala Lumpur Declaration on Combating Transnational Crime, which calls for a new ASEAN Plan of Action to Combat Transnational Crime and greater information sharing.",
            "With this backdrop, I would have presumed that if a request for register information came from an ASEAN country, it would be contrary to ASEAN integration to reject the request. Given the different stages of development among ASEAN countries and each country's institutions, what has been done or is being done to ensure that ASEAN countries can indeed share crime information with each other, with the confidence that the information will be safeguarded and not abused? Thank you, Madam."

          "speaker": "Mr Christopher de Souza",
          "content": [
            ": Madam, now more than ever, there is a need for closer collaboration between law enforcement agencies, both regionally and globally, to deal with transnational crimes effectively. It is with these considerations in mind that I rise in support this Bill.",
            "Under the Registration of Criminals Act (RCA), the Police are able to keep records in the Register, persons convicted of any crime specified in the First and Second Schedules of the Act. Particulars, such as the photograph, finger impressions, and conviction records are recorded. The Register of Criminals is useful in Police investigations, especially in the identification of suspects. By having access to fingerprints or DNA of persons that have been convicted of scheduled crimes, the Police may be able to expedite their investigations if they are able to find a match between evidence found as part of their investigations and those on the Register.",
            "When the RCA was last amended in 2005, it was amended to help former offenders to reintegrate back into society by allowing those who have criminal records that have been \"spent\" to be deemed to have no record of that conviction if they are able to satisfy a five- year crime-free period. This was a timely and welcomed amendment. Likewise, the proposed amendments to the RCA that are before the House this afternoon are timely and equally important. With the increasing links between countries, we are witnessing unprecedented levels of connectivity in our globalised world. As a result of this increased connectivity, we are also experiencing an increase in transnational crimes across borders.",
            "Allow me to voice some advantages of this Bill. First, the proposed amendments will facilitate the sharing of information between our Home Team and foreign law enforcement agencies. This will enable us to deal with the scourge of transnational crime and terrorist groups more effectively and expeditiously. Through the proposed amendments in the Registration of Criminal (Amendment) Bill, information that is recorded in the Register of Criminals, such as fingerprints or photographs, can be shared with foreign law enforcement agencies for the prevention, investigation and prosecution of crimes regionally, or possibly, globally.",
            "And to prevent any abuse or the wrongful disclosure of the information shared, foreign law enforcement agencies will be required to undertake to protect the confidentiality of the information shared, and to only use the information for crime prevention, criminal investigation or related proceedings. The Singapore designated authority would even have the ability to suspend the transmission of information about an individual if that authority is of the opinion that the foreign law enforcement agency has failed to comply with the undertaking that it had given and does not take steps to rectify the non-compliance. So there are safeguards, Madam.",
            "Furthermore, our Home Team will also be able to request for reciprocal assistance from law enforcement agencies when investigating and prosecuting criminals in Singapore, through a crime prevention exchange of information arrangement with other foreign law enforcement agencies. This will strengthen Singapore's ability to pursue criminals who operate beyond national boundaries. This is especially important in light of the establishment of the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore in 2014. With the increasingly fast-paced criminal landscape, local and foreign enforcement agencies must ensure that there is a collaborative framework in place to facilitate the timely exchange of vital information and intelligence, so that we are able to deal with transnational crimes quickly and effectively.",
            "Second, or second advantage, the proposed amendments will also strengthen operational procedures for the registration of criminals in Singapore. At present, the CRO only allows authorised officers to take finger impressions, photographs and body samples of persons who are arrested and are accused of a crime. However, authorised officers are not able to obtain these \"registrable particulars\" or body samples from individuals who have been released on bail or a personal bond but are still under investigation. This may hinder the conduct of a thorough investigation by the Police where a crime has been committed and the Police are conducting their investigations. It bears noting that there are already safeguards which may help ensure that these proposed augmented powers of the Police to obtain \"registrable particulars\" or body samples are not abused.",
            "For instance, the RCA already provides that in the event that finger impressions, photographs, registrable particulars, and body samples are taken from a person during an investigation, but the person is acquitted or discharged without a conviction being recorded against him, the authorised officer in-charge of the case shall immediately inform the Registrar of the acquittal or discharge. The Registrar will then be required to destroy the finger impressions, photographs and registrable particulars that were obtained pursuant to the RCA, and to immediately remove the DNA information of that person from the DNA database. However, I have a series of questions here:",
            "What if investigations cease before acquittal or before the case gets to Court? Or what if there is a long delay in investigations? Or if investigations are put on hold for an unduly long period of time? Should not the registrable particulars and the like be destroyed in these situations also?",
            "In conclusion, the Bill reflects the new realities of transnational crimes and terrorist groups, and the need for the timely exchange of information between Singapore and foreign law enforcement agencies. Ultimately, a collaborative approach to investigation and information sharing is essential if we want to be able to deal with transnational crimes quickly, decisively and effectively. However, Madam, it is equally important to emphasise that it is also incumbent on the Police and authorities to ensure such private information is not abused or illegitimately utilised. Madam, I support this Bill."

            ": Madam, I rise in support of the Bill. In today's porous, globally-connected world where terrorism has cast a growing shadow on lives worldwide, sharing criminal records across borders fulfils a basic security need.",
            "Take the Paris terror attacks, which killed 130 people, as an example. The day after the gun and suicide-bomb attacks, one of the suspects who survived was stopped by the French police but was later released. Belgian police had, unfortunately, failed to share with their French counterparts about the information that this man was a known radical who had tried to travel to Syria to fight for Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS. The man is still on the run today.",
            "Closer to home, in Indonesia, several militant groups have pledged allegiance to ISIS. In January, at least eight people were killed in an ISIS-perpetrated attack near a Jakarta shopping mall.",
            "The Malaysian authorities have foiled several ISIS-inspired attack plots and arrested several persons involved in ISIS activities. Just last week, the Australian Government indicated that terrorists may be planning attacks in Malaysia and Indonesia. In Singapore, the Internal Security Department recently arrested 27 male Bangladeshi nationals working in Singapore, who were planning to take part in extremist activities in other countries, including Bangladesh, their home country.",
            "So, given this scenario, the sharing of criminal records, fingerprints and photographs across borders will make it harder for terrorists and criminals to travel under false identities. Cross-border cooperation does not just address concerns over terrorism, but also online commercial crime, money laundering and other transnational crimes.",
            "In Europe, the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) was set up in 2012 to allow courts and law enforcement agencies to obtain criminal records from other EU member states. Since the introduction of ECRIS, 288,000 such requests are made every year across the EU. In the wake of the Paris terror attacks, it was announced in January 2016 that ECRIS will be further expanded to include the fingerprints of non-EU citizens.",
            "Closer to home, also in response to the Paris terror attacks, Malaysia and the American governments signed an agreement in November 2015 to share a database containing the biometric records of about 1.2 million people suspected of terrorism and other serious crimes. The list of suspects will be used by security officials at all entry points in Malaysia as well as across the United States.",
            "Transnational co-operation is a step in the right direction toward the prevention of global crime. I understand that Singapore enjoys a close working relationship with INTERPOL, as said by the Senior Minister of State, and MHA has set up units to facilitate international exchange. For instance, the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO) within the Commercial Affairs Department shares financial intelligence with foreign counterparts if they had signed MOUs, while the Singapore Police Force's International Cooperation Department facilitates co-operation and information exchange with foreign counterparts.",
            "Thus, I would like to clarify with the Senior Minister of State, how would the proposed amendment bill tie in with Singapore's international working arrangements with INTERPOL, and various other platforms which already exist for information exchange on global crimes? How many countries have similar provisions that can share their criminal records with Singapore besides US, UK, Australia and New Zealand, mentioned by the Senior Minister of State earlier on? Does it mean that no other ASEAN countries have a similar profession to share the information with Singapore?",
            "In addition, I would like to request the Senior Minister of State to elaborate more on the safeguards to prevent abuse and to protect the interests of Singaporeans under the amendment Bill. The last thing we want is for a Singaporean with decades-old criminal records of petty crimes, to have his history made known to the immigration officer at an immigration checkpoint of a foreign country, thereby subjecting him to unnecessary body and bag checks.",
            "Therefore, we would like to know when, what and how the criminal records would be shared with other countries. Firstly, when would Singapore share the criminal records with foreign countries? Will the exchange of criminal records be shared on a request-only basis? Secondly what kind of criminal records will be shared with other countries?",
            "Singapore, as mentioned, has focused very much on the rehabilitation and re-integration of offenders into the society. The Yellow Ribbon Project has made much progress in recent years. Therefore I am very glad that the Senior Minister of State has confirmed that criminal records that had been rendered as spent will be not be shared with other countries. But does it mean that all other records, beside those as spent, in the Register of Criminals will be share with other Countries?",
            "And thirdly, how will the criminal records be shared with other countries? Will it be via a shared platform like the ECRIS? If this is so, we could have a problem of different countries tracking different things, to different degrees and for different lengths of time.",
            "For example, when the EU adopted ECRIS, it became apparent that Britain hangs on to the most minor convictions for years. As a result, local job-seekers could not apply for \"sensitive\" jobs like teachers and policemen while migrants from other EU countries go to England and apply for these jobs because their countries wipe the slate clean, or did not keep records of low-level offences. Clearly, the \"seriousness\" and treatment of crimes are regarded differently across borders and this constitutes a problem.",
            "How will foreign law enforcement agencies undertake to protect the confidentiality of information? How do we ensure that the information shared will not be abused for other purposes? What other safeguards are there?",
            "Will Singaporeans be unfairly treated when they work and live in other countries that have access to our criminal records? The implications could be even more acute if Singaporeans are residing in countries with high 99% conviction, or higher, in the Court.",
            "In conclusion, Madam, I support the Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill to share the criminal records with a foreign law enforcement agency. However, Singaporeans deserve to know in detail what, when and how information is shared with a foreign country to prevent abuse so as not to disadvantage Singaporeans unnecessarily. Thank you."

            ": Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Christopher de Souza, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Ang Wei Neng for speaking on the Bill. All three have raised a couple of questions which I will seek to address.",
            "First, Madam, Mr Ang asked how the RCA amendments would complement existing working arrangements that we currently have with other countries. Let me first set the context for how international co-operation in criminal matters is carried out.",
            "Singapore relies on a combination of formal and informal co-operation channels to exchange information with foreign counterparts.",
            "I had mentioned earlier the Act known as MACMA, or the Mutual Assistance of Criminal Matters Act. This provides a formal channel through which law enforcement agencies render legal assistance to foreign law enforcement agencies with respect to any criminal matter. So for instance, under MACMA you can ask for the collection of evidence, you can ask for search and seizure, freezing of accounts, arrangements for witnesses to be made available to give evidence and so on and so forth.",
            "But beyond the MACMA framework for formal assistance, our law enforcement agencies can also render assistance informally either through INTERPOL, which most countries are members of as Ms Sylvia Lim pointed out, or directly with our foreign counterparts through Police-to-Police contacts.",
            "Currently, any request for register information has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis for public interest. The Bill clarifies that register information can be shared for specified purposes only and this will enable us to act more quickly and more effectively. For instance, register information can be shared to help identify suspects in time-critical investigations. The Bill also expressly allows register information to be shared as a precursor to a request for more formal assistance under MACMA. In other words, the Bill which amends the RCA, will complement the MACMA process and strengthen our fight against transnational crime.",
            "Members also asked about the mechanics of sharing register information with foreign counterparts, so in a sense it addresses partly what Mr Ang has asked, and what Ms Sylvia Lim has asked.",
            "Under the proposed amendments, a foreign law enforcement agency may request for register information for certain purposes specified in the Act, which I have just mentioned earlier. One of which is to compare the register information with information held by the foreign law enforcement agency to identify suspects involved in the investigation of a matter.",
            "Exchange of information can also be made to prevent crime. Depending on the arrangement between Singapore and the foreign law enforcement agency, the Singapore- designated authority, or the head of CRO, may be able to share register information pursuant to the arrangement even in the absence of a specific request for the transmission of that information.",
            "A Singapore- designated authority may share such information to assist a foreign law enforcement agency in investigating or prosecuting foreign offences, particularly serious criminal or terrorist offences. Even then, register information will be shared on a limited basis and foreign agencies will certainly not get unfettered access to all our data.",
            "With regard to the transmission of register information in relation to the investigation of a foreign offence or an investigation to prevent the commission of a foreign offence, I should highlight that the Bill provides a definition of what a foreign offence is. A foreign offence is defined to mean an offence against the law of the foreign country, which if the conduct constituting the foreign offence had occurred in Singapore, would amount to an offence against the law of Singapore punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 12 months. And in this way, this ensures that information is not disclosed for non-serious or trivial matters.",
            "I would also like to assure Mr Ang that the register information to be shared will not include spent criminal records.",
            "Now I come to the nub of Ms Sylvia Lim's and Mr Ang's concerns, which are principally about safeguards to be imposed and the concern about whether our counterparts will adhere to the conditions that they have agreed to and the undertakings they have given and vice versa.",
            "Before I go into the details, I think it is important to recognise the balance that we seek the strike here. On the one hand, we are certainly very concerned about the confidentiality of information, the identifiable information, names, photographs, fingerprints. But, equally of concern is the need for law enforcement agencies around the world to get up to pace in terms of international cooperation. Crime knows no boundaries with the Internet, with travel being so easy, and with borders being relatively porous. Transnational organised crime sometimes leads governments and foreign law enforcement agencies to scuttle around to try to nip out the problem; so co-operation is essential, otherwise we fall behind the curve.",
            "Mr Ang and Ms Sylvia Lim raised challenges and concerns regarding the sharing of information or data on certain shared platforms. Mr Ang mentioned the ECRIS, or the European Criminal Records Information System, and we are mindful of this and are careful to ensure that procedures and infrastructure of all parties concerned protect the confidentiality of the information transmitted. We will certainly not deposit register information on such a shared platform.",
            "We understand the privacy concerns associated with the sharing of information or data with foreign jurisdictions. We would like to assure Members of the House that the Bill will reduce the potential for misuse of information, and Singapore will not take any breach of confidentiality lightly. I earlier highlighted the key safeguards. Now, let me elaborate on the relevant provisions.",
            "First, in order to allow the sharing of register information between Singapore and a foreign law enforcement agency, that agency must give us an appropriate undertaking to use the information disclosed only for a specified purpose listed under the Act. Requests that are made in a broad or tenuous manner, or by way of a \"fishing expedition\", will not be acceded to or entertained.",
            "To be clear, we will not accede to any request for information to be disclosed for any purpose that is unrelated to the prevention and combating of crime and terrorism, such as, for instance, employment screening purposes. Foreign law enforcement agencies should also never use our records for such irrelevant purposes. Should they do so or breach any of the terms of the undertaking, there will be consequences, as I will explain shortly.",
            "Members asked whether a past criminal record of petty crime would expose a Singaporean to undue security checks at overseas border checkpoints – I believe Mr Ang did ask that at the end of his speech. The answer is no. A criminal record does not automatically result in enhanced checks at checkpoints. Every country, including us in Singapore, has its own entry requirements to prevent, deter and detect undesirable individuals entering their country. Singaporeans seeking to enter a foreign country must meet the country's entry requirements, which may include holding a valid passport or entry visa. Ultimately, a foreign country retains the right to impose conditions or refuse entry to migrants at the checkpoint.",
            "Second, the foreign law enforcement agency is also required to undertake to protect the confidentiality of information by ensuring that the information is kept and maintained using methods and technologies that ensure that unauthorised persons cannot access the information. A Singapore- designated authority will be able to refuse further transmission of register information to a foreign agency if the Singapore- designated authority is of the opinion that the foreign law enforcement agency has breached such an undertaking and has not taken steps to rectify the non-compliance.",
            "Third, the foreign law enforcement agency must be able to comply with conditions prescribed for the transmission of register information under the Act, and any other conditions that the Singapore authority may impose specially in relation to the transmission. This includes complying with any request by Singapore to delete or update the records if a criminal conviction has been rendered spent.",
            "These safeguards will ensure that any exchange of information is limited to countries that ensure the confidentiality of information exchanged and prevent its unauthorised use.",
            "In the course of her speech, Ms Sylvia Lim noted all these safeguards, but her concern was how we will ensure on a practical basis that these safeguards are met. She also mentioned that the membership of INTERPOL covers much of the globe, we are all party to this international co-operation arrangement for law enforcement.",
            "Now, while the Act does appear to allow us to share information with all these countries and more, the reality is that by striking that balance between the need for co-operation and privacy, Singapore will conduct its due diligence in working out arrangements, ensuring undertakings are made, given and also able to be abided by and audited. This is not something that can be done overnight. It involves agencies knowing each other, meeting each other, having lots of discussions about the safeguards that need to be put in place, the software, the systems, the audit mechanisms that need to be ensured, in order to ensure that level of trust to allow us to share information expeditiously. Because sometimes, time is of the essence, criminals will not wait for you, sharing information quickly will help us to deter, prevent and ultimately to solve crime.",
            "I believe Mr Christopher de Souza did ask a question about the taking of photographs and fingerprints of a persons accused of crime. Under the current Act it would be when a person is under arrest. Under this Bill, we seek to expand it to when a person is on bail or when the person is given a personal bond, and I believe Members who have spoken understand the necessity of having this mechanism. But Mr de Souza's concern is what if a person's case has been put into abeyance for some time, or if the trial is particularly long or has been set for a date far into the future, is it fair that the data is kept on the register?",
            "If we look at section 4 of the Act, section 4 would not be touched. Section 4 states that the Register of Criminals is kept for persons who are convicted of crimes. While the fingerprints and photographs may have been taken at the point of arrest, they will not be recorded on the register. It will only be recorded when the case has been completed or if a person has been convicted.",
            "If there is a subsequent acquittal, or if the conviction is rendered spent, the record will be deleted. So, I hope that this assures the Member that it will not unduly compromise the persons in Singapore whose trials may take a little longer.",
            "Mdm Speaker in conclusion, the threats of transnational crime and terrorism will continue to grow. To be effective against such threats we must have greater cooperation in the information exchange between law enforcement agencies. This Bill will improve Singapore's ability to cooperate with our international partners while ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place."

            "This Bill will amend the CPF Act in four broad areas.",
            "First, to implement previously announced policy changes related to Part One of the CPF Advisory Panel's recommendations.",
            "Second, enhance the insurance coverage under the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) and Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS).",
            "Third, safeguard the Medisave monies claimed by medical institutions and approved insurers.",
            "Fourth, make various amendments to clarify and streamline the administration of the CPF system.",
            "Let me explain.",
            "Madam, the first set of amendments pertains to Part One of the CPF Advisory Panel's recommendations. The Government has implemented the Panel's recommendations since January 2016 based on provisions within the current CPF Act. We are now amending the CPF Act to enable the CPF Board to implement these changes more directly.",
            "Let me recap some new flexibilities that CPF members can now enjoy.",
            "We are amending the CPF Act to make it directly explicit that CPF members aged 55 and above can transfer savings from their CPF accounts, including their Retirement Account, to their spouses if they have set aside the Basic Retirement Sum, or BRS in short.",
            "Previously, members, including those less than 55, would have to set aside the Full Retirement Sum (FRS), which is twice the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), before they could make transfers to their spouses' accounts.",
            "We agreed with the CPF Advisory Panel to reduce the requirement from the Full Retirement Sum to the Basic Retirement Sum so that more CPF members can make top-ups to their spouses' CPF savings. This flexibility will be useful for spouses who may not have enough CPF savings to join CPF LIFE for reasons such as leaving the workforce earlier to take care of their children.",
            "Both husband and wife can then have their own CPF LIFE plans and more secured retirement income for life. When one spouse passes away, the surviving spouse will still be assured of lifelong payouts. As a family unit, both husband and wife can also maximise the Extra Interest earned on their combined CPF savings.",
            "I encourage members to make full use of this flexibility to enhance their spouses' retirement adequacy.",
            "We are also amending the CPF Act to state clearly that members will not be assessed for inclusion into the CPF LIFE scheme at age 55. This is because members now need to choose their CPF LIFE plan only when they reach their Payout Eligibility Age. Hence, the previous requirement to select their CPF LIFE plan at age 55, which could be about ten years before the start of payouts, is no longer necessary. Going forward, members will therefore need to be assessed for auto-inclusion into CPF LIFE only at their Payout Eligibility Age.",
            "The second set of amendments relates to enhancing the insurance coverage under the CPF insurance schemes. These are the Home Protection Scheme and the Dependants' Protection Scheme, or HPS and DPS for short.",
            "Today, members can only make a claim from HPS and DPS in the event of death or incapacity. By incapacity, it means that a member must not be able to ever continue in any form of employment. Currently, members with terminal illnesses or total permanent disability but can still do some form of work, do not fall within this definition of incapacity and hence do not qualify to make claims under HPS and DPS.",
            "We are amending the CPF Act to expand the definition of incapacity to include members with terminal illness and total permanent disability who may still be working or able to do some form of work, but in a diminished capacity. This change will benefit new and existing persons insured under HPS and DPS, subject to the exclusions in their individual insurance covers arising from pre-existing conditions.",
            "I hope that this broader protection from our CPF insurance schemes will provide CPF members with greater peace of mind.",
            "Today, insured members who have run out of OA savings can only use their spouses' OA savings to pay for their HPS premiums if the spouse is a co-owner. We are now amending the CPF Act to allow such insured members to also use the OA savings of other co-owners including children, parents, or siblings to help pay for their HPS premiums.",
            "By allowing greater household support for the payment of HPS premiums, we can reduce the risk of lapsed insurance covers due to non-payment of HPS premiums. More CPF members and their families will therefore be protected from losing their homes in the unfortunate event of death, permanent incapacity, terminal illness or total permanent disability.",
            "Madam, the third set of amendments pertains to strengthening safeguards for Medisave monies claimed by Medical Institutions and Approved Insurers.",
            "Today, Medical Institutions and Approved Insurers help to facilitate the withdrawals from CPF member's Medisave Accounts for approved treatments and uses under the Medisave Scheme. In 2015, about $2.7 billion of Medisave savings was withdrawn.",
            "Most Medical Institutions and Approved Insurers have made proper claims of Medisave monies and complied with our audit requirements. However, a small number of Medical Institutions and Approved Insurers still make errors in some of their claims. For example, in the past three years, we saw an average of about 40 cases a year of claims from wrong members' accounts.",
            "To strengthen the safeguards over Medisave claims, this amendment will allow CPF Board to impose administrative penalties on Medical Institutions and Approved Insurers that make wrong or unauthorised claims on members' Medisave monies; or do not comply with audits ordered by CPF Board or other administrative requirements.",
            "These amendments will make Medical Institutions and Approved Insurers more accountable when they make claims of Medisave monies. The amended CPF Act will also mandate the recovery of any Medisave monies arising from unauthorised or wrongful deductions, or uncompleted prepaid treatment packages.",
            "Madam, the fourth and last set of amendments pertains to other amendments that provide greater clarity in the administration of the CPF system. I will provide two examples.",
            "The first example is to revise the method of estimating the additional wages that attract CPF contributions. Today, employers are required to make an estimation based on previous year's income. We are amending the CPF Act to allow employers to also make an estimation based on the projected wages in the current year.",
            "This amendment will improve efficiency as employers can estimate CPF liabilities more accurately, reducing the chances of employers over-paying CPF contributions. This will minimise the need for employers to apply for refunds for over-payments.",
            "The second example is to allow CPF members to apply to withdraw cash payouts that were credited to their accounts under various Government schemes such as the GST-Voucher. This happens when the cheques were not cashed and subsequently expired. As these payouts are meant to support members' daily needs, this amendment will allow members to withdraw these credited monies, without being subject to existing CPF withdrawal rules.",
            "Madam, in conclusion, taken in total, the amendments in this Bill will enable the CPF Board to implement policies aimed at providing greater flexibility while enhancing CPF members' retirement adequacy, and also to enhance insurance coverage and improve the accountability of Medisave usage for CPF members. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move."

            ":The importance of mortgage insurance coverage struck close to home when I lost an uncle more than a decade ago. He passed away in a motorcycle accident and did not have any HPS coverage. A sizeable mortgage sum remained outstanding and it was left to my aunt and cousins to commit significant resources to continue making mortgage payments on top of their own commitments.",
            "At that time, I thought HPS non-coverage was a rare occurrence. But years later, it was heart-breaking to find out that some of my own residents, albeit a small number, found themselves in exactly the same position as my aunt and cousins when their sole breadwinner passes away unexpectedly.",
            "To that end, I wish to acknowledge the compassion shown by CPF and HDB staff to try their best to assist affected families by retrospectively reinstating HPS coverage in certain cases so that the other family members do not face hardship. In my last term, one particular family benefited from CPF's helpfulness and were profuse in their appreciation to me for pursuing the matter, but the appreciation should rightfully go to the agencies concerned."
          ]

          "speaker": "[Mr Deputy Speaker",
          "content": [
            "According to the CPF, as of 2013, about 70% of all HDB flat owners were covered by the HPS. In 2012, a total of 1,074 claims amounting to $89.8 million were made to HPS policyholders. At the 2014 Committee of Supply debate, I spoke on the HPS, requesting the CPF to require HDB flat owners who are paying for their mortgage in cash to sign up for the HPS as a matter of course. More generally, the cut requested the Government to step up education on the importance of HPS, especially for low- to middle-income households.",
            "Separately, the statistics pointed to an increase in the number of members who had lapsed in their HPS premium payments or who were no longer insurable for medical and other reasons. It was 1.7% and 2% respectively in April 2011 and, by October 2013, the percentages had increased to 2% and 3%.",
            "To this end, I welcome the current amendments to allow co-owners, who could be family members, to help pay for HPS premiums, not just spouses. This should mitigate or reduce the number of lapsed policyholders going forward. However, for greater clarity, can the Minister give the House a primer on the regulations the CPF has in mind in reinstating HPS insurance cover for paid claims when it is not liable to do so?",
            "Improvements to the scheme. While I welcome all the HPS-related amendments, I have three suggestions to make that could help strengthen the HPS.",
            "First, covering Singaporeans with pre-existing illnesses. In 2011, the CPF amendment modified the HPS scheme to allow for more portability, so that in the event the homeowner who purchased a new HDB flat was no longer in good health, he would remain insured under the scheme by way of earlier participation. This amendment acknowledges that a member in ill-health could yet be covered so as not to prejudice him or her. With the introduction of MediShield Life by the Government, a seminal change that differentiated it from the old MediShield scheme, was the inclusion of members with pre-existing conditions, albeit with a 30% increase in premiums payable. The philosophical basis of this move was in concert with making Singapore an inclusive society. Similarly, HPS coverage for Singaporeans with pre-existing illnesses will buttress this in.",
            "The Government has raised its concerns about such an expansion, specifically on premium affordability in the past, and this is not an irrelevant consideration. However, similar misgivings were overcome in the move from MediShield to MediShield Life. In August 2015, CPF paid out more than at least $400 in HPS rebates to each of the 470,000 Singaporeans and PRs on HPS. This came up to almost $1.9 billion and with yet many thousands of other homeowners receiving less than the $400 but receiving a rebate, nonetheless. The last time such rebates were paid out was in 2006. In between, in 2011, HPS premiums were lowered by an average of 12% for some 80% of HPS members. The remaining 20% were already paying low premiums.",
            "With these numbers in mind, it would appear that there is some scope to relook at the prospect of covering members in poor health under the HPS. I hope the Board can commit itself to look seriously to cover Singaporeans with pre-existing illnesses.",
            "Secondly, plugging gaps for lapsed policyholders. While the HPS is compulsory for all members who use their CPF to pay for their HDB flats, subject to HDB's approval, members can choose to opt out should they take up a similar mortgage reducing insurance. In 2015, it was made known that 43,610 flat owners had been given permission to do so by the HDB. However, my understanding is that HDB does not monitor these members thereafter, allowing them to theoretically opt out of their mortgage reducing insurance shortly thereafter. In such a case, these households effectively fall through the cracks. Can the Minister confirm if CPF will consider plugging this hole in future and require them to sign up to the HPS in the event their mortgage reducing insurance lapses?",
            "Thirdly, reminders. I understand the CPF sends two reminder letters to the policyholder in the event of HPS premium non-payment. In an effort to highlight the importance of this scheme, can I confirm if these notifications are by ordinary post or registered mail? In addition, early reminders to the policyholders of low CPF balances for HPS premiums may be a powerful signalling tool that can prod members to top up their Ordinary Accounts (OA) or, at the very least, seek assistance early, if they have other financial problems.",
            "In conclusion, when I spoke on raising the awareness of the HPS in the 2014 Committee of Supply debate, the Minister of State replied that the HDB issues a booklet, on the purchase of a property, to educate home buyers of the scheme. With a rising senior citizen population and constant reminders in the press about how Singaporeans do not plan well for retirement, the Ministry should step up its efforts to constantly inform homeowners of the benefits of the scheme every few years through brochures and pamphlets as they service their mortgages, and seriously look at including Singaporeans with pre-existing illnesses to improve the scheme further. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill."

            "Mr Deputy Speaker, may I speak in Mandarin.",
            "I support the proposed amendments to the bill in respect of the Home Protection Scheme (HPS). The HPS is a mortgage-reducing insurance that protects members and their families against losing their homes in the event of death or permanent incapacity before their housing loans are paid up. It is compulsory for any HDB home owner who is using his or her CPF savings to pay the monthly housing loan instalments for his or her HDB flat. The Scheme does not cover private residential properties, executive condominiums (ECs) or privatised Housing and Urban Development Company (HUDC) flats. Buyers can only opt out of the Scheme if they have taken a similar mortgage-reducing insurance policy.",
            "The Bill seeks to enhance insurance coverage under the HPS. Under the proposed amendments, a CPF member who is insured under the Scheme will now be allowed to make a claim under the Scheme for terminal illness and total permanent disability, even though the member is not incapacitated from ever continuing in any employment. If this is a substantial change, it will represent a departure from the existing ruling under the current Act and it will be a welcomed change as it may provide more flexibility for members who are caught in different situations. I note that the same change is also effected in the same bill for the Dependents' Protection Insurance Scheme.",
            "However, it seems to me from a plain reading of the amendment bill that the only situations where a member can make a claim under the Scheme for terminal illness and total permanent disability, even though the member is not incapacitated from ever continuing in any employment are if (1) the member is suffering from terminal illness and is said by a registered medical practitioner to be expected to result in death within 12 months or (2) the member has suffered total or permanent disability of less than two eyes, two limbs or one eye and one limb. The scenarios seem rather limited. May the minister please clarify whether this is what the Bill intended? Does the Bill provide for any other situation and where is this provided in the Bill?",
            "If the Bill does not provide clearly for any other scenario, I am concerned that the Act may not be clear enough about the circumstances that may apply to the new situation where a CPF member who is insured under the Scheme will now be allowed to make a claim under the Scheme for terminal illness and total permanent disability, even though the member is not incapacitated from ever continuing in any employment. I seek the Minister's assurance that the CPF Board will provide clear communication to CPF members for the circumstances which may apply under this proposed amendment.",
            "The Bill also seeks to allow a non-spouse member who is a co-owner of a property to pay the premium for the HPS Scheme of the other co-owner. I welcome this change as this recognises the possibility as well as perhaps the increasing occurrence of the situation where co-owners may not be spouses. For example in the case of a flat which is owned by a man and his mother. The change will address the current anomaly in the present Act.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, I refer to the amendment in clause 28(h) of the Bill whereby the Board has the right not to pay under the Scheme where a member was suffering from an illness when he joins the Scheme. May the minister clarify what would be these circumstances where the board may permit a member to join the Scheme even though the Board may be aware of the member suffering from an illness at the time of joining the Scheme?",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand that under the current Act, people with certain pre-existing illnesses are not covered by the Act. Can the minister please confirm whether such members will still not be covered by the Scheme after the amendment? Will the minister consider allowing special form of coverage under the Scheme perhaps on a case by case basis and even on a different premium?",
            "The Bill also provides for regulations to be made to prescribe the circumstances where the CPF Board may issue or reinstate an insurance cover or pay claims where the Board is not liable to do so under sections 36(9) or (10). May the minister please clarify the intention behind this proposed inclusion?",
            "I also support the amendments which allows the transfer of moneys from the member's retirement account to another member's account for the purchase of a HDB flat.",
            "The amendments also allow CPF members to top up their spouse's Retirement or Special Account using money from their Retirement Account. This flexibility will benefit both the Member and his/her spouse. I support the amendments. Thank you."

          "content": [
            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for letting me speak on the Bill. CPF monies are, for many Singaporeans, a key source of funds and savings, and many seek greater flexibility on the withdrawal and use of the funds. While recognising the need to allow for greater flexibility, with Singaporeans living longer, CPF funds remain an important source of a basic level of retirement funds.",
            "The amendments proposed provide for changes related to Part 1 of the CPF Advisory Panel's recommendations on enabling flexibility while ensuring retirement adequacy. But at the same time, I would say this is an extremely challenging balance to achieve.",
            "The Retirement Sum and the CPF LIFE plan are to meet the objective of giving members a monthly payout for life. Currently, subject to the amount of the CPF balances and the amount that they desire for monthly payouts, CPF Members have to make a choice of CPF LIFE plan − whether it is the LIFE Standard or the LIFE Basic Plan − when they turn 55 years of age. The difference in the CPF LIFE plans is the monthly payouts you would receive and the amount you would bequest to the beneficiaries after you have passed on.",
            "So, I do welcome this change of not requiring members to make that decision on the choice of the CPF LIFE plan at the age of 55 as this is effectively ten years before their Payout Eligibility Age (PAE) which is currently 65 years. With the amendments, members will now only need to choose their CPF LIFE plan closer to the start of their CPF LIFE payouts, which can be anytime between their Payout Eligibility Age (PEA) or if they choose, up to age 70. Taking a decision closer to the date of the start of payouts will allow members to decide on the plan that best meets their retirement needs at the time.",
            "This change, while giving greater flexibility and enabling better decisions to meet retirement needs of members, however, does not address some of the concerns that members have with regard to the PEA. As PEA currently depends on your year of birth, this is not only confusing as to what your PEA is, there is also concern that this will continue to adjust for the subsequent age group of members. This does cause uncertainty for members as PEA determines when you can start receiving your CPF LIFE payouts. This gives a sense that access to CPF payouts are getting further delayed and can only be accessed when you get much older. While I understand the need to make the adjustments to be in line with people living longer and the standard of living, it is also important to give members some certainty.",
            "Setting the expectations on previous PEA, some members also — when they set the expectations, they kind of expect the payouts at that age – they feel misled that they had been expecting payouts at a certain age, and when that moves, it gets a little bit disappointing and other times, a sense of mistrust develops. So, it would be good to understand the criteria for changing the PEA and what members can expect in the future for the PEA.",
            "The proposed change also provides flexibility to allow for CPF members aged 55 years and older; once they have set aside the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), to then transfer monies from their CPF accounts to their spouses – a Retirement Account (RA) or Special Accounts (SA). So, this is until January this year, was twice the Basic Retirement Sum, so therefore, this change is definitely welcomed because it will help them help their spouses grow their retirement savings, as well as to benefit from the Extra Interest on lower CPF balances. This, as Minister has pointed out, clearly will give the spouses better assurances of LIFE payouts for either of the spouses.",
            "So, for older Singaporean women, I think this flexibility is important because to receive top up from their spouses – as many have not accumulated much CPF savings as men in that age group. In 2013, the median CPF savings for women aged 51 to 54 was about $90,000, as compared to the males in that age group which is about $130,000.",
            "The changes proposed in the Bill of including Terminal Illness and Total Permanent Disability as grounds for claims under Home Protection Scheme (HPS) and Dependent Protection Scheme (DPS) will allow members with terminal illness and total permanent disability to make claims on their HPS and DPS even when they are able to do some work; as Minister has shared, although in a diminished capacity.",
            "I applaud this change as it not only enhances, but it really does give assurance to members as well as their families that they will have access and support when their family most need it.",
            "Similarly, this amendment also allows the Ordinary Account (OA) savings of other co-owners whether it is their children, parents, or siblings to help pay for the HPS premiums of insured members who have run out of OA savings. This additional flexibility will help to reduce the risk of lapsed insurance covers due to non-payment of premiums and this is especially so when members are facing financial challenges because this is exactly what they need and home ownership, as we all know, is the key tenets for retirement adequacy.",
            "HPS, as a mortgage-reducing insurance gives members peace of mind that protects them and their families against losing their homes in the event of death or permanent incapacity before their housing loans are paid up. So, as have mentioned, those facing financial difficulties and hence perhaps will have challenges to keep up with their HPS payments with their OA savings being low, this change will allow them to get help from co-owners and not have them have to trade-off not paying the premium hence leading to a policy lapse.",
            "I have personally seen this happened when a family had their policy lapsed and they did not even know that the member had purchased the HPS. When he passed on, they then realised that he actually lapsed on his policy. It is quite sad because they still had to provide for the family and they still had to ensure that that is the time when you need – you are grieving and homeownership is one aspect. You have had that addressed. That gives the remaining family members a peace of mind.",
            "Medisave – Medisave I think for many Singaporeans is the fund for our and our immediate family's medical and future medical needs: hospitalisation, day surgery and other expenses. It is therefore important and I am glad that this change looks to safeguard members' Medisave monies. Our Ministers shared that there are not many cases. I think it is every case to any person whose Medisave Funds are important is one case too many, as we all know. So, I am glad that this change is being done because what it does is it not only sets aside the penalty framework, it also mandates the recovery of Medisave monies from the Medical Institutions (MI) as well as the Approved Insurers (AI) for those that have been mistakenly deducted as well as refunds for monies from the institutions due to uncompleted medical treatments.",
            "The proposed amendments to the CPF Act are welcomed as they will benefit members with greater flexibility and enhance support and protection in the use of their CPF funds to build their retirement adequacy. It does not however address the frustration that members have expressed with regard to the complexity and the changes in the CPF schemes when they do happen. This uncertainty does lead to angst and mistrust of the scheme; and the irony of offering more choice in the usage of members CPF monies is that it adds to the complexity of the scheme.",
            "To achieve simplicity is a very difficult balance but CPF Board must continue to work on this. CPF is and will continue to be an integral part of the retirement adequacy for Singaporeans. The Ministry must continue to find effective channels to communicate and provide more timely and specific information to enable members to better understand the CPF schemes and changes as well as appropriate financial counselling. This will ensure that members have a good understanding and can make informed choices that are best suited for each of their retirement needs. Sir, I support the Bill."

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I thank Members Jessica Tan, Dennis Tan and Pritam Singh for speaking in support of the amendment.",
            "First, on the issue of the Home Protection Scheme, I share the sentiments of the Members, that, it is very important that we do whatever we can to help to minimise the risk of losing a home when the homeowner passes away. At the end of the day, it is very hard to keep a family together without a place to stay in. So, in that regard, we are very concerned that on the average every year, we see about 4000 to 5000 policy holders dropping out of the HPS due to various reasons.",
            "On the part of the MOM and CPF, we are doing what we can to minimise or reduce these cases of lapses. The amendment today we believe will help may be 1,000 to 2,000 CPF members to overcome the inability of the homeowner to pay the premium.",
            "Having said so, we also continue to step-up our efforts to remind and educate the homeowners of the importance of HPS. Mr Pritam Singh asked about cases where we paid the HPS claims even though we are not liable to do so. Here, I would like to give an illustration.",
            "A policyholder fell sick; seriously ill and was hospitalised at the time when the premium payment was due. As a result, he was not able to take action knowingly or unknowingly, to pay for the premium, and subsequently, he either passed away or suffered permanent disability. So, under such circumstances, CPF could have taken the position that since the policyholder did not pay for the premium, as a result, the policy has lapsed.",
            "But we think that will be a wrong thing to do because the fact that the policyholder was not able to pay the premium was beyond his control. He was hospitalised at the time of the renewal. So, these are examples whereby the Board has exercised its judgment, knowing that if this is really beyond the control of the policyholder, in fact, we will find a way to pay them rather than to reject the claims.",
            "Mr Pritam Singh asked what kinds of serious illnesses would we exclude an application due to pre-existing illnesses. For example, a homeowner who suffers from cancer, kidney failure, or heart disorder and so on, the Board does look at the severity of the illness because if it is too severe and will lead clearly towards terminal illnesses, then I think we would have no choice but to reject such applications. Because at the end of the day, we would have to strike a balance between taking care of as many homeowners as we can and yet at the same time, be fair to the other homeowners, bearing in mind that this is a risk-pooling programme.",
            "Mr Pritam Singh also asked whether we can step up our efforts to send early reminders. The answer is yes. In fact today, not only would we remind every new homeowner – when they collect the keys from the HDB – of the importance of HPS, we also make sure that for any case of a lapsed payment, we would follow up with a repeated reminder. Obviously, more can be done; and we will keep doing more.",
            "Mr Dennis Tan asked whether we can expand HPS to private housing. Mr Deputy Speaker, HPS' primary focus would be on HDB housing to cover the vast majority of home owners and the mass market. For owners of private properties, our advice to them, is to take care of themselves by purchasing mortgage-reducing insurance in the private market.",
            "Mr Tan asked whether we can be more specific with the definition of terminal illnesses and total permanent disability. All these are defined under the CPF Act and I would like to confirm that he is right that terminal illness, by and large refers to a remaining lifespan of less than one year. In the case of total permanent disability, it refers to a loss of two eyes, two limbs or one eye and one limb.",
            "Mr Dennis Tan also asked for section (39) regarding premium with interest: this refers to cases where the policyholder did not declare their serious pre-existing illnesses. So, at the time of claim, when it was discovered that the claim was not supportable, we will refund the remaining premium together with interest.",
            "Ms Jessica Tan touched on a few important points. First, regarding the Payout Eligibility Age (PEA). I share her concern that each time, when the PEA is adjusted, it will affect the retirement planning of those CPF members who were affected. And this is the reason why we take the review of PEA very seriously. The last time we made a revision to the PEA was in 2007, when we raised the PEA from the age of 62 to 65. We phased in this increase of 62 to 65 over 10 years.",
            "It was announced in 2007 and the final adjustment of going up from age 64 to 65 will only take place in 2018, which is about two years from now. I agree with Ms Jessica Tan that this is a very major decision and should we decide to amend the PEA, we should do so by giving policyholders and CPF members enough advance notice.",
            "Let me say this, right now, we are on schedule to raise the PEA to age 65 by 2018. At the same time, I want to highlight to this House that since January this year, CPF members have the option of deferring the start of their CPF payouts from the PEA up to the age of 70. In other words, if a CPF member is in employment and he does not need to start his payouts at the age of 64 now and 65 come 2018, he has the option of deferring the starting of his pay-out up to the age of 70. For every year of deferment, he is expected to receive about 6% more every month permanently from the date of the pay-out.",
            "We believe that the combination of progressively raising the PEA to age 65 by 2018, coupled with the new flexibility of each member being able to, on a voluntary basis, defer the payout start age to age 70, is about the right combination – providing the kind of flexibility that the members are looking for.",
            "I also agree with Ms Jessica Tan regarding Medisave claims that are unauthorised or made by mistake. In fact, we are stepping up our efforts and one of our objectives for this amendment is to send a very clear message to medical institutions and approved insurers that we take this seriously. Whenever we discover any case of error, first, we mandate the recovery. And second, with this amendment, CPF Board will have the rights to impose administrative penalties as well.",
            "Last, but not least, Ms Jessica Tan also suggested to step up our communications. Again, I fully agree. In fact, CPF Board is not only going to do more, we are going to do more in a simpler way so that more members out there can understand what is the purpose of CPF, why is it structured this way and what are the changes that are coming along the way to ensure that the CPF system will always be relevant and will always be able to meet their needs better. With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move."

This presents a conundrum for members as it is normally compulsory for all members servicing their HDB loans through their CPF accounts. Can the Minister please confirm whether such members will merely be exempted from the scheme without any coverage from the scheme after the amendment?",
            "Even if such members are exempted from the scheme, will the Minister consider allowing a special form of coverage under the scheme, perhaps on a case-by-case basis, and even perhaps on a different premium? This will certainly give a better piece of mind to affected members. After all, surely the original intention of the scheme is to provide a piece of mind to all members who have taken loans to pay for their HDB flats. Thank you."

          "content": [
            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"",
            "Over the years, MAS has consistently held our banks to stringent capital and liquidity standards. This approach has served us well, as Singapore's banking system has remained resilient in the face of the global financial crisis of 2008.",
            "Following the crisis, MAS has been actively involved in coordinated efforts among international regulators to strengthen capital and liquidity standards for banks, and to create a more robust international banking system. Likewise within Singapore, MAS has been refining the regulatory and supervisory framework to strengthen the resilience of our financial institutions and to enhance the stability of the financial system as a whole, so this Banking (Amendment) Bill forms part of the overall effort.",
            "MAS has consulted extensively with the industry and the public on the policy changes and the draft Bill. It has studied the feedback received and incorporated it into the Bill where appropriate.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, I will now go through the three broad areas of amendments in the Bill.",
            "First, to strengthen prudential safeguards and enhance depositor protection. Currently, a foreign bank can choose to operate in Singapore as a branch or a locally-incorporated subsidiary. A bank branch will rely on support from its head office, which is subject to capital and other requirements imposed by its home regulator on a group basis. In contrast, a locally-incorporated subsidiary will have its own capital, and be subject to MAS' capital and other regulatory requirements.",
            "The Bill will empower MAS to require a foreign bank branch to incorporate all or part of its banking business, where it is in the interest of the public, the bank's depositors, or the domestic financial system. This new regulatory power forms part of the suite of policy measures for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs). This was announced by MAS in April last year. In retail banking in particular, a bank with significant retail presence – defined as having more than 3% of resident non-bank deposits, and more than 150,000 deposit accounts with balances below S$250,000 – will be designated a D-SIB and be required to subsidiarise its retail operations. The subsidiary will then be subject to MAS' own regulatory requirements, based on its risk profile.",
            "The Bill will also empower MAS to impose prudential requirements that cap banks' leverage and ensure that they maintain sufficient liquidity. As I mentioned earlier, MAS has always maintained high standards of prudential regulation and supervision for our banks; in fact, somewhat higher than in most other jurisdictions. Over the years, we have developed a system of regulation that allows well-managed risk-taking and innovation, ensuring the stable and sustainable development of the financial services sector. This Bill will update our rules to reflect new international standards, which MAS has been involved in shaping through its participation in various international financial forums.",
            "The second purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the corporate governance of banks. Effective corporate governance plays a critical role in ensuring robust risk management, decision-making and accountability within banks. The Bill will vest MAS with the power to direct a bank to remove key appointment holders, including its chief executive officer and deputy chief executive officer, if they are found not to be fit and proper. The grounds of removal will be aligned with the criteria for approving their appointments. To enhance MAS' oversight of these appointments, the Bill will require banks to notify MAS as soon as they become aware of any material information which may negatively affect the fitness or propriety of any director or executive officer whose appointment was approved by MAS.",
            "The Bill will also repeal the provision that makes bank directors jointly and severally liable for any bank losses arising from credit facilities or exposures to the directors and their related parties. This provision was intended to emphasise the fiduciary duty bank directors owed to their bank. However, based on feedback provided by the banks, this provision discourages candidates from taking up bank directorships and more importantly, MAS has also assessed that it does not provide effective oversight over banks' related party transactions (RPTs).",
            "Instead, to address the potential conflicts of interest arising from RPTs, MAS will require a bank to conduct all such transactions on an arm's length basis and to obtain board approval before entering into such transactions that pose material risks to the bank. The Bill will also enhance MAS' powers to direct a bank to terminate, prohibit and restrict transactions that the bank enters into with its related parties, if these are deemed detrimental to depositors' interests.",
            "The Bill will also enhance corporate governance of banks by reinforcing the complementary role of external auditors in assessing a bank's risks and internal controls. This will be done through a few key measures such as the introduction of a safe harbour provision to protect banks' external auditors from liability where they disclose confidential information to MAS as part of their reporting obligations under the Banking Act. Furthermore, MAS will be empowered to direct a bank to remove its external auditors if they have not discharged their statutory duties satisfactorily.",
            "Third, to reinforce banks' risk management controls. This is the third broad area of amendments. These amendments will formalise MAS' expectation that banks establish risk management systems and controls that are commensurate with their business profiles and operations. MAS will be able to impose penalties on banks that fail to do so.",
            "The Bill will also require banks to seek MAS' approval to establish new places of business where certain non-banking activities, such as money-changing and remittance business, are conducted. This will allow MAS to exercise better oversight of banks' activities at such locations. For example, MAS will be able to require a bank to institute adequate safeguards against money laundering and terrorism financing, before it can commence money-changing and remittance businesses at new locations.",
            "Besides these three broad areas which I have just outlined, there are also several significant amendments to update the banking regulatory framework.",
            "First, the Bill will introduce a requirement for banks to immediately inform MAS of adverse developments that may materially affect them. In the case of a bank incorporated in Singapore, this extends to any adverse developments that may materially affect related entities of the bank. This will allow MAS to take the necessary supervisory action in a timely manner.",
            "Second, the Bill will empower MAS to inspect the local and overseas subsidiaries of a bank incorporated in Singapore. It will also allow the parent supervisory authority of a foreign bank or merchant bank to inspect all financial activities of the bank or merchant bank in Singapore, upon MAS' approval. So, the parent based overseas can inspect the financial activities of the bank or merchant bank in Singapore, subject to MAS' approval. These changes will facilitate the consolidated supervision of internationally active banks and merchant banks.",
            "Finally, amendments have been made to rationalise the penalty provisions for the contravention of the various requirements in the Act.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a sound and progressive financial sector will create a strong foundation for sustainable economic growth. These amendments to the Banking Act will help strengthen the banking industry and align our regulatory regime with international best practices. Sir, I beg to move.",
            "Question proposed."

        {
          "speaker": "Mr Leon Perera",
          "content": [
            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, it is important for the MAS to be sufficiently empowered to take a proactive stance in regulating the banking sector. The global financial crisis showed the world how high the stakes are in getting our banking regulatory frameworks right.",
            "Prudential safeguards, such as, for example, empowering the MAS to require a bank to incorporate locally in certain cases, only allowing fit and proper people to own significant stakes in banks, or to be a controller of the bank and providing safe harbour protection for external auditors who whistle blow. All these will enhance the ability of the MAS to protect banking customers, as well as the stability and safety of the overall banking system.",
            "Having said this, we must ensure the continued competitiveness of our banking sector. Singapore's financial services sector makes a very significant contribution to jobs and GDP in Singapore. Regulations should be framed and implemented in such a way as to minimise ambiguity. This would ensure that banks do not \"overegg the pudding\" so as to drive up compliance costs that could end up being passed onto the end-customers of banking products, not to mention crimp the job-creation engine of the sector, however slightly.",
            "In this context, while supporting the Bill, I would like to pose a few clarifying questions and make some suggestions with respect to implementing specific provisions of the Bill.",
            "The Bill imposes new requirements and expanded penalties for engaging in related party transactions that are detrimental to the interests of depositors, including non-exposure transactions. If the MAS uses this power to direct a bank to terminate a transaction with its related party, for example, that act could conceivably result in a financial loss much bigger than the $250,000 fine that is associated with this provision. Such a decision could also inflict reputational damage on the bank.",
            "In relation to this provision – clause 17 – there is a risk that if banks do not clearly understand the guidelines which the MAS will use to exercise its power to terminate transactions or eliminate exposures, this may create a culture of excessive notification and consultation with the MAS at best, or excessive risk-aversion at worst.",
            "The Bill also requires banks to immediately notify MAS of any developments that would adversely and materially affect its financial soundness, reputation and ability to conduct business.",
            "In relation to this provision – clause 34 – there is a risk that if the banks do not clearly understand what needs to be and what does not need to be reported to the MAS, this will create a burden of excessive notification which may raise compliance costs, however slightly. And these compliance costs may end up being passed onto end-consumers.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in respect of these two provisions – clause 17 and clause 34 – I would like to ask if the MAS will provide banks with guidelines that it will use to determine what constitutes a transaction or exposure that could be potentially terminated by the MAS and what constitutes a notifiable material development. Will the MAS, for instance, be publishing a guidance document on how it will operationalise these powers, similar to the guidance published on anti-money laundering and terrorism finance last year and private banking controls in 2014.",
            "Moving onto the next part of my speech, there are certain provisions in the Bill which I do not oppose. Nevertheless, these provisions would give the MAS additional powers over banks and in some cases these powers may lengthen the turnaround time for decisions, limit business flexibility and therefore raise the cost of doing business, however slightly.",
            "Therefore, in the interest of transparency, I would like to pose some questions to better understand – and for the banking community and stakeholders to better understand – the Government's thinking in relation to these issues and to ask what facts prompted the Government to include these provisions in the Bill. This information may be relevant to other national sectors, than just the banking sector.",
            "Clause 46, which inserts a new section 57EA, requires banks, credit and charge card issuers to obtain approval from the MAS for places where they intend to conduct certain businesses.",
            "I would like to ask what facts or trends have prompted the Government to impose a requirement that banks seek the approval of MAS for these decisions, as opposed to just notifying the MAS. It would be helpful for the public to better understand what facts the MAS is detecting about such practices by banking businesses as it may have implications for other sectors of society.",
            "For instance, is the MAS detecting overly aggressive marketing practices for credit or charge cards that may be fuelling unsustainable over-spending by at-risk families? If so, it would be useful to highlight this. NGOs and VWOs working with at-risk families and at-risk individuals could help to provide feedback to the MAS if they notice such unhealthy card marketing practices on the ground. This could help the MAS to decide which locations are appropriate locations to allow credit or charge card-related or marketing activities, for example.",
            "The Bill also requires banks to seek MAS approval for changing locations or adding locations for non-banking activities, including money-changing and remittance services, as the Minister observed in his speech earlier. Unlike wealth management products under the Financial Advisers Act with risk of capital loss, money-changing and remittance are considered non-banking activities. Once again, I would like to ask what facts or trends have prompted the Government to impose a requirement that banks seek the approval of MAS for locations choice for these non-banking activities, as opposed to just notifying the MAS. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with that, I support the Bill."

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak today. To Mr Leon Perera's point on having cards institutions needing to seek the approval of MAS for conduct of business in certain jurisdictions, I actually support the point because my credit card just had a charge from Azerbaijan and I have no idea how it came forth. So, I do support MAS on putting in more controls on credit cards companies' places of business.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak today on some recent developments in our local business and SME funding landscape. These past few years have seen the rise of new financing arrangements and initiatives, providing businesses with alternatives to obtaining loans from banks or personal contacts. The specific arrangements that I would like to focus on today are the peer-to-peer lending platforms, or P2P platforms for short.",
            "Very briefly, a company that wants to take a loan approaches the platform, which then offers the opportunity to its members. Members can choose to offer as much or as little as they are comfortable lending, within the guidelines of the platform. The platform will then aggregate contributions from many individual lenders into one single large loan to the company.",
            "Such services are growing rapidly globally. According to PwC, the US P2P lending market is expected to grow from US$5.5 billion in loans issued in 2014 to US$150 billion in 2025. Growth in the UK has been similarly explosive, with business P2P lending growing sevenfold from £200 million in 2013 to £1.5 billion in 2015. In Singapore, there are at least 5 such sites, which have collectively raised more than $10 million for their clients in 2015.",
            "P2P lending is an example of the transformative power of the Internet – the business model simply could not work without fast and efficient communication and the ability to transact with multiple individuals. They benefit both sides. For upcoming businesses, it opens up new channels for funding, given that banks are typically reluctant to lend to companies with a limited track record.",
            "Harnessing the \"wisdom of crowds\", individual lenders offering smaller sums could be better at allocating capital towards future potential, thereby improving the odds of success for the start-ups and SMEs that we need to drive our economy forward. For lenders, such platforms offer a rare chance for them to earn higher returns on their money, typically above 10%, albeit with higher risks.",
            "However, as with any new financial innovations, this raises concern about the appropriate extent of regulation, in order to both safeguard the financial system and protect the interests of lenders. MAS is currently in the process of drafting the required regulations, and hence the platforms are effectively operating in a regulatory vacuum. We understand, of course, that the speed of innovation can make it challenging for the regulatory authorities to keep up. At the same time, an appropriate regulatory regime is urgently needed to reduce uncertainty and maximise benefits for all parties.",
            "What are the key elements of an appropriate regulatory framework for P2P lending? If we start from the perspective of risks, P2P lending seems unlikely to be a source of systemic threat to the overall banking system in Singapore, at least for now, giving that they are still small in comparison to commercial banks. The greatest risk therefore falls on the individual lenders, who risk losing all or part of their investment if the loan goes into default before the principal is repaid. How should we protect such individuals without inadvertently introducing moral hazard by creating the impression that such loans are iron-clad and can never go wrong?",
            "The key piece of regulation should focus on preventing fraud by the platform. We need to ensure that the platforms are legitimate and are not operating pyramid schemes or funnelling funds towards uses other than what the individual lenders signed up for.",
            "This brings to mind China's Ezubao P2P lending scheme for example, turned out to be a US$7.6 billion Ponzi scheme. On the other hand, we need to ensure that the platforms have systems in place to prevent money laundering. This suggests the need for a licensing regime, to ensure that the proper processes and accountability systems are in place at the platforms. A clear licensing regime helps reduce uncertainty and ambiguity on the part of the platforms. However, given that these companies will often be themselves start-ups, the requirements should not be so onerous as to stifle innovation.",
            "Regulations should not go so far as to eliminate all risk from the transaction, as that would itself create unhealthy behaviours as people chase high interest rates while assuming they will be protected should something go wrong. There is also the need to balance access and protection – if, as has been proposed, we restrict participation to Accredited Investors or Institutions, we would be protecting the average man in the street, but also preventing them from accessing a potentially beneficial asset class. Here, we can take inspiration from the various consumer protection rules already in place across the financial industry, such as \"cooling off periods\" where they can change their minds without penalty. This will hopefully reduce the risk that retail investors might invest in inappropriate products.",
            "One key area is to ensure that the lenders are able to collectively pursue action should there be a default, just as any institutional creditor would. Each individual share may be too small to find it worthwhile to bear the cost and effort of pursuing a claim – hence, collective instruments for protecting the interests of all lenders need to be put in place. Perhaps we could explore making the platforms pay part of their revenues into a national fund to create an industry body that can help lenders pursue their claims.",
            "We have also seen that some peer-to-peer lenders in developed countries, such as Zopa in the UK, proactively designate a portion of their funds to provide a form of insurance to safeguard the interests of lenders in the event of a default. By addressing the concerns of potential lenders, this will, in turn, help convince more to participate and accelerate the growth of the industry.",
            "Like it or not, technological innovation in the financial industry is going to grow, and we should not stand in the way of initiatives that facilitate the creation of good businesses and jobs. Given that economic dark clouds are gathering, it is particularly key to maintain financing channels for SMEs, which are often not a target segment for major banks, as this could serve as a lifeline in tough times. What is important is to make sure the public is well-informed and that the peer-to-peer lenders operate in a regulatory environment that provides clear guidelines without being overly burdensome. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill."

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members for their comments and their support of the Bill.",
            "I would, first, address Mr Leon Perera's point about finding the right balance. I fully agree with the Member that there is a need to find a balance between ensuring adequate prudential safeguards and ensuring the competitiveness of the financial sector in Singapore. I hope the Member agrees that we have, in fact, been doing so over the past few years, and we have managed it, I think, better than most other financial jurisdictions, if you look at it. After the financial crisis in 2008, we saw many global financial institutions downsizing their global operations significantly. Singapore has not been spared, but I would say, if you look at the scale of the downsizing at the international level, the impact on Singapore has been relatively contained.",
            "In fact, our financial sector continued to post healthy employment gains in recent years. We have added 3,600 new jobs over the first three quarters of 2015 − 3,600 new jobs on a net basis over the first three quarters of 2015 − which shows that while we have taken a path to find a balance with adequate strong safeguards, I think we also ensure that our financial sector is competitive and able to retain good jobs and generate good jobs for Singaporeans.",
            "On the other points that the Member raised, I will address them specifically. On new requirements, he mentioned clauses 17 and 34 on related party transactions and the need for guidelines and the concerns over burden and compliance costs. MAS has been very mindful of ensuring that it does not add unnecessary compliance costs for banks, and that is why I am coming up with this set of amendments. MAS consulted the industry extensively and, where appropriate, had indeed made adjustments to the requirements.",
            "For example, as I mentioned just now, on the related party transaction provisions, we are not just adding more rules but we have, in fact, repealed an existing provision that makes bank directors jointly and severally liable for the bank losses arising from credit facilities or exposures to their directors and their related parties. So, we have repealed an existing provision which we have assessed to be not so effective. Instead, we have put in place other requirements to ensure and safeguard against related party transactions. MAS will certainly be mindful of implementing this well and providing sufficient transition time to the banks to make sure that they are able to have sufficient time to transit to meet the new requirements.",
            "Mr Perera had suggested having prescribed guidelines or detailed guidelines. MAS will consider this, but it is not always possible to prescribe each and every scenario where there are related party transactions, because there could be many circumstances under which they can happen. So, in some instances, it may be based on principles that are set out and adequate consultation and engagement will be done with the banks to ensure that they are able to implement. That is the same approach we will take with regard to the initiatives or new provisions that Mr Perera had highlighted. He mentioned clause 46 with regard to place of business and concerns that this may raise cost of doing business. He also asked whether there were any trends, in particular, that had sparked off such a new provision.",
            "Sir, the new provisions that had been put in place were not so much in response to any particular new trends that had emerged but really with regard to looking at how MAS can provide better oversight over non-banking businesses conducted by the banks. MAS is looking at how we can do it in a more comprehensive way and to, again, ensure that we maintain our high prudential standards. The Member had suggested that this can be done just through notification. But notification alone may not be sufficient for MAS and will not give MAS the powers to act just on the basis of a notification. Whereas with this amendment, MAS will now have more powers, more ability, to ensure that prudential standards are in place and to also supervise the conduct of non-banking businesses.",
            "These are new and necessary measures that are needed to ensure that our prudential standards are maintained and held to a high standard. I would also add that many of the new measures that are being proposed are not just being done by MAS alone, but they are also measures that are done internationally. These are not done unilaterally by us, but they are measures that have been discussed in international financial forums which MAS has been active in. MAS has also played an active role in shaping these international standards, which are progressively being implemented in other jurisdictions as well.",
            "Mr Ong Teng Koon had talked about a new area of risk on peer-to-peer lending. It is potentially a benefit as well as an opportunity but, as he highlighted, it is also a new area of risk. I should, at the outset, clarify that P2P activities are not directly within the scope of the Banking Act, which focuses on the regulatory framework for banks involved in the business of taking deposits and lending funds. So, P2P lending may not be directly covered within the scope of the Banking Act. This is an area which is new, and it is a new form of financing globally. Within Singapore it is still at a nascent stage but it is an area which is gaining more interest and attention, and we are certainly paying attention to it.",
            "As the Member had noted, while these platforms add to the diversity of the financial landscape, investors participating in P2P platforms should be aware of the risks, and there are considerable risks involved. These include risks that the crowdfunding proposals may be fraudulent or that the promised returns do not materialise. Also, it is because crowdfunding is commonly used by start-up businesses to raise funds for the initial stages of a business cycle, lenders would also be exposed to the higher failure rates associated with start-ups. So, these are the risks involved in P2P lending.",
            "The regulatory framework for P2P lending must therefore address both the risks posed by such platforms, and strike a balance between that and allowing for innovation. So, we must strike a balance between investor protection and innovation. And that is why with this balance in mind, MAS had put out a consultation paper that the Member had alluded to. This was done in February last year. It was a consultation paper on securities-based crowdfunding. MAS had proposed to facilitate such securities-based crowdfunding offerings to accredited investors and institutional investors in the first instance; but not to retail investors because they may not fully appreciate the risks involved in P2P lending.",
            "Sir, I would like to thank the Members for their comments. I believe I have addressed their questions and I hope that Members will support the amendment Bill that is being tabled.",
            "For our financial system to remain stable and secure and to support economic development, the banking sector must be well-managed and remain resilient to shocks. That is the objective of the Banking Act amendments we have proposed today."

            "The Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill 2016, or the GST Bill in short, was released for public consultation in July last year. The Bill provides for three amendments, which arose from our ongoing review of the GST regime. The Ministry of Finance has evaluated the feedback received from the public consultation and, where appropriate, adopted the suggestions. Let me now explain the three amendments in turn.",
            "First, allowing the Comptroller of GST to impose Travel Restriction Orders on persons who have wrongly claimed tourist refunds. The Comptroller of GST currently already has the power to impose Travel Restriction Orders on persons who fail to pay GST owed to the Government. Once such an order is imposed, the relevant person owing the GST generally will not be allowed to leave Singapore unless he pays the GST owed. This amendment expands this power to cover cases of persons who make wrongful GST tourist refund claims.",
            "Under the GST Tourist Refund Scheme, only eligible tourists are allowed to claim a refund of the GST paid on goods purchased in and brought out of Singapore. To be eligible for tourist refunds, the individual must meet certain conditions, for example, he or she must not be a Singaporean citizen or Permanent Resident, nor a crew member of an aircraft or ship, and is not employed in Singapore.",
            "Where a tourist refund is wrongly claimed by a person and not repaid to the Comptroller, clause 3 of the Bill now allows the Comptroller to impose Travel Restrictions on the person. This change will not affect the local tourism industry, as genuine tourists remain eligible to claim the GST refunds and will not be affected by the change.",
            "Second, clause 2 rationalises the definition of aircraft to make it clear when zero-rating of specified supplies relating to aircrafts will apply. Under the current legislation, supplies relating to an aircraft qualify for GST zero-rating if the aircraft is not used or not intended to be used for recreation or pleasure. If the aircraft is used or intended to be used for recreation or pleasure, then it must be wholly used, or intended to be wholly used, for international travel. The Bill removes the reference to whether the aircraft is used for recreation or pleasure.",
            "This amendment makes clear the policy intent of zero-rating supplies relating to international travel on the basis that they are not for domestic consumption. The revised definition will refer to all aircraft that is wholly used or intended to be wholly used for international travel, or any military aircraft.",
            "Clause 2 also extends the GST zero-rating to supplies relating to international flights. Currently, supplies such as fuel and aircraft handling services are zero-rated, for GST purposes, only if they were supplied in relation to aircraft that is wholly used for international travel.",
            "The amendment will extend zero-rating of GST to specific supplies made in relation to any aircraft that is not wholly used or not intended to be wholly used for international travel, as long as the supplies can be specifically attributable to international flights. In essence, for such an aircraft, the relevant question will be whether the particular flight for which the specified supplies relate to is an international flight.",
            "The final amendment is a technical amendment to make it clear that zero-rating of GST applies to the supply of the goods which are for use as merchandise for retail sale on board an aircraft or ship. Clause 2 of the Bill gives effect to this change. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move."

            "The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2016, or the Bill in short, covers income tax changes announced in the 2015 Budget Statement, as well as other changes arising from the periodic review of our income tax regime.",
            "The draft Bill was released for public consultation exercise from 26 June to 24 July 2015. MOF has evaluated all the feedback received and where relevant, accepted suggestions.",
            "Sir, the tax changes announced in the 2015 Budget Statement have already been debated in this House. These changes are in line with ongoing efforts by the Committee on the Future Economy. In particular, there will be even greater support to help companies grow and scale through internationalisation. Let me highlight the key changes.",
            "First, to help spur mergers and acquisitions so that companies, especially SMEs, can acquire scale, attract talent and compete effectively overseas, the Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) scheme will be extended for another five years. The tax allowance for acquisitions costs will also be increased, from the current 5% to 25% of the value of acquisition, with the cap on allowance remaining at $5 million for each Year of Assessment (YA). The final shareholding interest in a company to qualify an acquisition for M&A benefits will be lowered. Subject to conditions, companies would be able to claim M&A benefits for acquisitions resulting in at least 20% shareholding in the target company, down from the current threshold of 50% shareholding. Clause 24 of the Bill provides for the changes.",
            "Second, to provide greater support to businesses expanding overseas, the Double Tax Deduction for Internationalisation scheme has been enhanced to cover salaries incurred for Singaporeans posted to newly set-up or acquired entities overseas.",
            "Third, a new tax incentive, the International Growth Scheme, has also been introduced to provide support to Singapore companies in their internationalisation efforts. This incentive will help Singapore companies transform their businesses and explore new areas of growth. It will also provide opportunities to help more Singaporeans gain international exposure for their work. Qualifying companies will enjoy a 10% concessionary tax rate on their incremental income from internationalisation activities, such as income derived from the export of goods and services or from global or regional HQ-related activities. This will encourage more Singapore companies to expand overseas, while anchoring their key business activities in Singapore. The enhancement to the Double Tax Deduction scheme and the introduction of the International Growth Scheme are provided for in Clauses 18 and 34 of the Bill respectively.",
            "Fourth, to enhance progressivity and strengthen future revenues, the personal income tax rates for tax resident individuals will be increased. Specifically, the top marginal tax rate will be raised by two percentage points, from 20% to 22% for those with a chargeable income above $320,000. There will also be smaller adjustments to the marginal tax rates for chargeable income between $160,000 and $320,000. This change will take effect for income earned in 2016, in other words from YA 2017. Clause 50 provides for these changes.",
            "Fifth, the tax deduction for donations has been increased from 250% to 300% in 2015, as part of the SG50 Jubilee celebrations. The 250% tax deduction for donations, which was to expire at the end of 2015, has also been extended for another three years till the end of 2018, to instil a culture of giving. This is provided for in Clause 22 of the Bill.",
            "Sir, the Ministry of Finance regularly reviews and refines the income tax regime. I shall now outline two other key changes arising from MOF's periodic review of the tax regime.",
            "The first change is that we will exempt from tax, up to $400,000 of the amount either deemed withdrawn under the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) upon death of the SRS member or withdrawn in full on the ground of terminal illness or disease. This will ensure parity on the amount of SRS savings that could have been withdrawn tax-free, had the amount been withdrawn over the full 10-year withdrawal period. The change, which takes effect from YA 2016, ensures that the SRS member is not unduly disadvantaged in the event of death, terminal illness or disease, and is provided for in clauses 7, 38 and 39 of the Bill.",
            "The second amendment is to align the personal income tax rate for non-tax-resident individuals that is currently pegged to the highest resident marginal personal income tax rate, to the new top income tax rate for tax resident individuals, of 22%. This change will take effect from Year of Assessment 2017. Clause 26 provides for this change. At the same time, the withholding tax rate for non-resident individuals which is currently pegged to the highest resident marginal personal income tax rate will also be aligned to 22%. This change will take effect from 1 January 2016. Clauses 35, 36, 38 and 39 provide for this change.",

            "Building a ready, resilient and relevant financial sector workforce is of importance because the financial sector is a strong contributor to our economic growth, our productivity growth and our growing influence and impact as a regional and global financial hub and centre. This is further accentuated by the fact that the sector is powered by a 170,000 strong workforce and whose productivity is one of the highest across various sectors and where Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) form the majority of the workforce.",
            "All the recent announcements about layoffs, wage freezes and lacklustre performance of global banking giants in the financial sector has fuelled global and local fears, uncertainties and doubts in the financial sector. This is further exacerbated by the plunge in crude oil prices, currency fluctuations and stock markets at new lows in the first two months of this year which all have ripple effects on the financial sector whether it is demand on banking, finance, insurance, asset management services as well as stresses on loans and loan repayments.",
            "National retrenchment figures have also crept up in 2015 compared with 2014. At NTUC, we are also seeing more PMEs from the financial sector visit our U PME Centre to seek assistance since the last quarter of 2015.",
            "Standard Chartered announced in November last year that it plans to lay off 15,000 workers from its 86,000 strong global workforce by 2018. In Singapore alone, Standard Chartered employs 7,000 workers, many of whom are Singaporeans. HSBC had also announced it would slash 50,000 jobs worldwide through 2017 as part of a global overhaul. Credit Suisse also announced 4,000 job cuts globally after the Swiss bank reported its first annual loss since the global financial crisis just weeks ago. In January, Barclays also had to let go some of its employees as part of its move to exit the global institutional cash equities, equity research and equities capital market businesses. In fact, two weeks ago, I met up with 10 of those who were retrenched in January. I share their worries, fears and concerns.",
            "Why is this happening in the financial sector? There are many answers to that question: too rapid expansion; too high cost of manpower and rent; restructuring and re-calibration; product consolidation hence the closure of major product lines; technological disruption of Financial Technology and the overall global economic outlook.",
            "These are just some of the reasons why foreign financial institutions are hitting rough patches. Notwithstanding, jobs were being created in the financial industry especially in growth areas within the sector such as in the areas of compliance, risk management and IT.",
            "It is heartening to note from recent financial results of our three local banks – UOB, DBS and OCBC – that they are profitable in 2015 and still healthy, stable and are reportedly still hiring and not expected to undertake drastic headcount cuts.",
            "Staying ready, resilient and relevant involves not just individuals and workers per se but include our unions, employers, Government, regulators and key stakeholders partnering in the journey.",
            "What do you mean by ready? Ready means that we are prepared for anything that comes our way. It also means we can change and adapt in fluid, volatile, new and changing environment and circumstances.",
            "What does resilient mean? It does not mean that a person does not experience difficulty or distress but that he or she has the power and ability to \"bounce back\" and recover quickly after weathering any challenges or adversity.",
            "Relevant means staying abreast and even ahead of current developments and possessing the needed skills, learning and mindset to remain updated, current and both employed and employable.",
            "How to Build a 3R Workforce in the Financial Sector? Building a ready, resilient and relevant workforce – a 3R Workforce – requires beyond individual efforts to collective efforts by every individual and each of the tripartite partners.",
            "NTUC's Financial and Business Services cluster of unions recently ran a series of focus group sessions and engaged more than 100 employees working in the financial sector from various financial institutions and in various job roles and grades. Workers and unions all agree that the financial sector landscape is changing rapidly.",
            "New jobs are being created with the advent of digital age and disruptive technology. They are what is now called 3G jobs; \"3G\" meaning \"going, going, gone\".",
            "Workers in this sector need to stay proactive and positive. Proactive to upskill to move up and stay ahead. Proactive to deep skill to attain personal mastery. Proactive to re-skill if old jobs are gone and new technology and ways of doing things are introduced. Proactive to second skill themselves in case they need to move out or across to a new job. Positive to embrace change, stay in control and ahead of the challenges coming their way and overcome any adversity.",
            "We want to ensure careers do not plateau because workers have stopped growing, stopped learning and stopped adapting. Unions too, need to support, assist and encourage fellow workers and secure a positive environment and system for the worker to stay employed and employable. During this time of economic restructuring and transformation and amidst cyclical and structural challenges, besides ensuring that workers in this sector are protected and represented, unions need to strive to stay relevant, progressive and ahead in light of the changing workforce profile and employment landscape. Many in this sector are not aware of the latest and upcoming changes to labour legislation, and that PMEs too can be union members and enjoy the protection and entire host of services which NTUC and our affiliated unions can provide.",
            "In the same vein, employers in the financial sector play a vital role in building a 3R workforce. It is imperative for employers to ensure they are Progressive in Practice and create Progression Pathways and build the Singaporean Core. Employers need pay close attention to training, exposure and coaching to equip workers with skills to advance to better jobs. Employers need to motivate and empower more uptake of training opportunities. Employers also need to provide a clear progression path upward for employees who develop and demonstrate skills, capabilities and competencies.",
            "The recent rise in layoffs in the banking sector affects the Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) the hardest. Anecdotally, many of those laid off are the mature, above 40 years, experienced staff, including some well-performing frontline bankers who met their KPIs, yet had to be let go to cut costs. After all, younger less experienced staff are cheaper to retain on the payroll. These displaced mature PMEs above 40 have families and children to support. Many are locals working in foreign banks.",
            "How is Singapore to develop a resilient core of local talent if the first in line to be retrenched are these mature PMEs, ostensibly because the ones at the top making the decision are anxious to protect their own jobs? Have banks adequately considered the additional risk they potentially face by letting go experienced staff?",
            "Even if employers need to lay off workers, I call out to them to do it fairly and responsibly. We have the TAFEP guidelines on Managing Excess Manpower and the Tripartite Code of Good Industrial Relations Practice which are instructive documents and guidelines on how and what to do before a retrenchment is carried out.",
            "What avenues to exhaust before retrenching? Can we re-deploy? Who are to be retrenched? Who are entitled to retrenchment benefits? When should retrenchment exercises be carried out? Amount of retrenchments to be paid to PMEs? How much notice must I give the worker or union? What is good industrial relations practice? What is the industry and market practice? These are questions I hope employers, in particular those non-unionised ones, give serious thought to and to be fair and progressive in their practices.",
            "Many global businesses are creating jobs of the future at a breakneck pace, and we need to ensure that Singaporean employees in the financial sector have the right skills to fill them. If you are ready to work, you should be able to find a job that fits your skills. And if you want to move up within your field into a better job, you should have access to training to get the skills you need. For the financial sector, as many are global companies not based in Singapore, to take on bigger roles, we need to provide the much needed regional and international exposure and not just skills alone.",
            "The Government plays a vital role to minimise job mismatch, skills mismatch and expectation mismatch. We should go back to basics. Many of the curriculums in finance courses in Polytechnics and Universities do not really teach banking. We should link our Pre-Employment Training courses with in depth Continuing Education and Training (CET) programmes so that our talent can be job-ready even before they enter the industry. So, if finance majors intend to build a career in banking, their internships should be coupled with certification programmes whilst attached with banks and learn as they earn. Not just limited to Polytechnic but also for University students and taking certification programmes with financial training institutes which are currently offering CET programmes.",
            "Many of our banking talent, too, have become specialists and not given the opportunity to learn about other areas in banking. They are not encouraged to move through different areas or departments. I believe we should have an adult \"Earn and Learn\" as well. Give our local talent the opportunities to be attached or move across different areas of banking – front office, middle office and back office. And if there are opportunities to take on short-term global projects – do not just give to specialists to be posted for those overseas projects. Let our local talent be given those overseas projects as well and gradually assimilate and progress into the job.",
            "So, with the current letting go of banking talent, can we redeploy the talent displaced to other areas and can they be given \"Earn and Learn\" opportunities as well? They can be sent for accredited programmes whilst being deployed in areas in the bank or other parts of the bank where they can be utilised.",
            "All said, I am glad to share that reflecting the spirit of tripartism and as a key SkillsFuture initiative for the financial sector, we have formed last year and recently officially launched the Financial Sector Tripartite Committee (FSTC) which brings together the industry associations, employers, financial cluster unions/Labour Movement, and Government to work in unison to build a common future by fostering a financial workforce that can meet the changing needs of the industry.",
            "As part of the broader SkillsFuture agenda, it is important to equip financial sector professionals with information and knowledge to continuously upgrade themselves and better align their training efforts with their career development.",
            "We will be embarking on the collaboration with the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) to continually review the IBF Standards and identify new cross-functional competencies needed, such as in data analytics and risk management. Structured progression pathways will also be developed for evolving job segments including Consumer Banking, to encourage continuous learning and upskilling.",
            "The FSTC will also set up a financial sector-specific one-stop career advisory facility in April this year, leveraging on the U PME Centre's operational experiences and infrastructure at NTUC Centre in One Marina Boulevard. This Financial Industry Career Advisory Centre (FiCAC) will provide guidance to those keen to join the financial industry as well as those looking to move to new jobs within the industry.",
            "MAS, ABS, IBF, the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA), U PME Centre and NTUC e2i (Employment & Employability Institute) will provide the expertise and resources to support FiCAC in its work. With the support of ABS and U PME Centre, FiCAC will also organise talks on job opportunities in the financial sector.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, to achieve our desired outcome of building a 3R financial sector workforce, one which is ready, resilient and relevant and become co-creators of SG100 and beyond, we need to remind all that the single and collective effort of our tripartite partners is paramount. I urge our tripartite partners to leverage on each other's strengths, continue to partner closely to drive our collective efforts for the sector and stay ahead of the game through innovation and shared goals.",
            "It requires not just individual responsibility, proactiveness and initiative by our workers and unions but the conviction, commitment and tenacity of employers to develop their human capital and build a strong Singaporean Core; and finally, strong support, promotion and assistance from the Government, so that we stay in the right course of this journey.",
            "As one of the top financial hubs that thrive in the region, it is crucial for the Singapore financial sector workforce to remain relevant, resilient and ready so as to stay ahead of the competition. The financial sector has to ensure that the workforce continues to enhance its competency level, capabilities and professionalism by acquiring work skills in new or developing business areas, or in developing more sophisticated or specialist skill sets. Only then can we effectively stay future-ready to serve markets not just locally, but regionally and globally."

          "content": [
            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Patrick Tay for his suggestions on our financial workforce. As he mentioned, with sluggish growth in the global economy, coupled with on-going implementation of the international regulatory reform measures, we are, indeed, seeing consolidation pressures in financial sectors all over the world.",
            "As I had mentioned just now, Singapore is not spared from these forces and consolidation pressures but the impact on our financial sector has been relatively contained. Even as we see some entrenchments from certain banks, others continue to expand and hire. That is why, as I said, we are still generating, on a net basis, new jobs in the finance sector.",
            "We also see demand for talent in key areas of finance, like Asset and Wealth Management, Insurance, Compliance and Risk Management. Looking ahead, we expect to see continued job creation in the financial sector, although at a more moderated pace than before. Over the medium term, we have several plus points in our favour.",
            "The strong pace of urbanisation in Asian cities will spur significant demand for infrastructure development and financing, as well as insurance. There will be growing affluence in Asia with the rising middle class, leading to increased demand for financial services. And as a key financial centre for the region, Singapore stands to benefit from these longer term trends.",
            "Financial institutions are also increasingly adopting new financial technology, or fintech. Demand is growing for people with competencies in these areas, like cyber security, data analytics, application design and development, as well as network and infrastructure. These are areas which Singaporeans can excel in, and secure potentially good jobs in the financial sector.",
            "In the interim, we understand that the changes taking place are a cause for anxiety among affected financial sector workers, especially the mid-career professionals. This is one reason why we have set up the Financial Sector Tripartite Committee (FSTC) with Mr Patrick Tay as a Co-Chairman, to bring together industry associations, Labour Movement, and Government agencies to foster a workforce that can meet the changing needs of the financial industry.",
            "MAS is working very closely with this tripartite committee, with NTUC and the financial cluster unions to help and support those who are affected. In particular, individuals can approach a new one-stop career advisory facility for guidance relating to skills upgrading, and career opportunities in finance and beyond. We are setting up processes and mechanisms to help those, especially the mid-career professionals who are affected. This advisory facility, known as Financial Industry Career Advisory Centre (FiCAC), will be set up in April this year, starting with a focus on the Banking Sector and it will be extended to Insurance and Asset Management sectors in the near future.",
            "Beyond immediate assistance to those who are affected, we also need to look ahead to the middle term to chart the future skills that are needed for the financial industry and systematically equip Singaporeans with these skills. Mr Patrick Tay had elaborated at length on this; I just want to comment briefly on three areas.",
            "First, as he had suggested, we must get our basics right, and make sure that our education system prepares our young people and our potential entrants to the financial sector well for the financial sector.",
            "Mr Tay mentioned that banking is not taught in Polytechnics and Universities. I did a check – banking is covered in the modules and the curriculum of Polytechnics and Universities, but I agree that the curriculum can be improved. That is why MAS is working with the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to enhance the curriculum of existing banking and finance modules, including having more well-structured internships, at both the Polytechnic and University levels. In particular, our Polytechnic students can look forward to the first Retail Banking Earn and Learn Programme, which will be implemented next year.",
            "Second, we will provide more learning pathways and training opportunities for Singaporean finance professionals at all levels to tap on the SkillsFuture measures and pursue mastery in their respective fields.",
            "MAS is already doing this through various schemes under SkillsFuture. For example, we have the Finance Scholarship Programme (FSP) to support early- and mid-career Singaporeans in developing specialist capabilities. We also recently launched Financial Sector SkillsFuture Study Award which is another channel of financial support to enable individuals to upgrade their skills through a range of programmes.",
            "Looking ahead, we will collaborate with different stakeholders, including the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) and the unions to review and develop additional programmes needed to upskill industry competencies.",
            "Mr Tay had suggested that there may be too many of our banking professionals becoming specialists, or taking on specialist roles. But, in fact, we need many more Singaporean specialists, in areas like risk management, compliance, wealth management and cyber security. We do need more people to go deeper into these specialist areas. We can do various things to nurture them. We can set up new centres of excellence to deepen capabilities and work with employers to develop meaningful career progression for these specialists.",
            "At the same time, while we provide for specialist skills in areas of need, I agree with Mr Tay that we also need to develop professionals with a sufficient breadth of skills to be flexible and resilient in times of change. This means doing several things. We will need to pre-emptively identify the key jobs that are evolving and develop structured training pathways for professionals. We must identify new cross-functional competencies that may be needed for finance professionals, new competencies like data analytics and digital banking; new competencies that will help our professionals to be more resilient in the future. All these will support continual learning pathways under SkillsFuture and facilitate more seamless transitions for professionals across different areas of finance.",
            "Third, we will continue to work closely with the key financial institutions to build a strong core of Singaporean finance professionals and uphold fair employment practices. This is something that I have talked about in this House at the last Committee of Supply debate. And I mentioned that MAS has been engaging the top leadership of key financial institutions in this area of strengthening the Singaporean core in our financial sector workforce and ensuring fair employment practice.",
            "The response that we have received from the top leadership of our key financial institutions – many of whom, incidentally, are Singaporeans as well – has been positive. Many of them are taking proactive steps to strengthen their Singaporean talent base. We want to ensure that there are more Singaporeans taking up leadership positions in our key financial institutions. So, MAS works with our financial institutions, we are supporting programmes for Singaporeans professionals to be nurtured, for example, by enabling them to take up cross-functional roles within the bank or to take up international postings for better exposure.",
            "These are some of the broad areas that I thought I should highlight and comment on. I am sure the tripartite committee co-chaired by Mr Tay will be having more detailed deliberations to see how these plans can be enhanced, and well implemented on the ground. So, perhaps, next time, Mr Tay can respond to his Adjournment Motion with specific recommendations from the tripartite committee on it plans to improve in many of these areas.",
            "In summary, the Government is stepping up its efforts, and Singaporean financial sector workers can look forward to many more new programmes through SkillsFuture. But at the end of the day, a lot of this work comes down to individual mindsets. Everyone must be prepared to do his part.",
            "As Mr Tay had highlighted correctly, the next decade will be both disruptive and transformative for financial institutions. This will have a significant bearing on the scale and nature of financial sector jobs around the world, including in Singapore. In this period of volatility and change, we must all embrace the desire to keep learning and improving ourselves. We must all have a greater sense of urgency towards reskilling, upskilling and acquiring new skills.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, MAS is committed to work with the industry, to work with NTUC and our unions to build a ready, resilient and relevant workforce in the financial sector. Thank you.",

Examples of such crimes include cheating involving e-commerce, credit-for-sex scams and Internet love scams. Police are taking active steps to address this increase. First, Police are stepping up local enforcement efforts. In 2015, Police conducted four island wide enforcement operations targeting online scams and arrested 139 persons. Persons found to be perpetrating an online scam or who knowingly assist foreign syndicates in such criminal activities will be investigated and prosecuted.",
            "Second, Police work closely with their foreign counterparts to foil such syndicates. For example, Police received reports of credit-for-sex scams committed by syndicates operating in China last year. As a result of collaboration between SPF and their Chinese counterparts, the Chinese police conducted simultaneous raids and detained 43 members of one such syndicate.",
            "Third, Police are reviewing our laws to enhance the powers for officers to deal with online crime.",
            "Fourth, Police have stepped up public education programmes, to raise awareness and prevent the public from falling victim to scams. Online crimes are particularly hard to solve because of the borderless nature of the internet. A significant proportion of online commercial crimes are committed remotely by foreign syndicates. Despite our best efforts in going after the perpetrators in such online commercial crimes, they will find new ways to exploit and prey on the vulnerabilities of potential victims, and hide themselves from law enforcement agencies. Awareness and prevention are therefore critical in addressing the rise in such crimes.",
            "SPF and NCPC launched a dedicated anti-scam website, www.scamalert.sg, as a one-stop resource to keep the public abreast of the latest scams and the modus operandi of various scams. The website has attracted more than 170,000 visitors since its launch in November 2014.",
            "Police also reach out to the public at locations with high human traffic, for example, displaying posters at hawker centres, bus stops, and train stations. Crime prevention commercials are also aired on local TV channels and at over 500 office buildings. Police will continually review and improve these public education measures to ensure they stay relevant and effective.",
            "Ultimately however, beyond public education and outreach efforts, it is about how we as individuals and families are aware about the threats on the Internet and how vigilant and alert we are. We have to be cautious when we are online as the stranger on the other side may not be who he says he is, and when the offer sounds too good to be true."

In the past four years, ACRA has investigated 10 business entities for failing to properly state their name and/or registration number.",

Second, companies should peruse carefully all the terms and conditions set out by the third party before entering into any form of agreement.

I propose to provide the data using results of the 2.4 km run and the sit-ups, as these are the two stations that were common to both formats.",
            "Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) have performed better in both these stations after the format was changed. They achieved on average an improvement of 5 sit-ups and ran 16 seconds faster for the 2.4km. Compared to the previous format, the new scoring system encourages NSmen to go all out for each station, to compensate for lower scores in any one station. NSmen can also better focus on their training with fewer stations in the new format. For the push-up station, which is new, NSmen were able to perform above the median number required in each age category. For example, Full-time National Servicemen on average did 49 push-ups, while NSmen aged 34-39 performed an average of 30 push-ups within the minute stipulated. The overall pass rates for all those who took IPPT in the new format varied from 70% to 97%, depending on selected age categories.",
            "The total number of NSmen who received IPPT monetary awards for achieving the standards for Gold, Silver, and Pass with Incentive has also increased. The proportion of NSmen who received Gold and Silver awards increased by 4% to about 30%, and the proportion of NSmen who received Pass with Incentive awards increased by 9% to about 30%. The results of the new IPPT format are therefore very encouraging and indicate that the change has motivated NSmen to train and perform better. The SAF is confident that more NSmen will show improvement in their IPPT as they become familiar with the new format. The SAF will continue to support NSmen through a variety of IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) programmes and the IPT-in-the-Park initiative to make fitness training more convenient, flexible and effective. Better fitness will ensure that NSmen are better prepared for their operational demands."

SCDF has worked with the Ministry of Health and the People's Association to provide CPR and AED training to community responders through the \"Dispatcher Assisted first Responder\" (DARE) programme. To date, about 300 residents have been trained in each of the six pilot constituencies.",

In the event of a cardiac arrest case, SCDF will notify, through the app, Community First Responders in the vicinity to respond. Since its launch in April 2015, the app has been downloaded about 9,000 times. The Community First Responders have been alerted to more than 3,800 cardiac arrest cases.",
            "Apart from our neighbourhoods, SCDF is working with MOH and the Singapore Heart Foundation to encourage more public and private establishments to install AEDs and train their staff. All schools, community centres, sports stadiums, SAF camps and Home Team facilities have already installed AEDs. A recent initiative that SCDF implemented last November was with SMRT and Temasek Cares to install AEDs in 100 SMRT taxis. In the event of a cardiac arrest case, the trained taxi driver can quickly go to the scene to help.",

Schools participating in DSA are committed to develop students to their fullest potential in both their studies and areas of talent, and have put in place a range of programmes and support structures to help DSA students balance academic demands and CCA commitments.",
            "Schools help students who face academic challenges, regardless of whether they entered via DSA or not in two broad ways. Firstly, they make efforts to know these students, their learning styles, their strengths and difficulties and what motivates them. Many schools ensure that their DSA students are assigned teacher mentors and class buddies. There are regular discussion sessions with the DSA students and dialogues with parents to better understand the students’ needs. With this knowledge, schools can then provide targeted academic support, structured guidance and adjust their curriculum and programmes to better cater to them.",
            "Secondly, schools monitor these students closely. Schools track the academic performance of DSA students and have regular platforms to discuss whether and what kind of interventions are necessary.

Vaccinations against measles and diphtheria are compulsory in Singapore. The take up rates for measles and diphtheria vaccinations are high among Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, with coverage in children aged two years maintained at around 95% or higher in the last five years. The high vaccination coverage confers herd immunity and reduces the risk of disease outbreaks. As measles and diphtheria vaccinations are bundled together in the form of combination vaccines with vaccinations on the NCIS for other diseases such as mumps, rubella, whooping cough, polio, and tetanus, herd immunity is achieved for these diseases as well.",
            "MOH has taken an educational approach to encourage parents to comply with vaccinating their children. The National Immunisation Registry under the Health Promotion Board (HPB) tracks pre-school children, and sends letters to remind parents to bring their children for vaccination if they have not done so. HPB’s School Health Service actively follows up on unvaccinated children in primary schools. This has worked well and resulted in high levels of vaccination coverage among our children.",

In the last three years, while there were reports of adverse reactions suspected to be associated with vaccines, majority of the reports relate to known adverse reactions, such as injection-site swelling or pain, fever and febrile fits.",

About half of those who opted out were younger members aged 30 and below, and may have done so because they did not have dependants.

This is because the member’s children are more likely to have attained financial independence and the member would have accumulated more savings to support his dependants in the event of his untimely demise or incapacitation. Extending DPS coverage beyond age 60 will provide longer insurance protection but will also mean much higher premiums because of higher mortality. We will review the DPS age limit periodically, bearing in mind the need to strike a balance between providing insurance protection for the CPF members' dependants and preserving their CPF savings for their own retirement needs.

Since 2014, 140 companies have applied for ODP support for the employment of persons with disabilities. The average claim per company is $3,000.",
            "Besides the ODP, there are other initiatives to promote the employment of persons with disabilities. For example, SG Enable works with Voluntary Welfare Organisation partners to provide job placement and support services for persons with disabilities. Collectively, they have placed about 650 persons with disabilities in employment over the past two years, some with the support of the ODP."

          "content": [
            ": MND has completed its study on reverse mortgages for HDB flats. A reverse mortgage is a loan taken up by a property owner using his property as collateral. However, unlike a conventional mortgage, the borrower does not need to make cash repayment during the loan tenure. He only needs to repay the loan with accumulated interest upon loan termination or death, typically from the sales proceeds of his property. A reverse mortgage thus allows the property owner to unlock some equity while retaining the financial upside from any appreciation in property value.",
            "A reverse mortgage is a complex financial product with inherent risks. First, as it does not require periodic cash repayments, the loan balance grows with interest. Second, the flat owner has to bear property risks. If the market value of the property becomes less than the outstanding loan, the owners may have to sell the property prematurely to repay the loan, resulting in them having to look for alternative accommodation at an old age.",
            "We note that NTUC Income offered reverse mortgage for HDB flats in 2006. As only 24 households signed up, NTUC Income has since stopped offering the product. The take-up overseas is also not high.",
            "There are various other monetisation options for HDB flat owners today, such as the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS). The LBS is an equity sale scheme where flat owners sell the tail-end lease of their flat to HDB and retain a shorter lease. This enables elderly households to receive a lifelong stream of income to supplement their retirement income. As compared to reverse mortgage, while LBS owners cannot sell their flat in the open market, they do not face any property equity risks. We recently enhanced the LBS in April 2015, and this was well received.",
            "Besides LBS, elderly flat owners may take up the Silver Housing Bonus if they right-size to a 3-room or smaller flat. They also have other options of subletting either a bedroom or the entire flat, and staying with their family members.",
            "Thus, MND has no plans to introduce reverse mortgage for HDB flats for now. MND will continue to regularly review and adjust our various schemes to meet the needs of our elderly."
