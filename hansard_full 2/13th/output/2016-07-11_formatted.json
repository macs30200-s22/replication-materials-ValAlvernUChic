          "content": [
            ": Mdm Speaker, the insurance requirements imposed on taxis and private hire cars are the same. The Motor Vehicles Act requires all motor vehicles, including taxis and private hire cars, to be insured against third-party liability risks, which include death or bodily injury to passengers. Specifically, this means that passengers in a private hire car that is involved in a motor accident can claim compensation from the owner of the private hire car or its insurer. Both taxis and private hire cars are required to procure insurance which covers the use of the vehicles for hire and reward purposes.",
            "The inspection requirements for private hire cars are the same as those for private motorcars, while taxis have to go for more frequent inspections. This is because LTA's data shows that on average, currently, taxis run about 145,000 km annually, about five times the annual mileage of private hire cars. LTA will review the data regularly to see if there is a need to adjust the inspection frequency for private hire cars.",
            "After the upcoming revamp, the taxi driving course will be shortened to about 25 hours, whereas the chauffeured services course will be about 10 hours long. The difference in training hours is mainly because taxi drivers can pick up street hail jobs, while private hire car drivers are not allowed to do so. Street hail jobs comprise 80% of all taxi trips, and the additional navigational and route planning components of the taxi driving course train taxi drivers for this. Taxi drivers must also be able to use a taxi meter correctly, and be familiar with the various regulations concerning fare collection.",
            "As announced during the Ministry of Transport's Committee of Supply debate recently, there will be no minimum age requirement for private hire car drivers. However, they must have held a driving licence for at least two years. The maximum age for private hire car drivers will be 75 years, like for taxi drivers.",
            "Today, traditional limousine companies and car rental companies employ Permanent Residents and work pass holders as drivers. Work pass holders are subject to work pass conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower. They provide chauffeured services that can be chartered for trips like airport transfers and ferrying of VIPs at events. In order to not disrupt traditional limousine companies and car rental companies when the new regulatory regime is implemented, these Permanent Residents and work pass holders will also be able to apply for the Private Hire Car Driver Vocational Licence. However, Permanent Residents and work pass holders can only provide chauffeured services in the course of their employment under these car rental or limousine companies. This is unlike for Singaporeans, who can be Uber or GrabCar drivers as long as they are sole proprietors of a chauffeured services company. As we understand it, there are no work pass holders driving for Uber or Grab today."

            ": I thank the Speaker and the Minister for the comprehensive answers. I have three supplementary questions. I have residents who are taxi-drivers, and their feedback is that they hope to see a more level playing field. To get the vocational driving licence, they have a certain minimum number of hours that they need to drive and clock in. They think that with these Uber drivers and GrabCar, the playing field is not levelled.",
            "Secondly, from the commuters' point of view, with Uber and GrabCar, the overall service given to the commuters should improve. I would like to ask the Minister are there any statistics, feedback and measurement to show that Uber and GrabCar bring positive impact to our commuters. If not, why should we have that in Singapore that creates so much unhappiness amongst the taxi drivers?",
            "Finally, the Minister mentioned earlier that there is no minimum age for Uber drivers. I would like to ask why is it so. For the safety of the commuters, why can we not specify that there is a minimum age for the Uber drivers?"

          "content": [
            ": I thank the Member for the questions. With regards to a level-playing field, I will break down the answer in two components. First of all, the level-playing field, in terms of the licensing requirements and so on, is in accordance to the current practice. In terms of the need for a Taxi Vocational Licence or a Private Hire Car Driver's Licence (PDVL), there are different conditions. We follow industry practices as best as possible.",
            "When it comes to the impact on the taxi drivers and commuters, these were the stipulated principles of how we address the private-hire car industry. For most, it is commuters' interest; thereafter, the welfare of taxi drivers and private hire car drivers; and the third principle was to allow a transition for the companies given this disruptive technology in Singapore.",
            "If we really want to level the field completely, there are two major issues that may not bear the outcomes that we desire. Today, 80% of taxi trips are by street hail. If you completely level the playing field, it means that the private hire cars will have street hail privileges as well. This will not bring necessarily the outcomes, as desired, if it is a complete level playing field. So, in terms of welfare, transition for the taxi drivers, impact on income, we do not want these to be disrupted overnight. For commuters' interest, if you completely level the playing field and chauffeured service companies and taxi companies become homogenous, then, we will not be able to have the innovative disruption that private hire cars bring to the industry.",
            "In the morning peak hours, when we have an inadequate supply of taxi drivers, many of the commuters' interests are served because there is a supplementary group of drivers that come in the form of Uber and Grab. They are mostly part-time drivers.",
            "On the age limit, we think that safety is better ensured based on an estimate of how good a person is as a driver. So, we think that the requirement for at least two years of driving experience is adequate and we will continue to monitor the situation.",
            "As to the age limit of taxi drivers being set at 30, it was for a different set of reasons. We are open to reviewing this if the taxi industry is requesting for minimum age requirements instead."

            "A follow-up question for the Minister. Let me declare my interest as the advisor for the National Taxi Association. Taking a step back, is it better that we have three categories of drivers, keeping the traditional limo drivers as a separate licence group, the taxi drivers as the first original group and then, create a licence group for the private hire drivers from limo and Grab. Right now, to simplify matters, we have added the traditional limo group into the Uber and Grab group, and therefore, you would require even the traditional group that had been driving without this requirement and new creation, to comply with all the rules. I thought the Ministry could take one step back and see that there are three categories of licences, so that the rules for Uber and Grab drivers become specific to their requirements and vocation, rather than have them mixed up."

            ": Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the question. This was considered in our initial design of the system. It is possible, but at the moment, we think that two categories would be in better service of the three principles I have articulated. Breaking them up into different parts would mean limo drivers versus private hire car drivers; you will have too many categories. Many of the limo drivers that I meet at our discussions are also part-time Uber or Grab drivers. Like how we designed the Taxi Driver Vocational Licence versus the PDVL, we allow cross licensing. This is part of the review to make it not too cumbersome with too many regulations, and for the drivers to not need to jump through too many hoops.",

Our tolls at the Causeway and the Second Link were introduced in 1998, only in response to Malaysia's decision to levy tolls at both crossings. This long-standing policy of matching Malaysia's tolls is to ensure that Malaysia takes into consideration our response whenever they have plans to raise their tolls. If Malaysia removes their tolls, we will do likewise. In other words, our preference has always been a toll-free Causeway and Second Link.",

            ": I understand and share the concerns raised by Members over the safety of our lift operations. Lifts are an integral part of our urbanised, high-rise living environment. Currently, we have around 59,000 passenger lifts, with 24,000 of these in public housing estates, all of which are used with high-frequency on a daily basis. Lifts in Singapore are checked regularly and safe to operate. But like any other machinery, they can malfunction from time to time. Data from the Tele-Monitoring System (TMS), which provides real-time monitoring of HDB lifts, indicate that there were around 20 breakdowns per 1,000 lifts every month in 2015, and in the first half of this year. This is lower than the average breakdown rate of 30 per 1,000 lifts each month registered in the previous two years, in 2013 and 2014. This is just to reiterate. There are perceptions that there had been a sudden surge in lift breakdowns.",
            "This is actual data from Tele-Monitoring System (TMS), which all the Town Councils have. This is real-time monitoring data of HDB lifts operating in their respective estates. We have compiled the data and the breakdown rates were: 30 per 1,000 lifts in 2013 and 2014, on average. And it has come down to 20 per 1,000 lifts per month in 2015, and in the first half of this year.",
            "Nevertheless, despite the rates coming down, any serious lift incident is one too many, and furthermore, as our lifts get older and are subject to more wear and tear, they will face higher risks of faults.",
            "This is why BCA, as the regulatory authority for lifts in Singapore, has been focusing on this issue for some time, and it has been engaging the industry, consulting lift experts, and studying international best practices and standards with the aim of enhancing the regulatory and safety regime for lifts. So, let me share some of the key thrusts in our strategy and in the process, also respond to the queries raised by Members.",
            "Our first priority is to raise our standards of lift maintenance. Currently, all lift owners, including Town Councils, have to engage a registered lift contractor to service the lifts at least once a month. The lift contractors must also carry out an annual inspection and testing of the lifts, in the presence of an independent Authorised Examiner, who has to certify that such inspection and testing was done in accordance with regulatory standards, and that the lifts are fit for operations. This is the regime today.",
            "While these monthly and annual checks are being carried out today, BCA's audits reveal that the quality of work can be improved. This is why BCA has recently announced measures to tighten maintenance standards for lifts. BCA will also step up its audit checks to ensure that lift contractors achieve the required standards, and to take enforcement action against non-compliance. The measures will be implemented this month.",
            "Second, besides tighter regulatory requirements, it is also important for lift companies to build up their capabilities and have competent technicians and engineers doing the work. BCA is therefore working with the industry to set clearer requirements on the scope and level of training for all lift personnel. It is also developing a sectoral plan which will take into account the manpower demand in relevant fields of expertise, as well as the need for better defined career development pathways to attract and retain more skilled professionals in this sector.",
            "Third, we should continue to effectively harness competitive forces in the industry to bring about benefits to residents. There are around eight main lift contractors that maintain about 70% of the lifts in Singapore, as well as many other smaller firms operating in the sector. So, there are many firms but eight larger ones that maintain about 70% of the lifts in Singapore.",
            "All of these lift companies, big or small, are free to bid for the installation of lifts in our public housing estates. HDB adopts a stringent procurement process which takes into account not just cost, but also the quality and reliability of lifts. For new lifts installed in BTO projects and under the Lift Upgrading Programme, HDB imposes the requirement of not more than one lift breakdown per month per 10 lifts installed during the one-year Defects Liability Period (DLP). Lift companies that fail to meet this performance standard will be penalised, for example, through the imposition of liquidated damages, or debarments for future HDB tenders.",
            "Beyond this one-year DLP, Town Councils can decide whether to continue with the Original Equipment Manufacturer or switch to a third-party lift contractor. In this regard, Mr Ang Wei Neng suggested that we facilitate the use of common parts for lifts so that Town Councils will have more contractor options to choose from. I agree with him and I would like to share that the Competition Commission is looking into this very matter, to ensure that third-party lift maintenance contractors have access to essential lift spare parts. So, this will promote more effective competition, and will enable the Town Councils to choose the best contractor to do the job.",
            "Fourth, besides regulatory action by BCA, it is also important for Town Councils, as lift owners, to take responsibility and carry out pro-active maintenance and cyclical replacement of lifts. For example, Town Councils can analyse the lift fault data from the TMS and the records of residents' feedback to identify lifts in their estates which may require more attention. Town Councils should also have qualified personnel within their management teams who can supervise the contractors and work with them to put in place an effective maintenance regime.",
            "A more comprehensive lift maintenance and replacement programme will cost more. For example, with more rigorous checks over time, Town Councils are likely to draw more on their Sinking Funds to replace worn out lift parts or to carry out a complete replacement of older lifts. Town Councils must project and plan ahead, and ensure sufficient savings for long-term financial sustainability, and that is why MND intends to require all Town Councils to set aside a higher proportion of their S&CC collections into their Sinking Funds and to ring-fence a part of the Sinking Fund specifically for lift replacement.",
            "Finally, Mr Pritam Singh asked about Government assistance and Mr Alex Yam also requested for an upgrading programme to replace older lifts. As I had explained in this House earlier, HDB is already implementing the Selective Lift Replacement Programme (SLRP) to replace selected old lifts with new ones that come with better safety and security features on a cost-sharing basis with the Town Councils. The SLRP is a once-off programme and we do not have plans to extend it further. The replacement of old lifts is the responsibility of the Town Councils and ought to be undertaken by them as part of their cyclical maintenance programme.",
            "However, for the existing lifts that are not due for replacement soon, we will look at the possibility of helping the Town Councils to retrofit them with key safety enhancements and features. So, I am not talking about lifts that are due for replacement because these are old lifts that should be replaced by the Town Councils; but about the ones that are not due for replacement soon, MND will look at the possibility of helping Town Councils retrofit them with key safety enhancements and features. This support for safety enhancements for existing lifts will require significant Government expenditure, so we are studying the matter carefully and will announce the details when ready.",
            "To sum up, all of us, be it the Government, regulator, lift owners, contractors, or even lift users, have a part to play to ensure that our lifts are reliable and safe. Over the years, we have put in place an effective operating and regulatory regime for lifts in Singapore. Let us work together to make it even better and safer for everyone."

            "The second question is: with the breakdowns that we have seen in the last few months, is there a need to review the procurement policies?",
            "For example, whether the current contractual tenures for these lift maintenance contractors are too short for them to the extent that they may not want to invest in lift maintenance capabilities because they are not sure whether they will still be in business after two years. So, would we want to look into the tenure, as well as how they source the parts? There are still talks that maybe the parts that we sourced from a cheaper place, may compromise the quality.

Twenty per 1,000 is still, I think, a figure that we should try to bring down even further. That can only be done if we all work together, as I said. There will not be a magic solution, but that can only be done if we tighten up across the board – procurement, maintenance and timely replacement.",
            "So I agree with the Member on his subsequent point that we should look at procurement standards as well, and we are. As I mentioned, we will look at making sure that our standards are tight, that we procure not just looking at cost, but also looking at quality, which includes looking at the source, the origins of where the various lift parts are made, as the Member had suggested.",
            "On his suggestion about making sure there is a longer Defects Liability Period (DLP), meaning to say after procuring and installing the lifts, would we want the contractor to have a requirement to maintain the lift for a longer period beyond the one-year DLP, which is in place today?",
            "We will look at it and we potentially can consider a longer DLP. It may mean a bit of a higher cost, but it also means that the Town Council is locked in to the OEM for a longer period of time and you would not have the flexibility to allow competition to come in and to switch between different contractors. So, we have to find the balance, but we are prepared to consider a longer DLP."

            ": I thank the Minister for his earlier reply. Just three supplementary questions. The first with regard to my original question, the Minister has shared that part of the finding is that maintenance can be improved, but beyond that, were there any other findings from BCA's independent audit since March?",
            "The second is: in November 2005, the Commissioner of Buildings did away with the requirement for the display of the Certificate of Lift Maintenance and Testing by the authorised examiners. But last Friday, the Commissioner has now issued new instructions to say that a new permit to operate the system will be undertaken by BCA and this certification will be required to be displayed and renewed annually. Could I understand a little bit more about what was the reason for BCA reviewing this requirement for display, and what role BCA will be taking, beyond just providing the issuance of the certificate?",
            "Lastly, I think this is also an issue that many fellow Members have raised in their questions: with the more stringent inspection regime and possibly a lot more servicing required, is BCA aware of the manpower situation in the lift maintenance and lift manufacturing industry and whether we will be facing issues with lack of manpower in the short term?"

            ": Madam, let me address the three questions in turn. First of all, on the findings of BCA's audits, I would say that across the various audits and also the investigation of incident that have happened so far, BCA has not found any systematic trend, or identifiable trends across the various incidents. Each one is quite unique, it varies across different lift models and different ages. Generally, if you look at data, like from the TMS and if you look at the overall state of lifts today, we can say that older lifts tend to have a higher breakdown rate. In particular, older lifts beyond 20 years. If you were to take a more preventive or risk-based approach, I would say, step up the maintenance and have preventive checks for the older lifts, particularly the ones which are above 20 years. That is common sense because these are lifts which have been subject to more wear and tear, and therefore, they need better maintenance.",
            "On the Certificate of Lifts, the Member mentioned that it was taken away previously but even though there was not a requirement to display, the certificates continued to be lodged with BCA. So, there was still that process. The decision now to require it to be displayed is really part of the broader review to see how we can tighten standards and ensure accountability. We want to make sure that it is not just about the certificate and the display of it, but to make sure that proper checks are done before the lifts are allowed to operate. Once that permit to operate is issued, it will be displayed together with the Authorised Examiner's name, so that there is accountability – the person who did the checks, the name is there, is displayed. Potentially, even the lift contractor's name will be put up together with the certificate. This is the second point.",
            "Third point on manpower requirements, we are mindful that this may require more people in the industry, in the immediate term. In longer term, we will, as I said, look at sectoral plans to develop and ensure a healthy pipeline of technicians and engineers in this sector. In the immediate term, we are still in discussion with all the lift contractors. BCA is engaging them to identify specifically whether there are immediate manpower needs and how best to help them address these manpower needs. So, we are engaging the industry closely."

            ": Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would just like to ask the Minister specifically with regard to lifts which are above 20 years of age ‒ which the Minister has acknowledged ‒ tend to have more maintenance-related issues. I think the point of balance for Town Councils would be to enhance contracts and by doing so, require more regular lift maintenance. That would mean increasing routine expenditure for the Town Council. This would have to be balanced against making a decision to replace the lifts or to upgrade the lifts earlier. That would, of course, entail the use of sinking funds. So, that is the real issue for many Town Councils, I believe.",
            "And in that light, with regard to the safety enhancements that Minister has spoken about that HDB are looking at, and because it may cause a large sum of money, does the Minister have any estimate of when HDB will come to that decision? Town Councils will have to start determining how to project their finances going forward."

And so, we are doing a study right now and we will be informing Town Councils in due course, what we intend to do for the safety enhancements and what vintage of lifts. Obviously, it would not make sense for us to spend a lot of money on safety enhancements on a lift that is already going to be due for replacement next year. Because the better thing to do, as Mr Singh has suggested, is for the Town Councils to replace these very old lifts. So, these safety enhancements would be done, as I have mentioned, in my answer earlier, for lifts that are not due for replacement soon. Exactly what age, we will have to study and this will take time to implement as well because we are talking about a huge stock of existing lifts which we will have to do progressively over a few years. But I know that Town Councils need the data and the information to plan and we will strive to provide this information as soon as possible."

            ": Madam, I thank the Member for clarifying this point. As far as I am aware from BCA's checks with the industry, there is no such 15-year guideline in placed across the board, certainly, for private sector lifts in Singapore or anywhere in the world, for that matter. So, that is from what we have gathered so far. In fact, if you look around the world, too, at lift replacement, it is a wide range. There are lifts in other countries that have been operating for more than 30, 40, 50 years and still continuing to operate.",
            "So, the point about the replacement period, it is simply a guideline. It cannot be prescriptive because these are machines that and the replacement guide will depend on your usage frequency, will depend on your standard of maintenance over the years. Obviously, if it is well maintained, it may even go beyond 28 years, but it is a lift that has not been well maintained in the past, then you may want to replace it even earlier. Or for that matter, you may want to replace most of the parts before 28 years is up.",
            "Replacement really has to be done on a case by case basis. I do not think we can generalise. Town Councils will therefore have to work with their lift contractors, looking at each particular lift, the model, the age, the history of maintenance, and then make a decision consciously, whether to do early replacement or maybe to change some of the major parts or to allow the lift to continue with a good maintenance regime.",
            "On the earlier points that the Member has suggested, certification, we are going to tighten up. As I said, we are looking at clearer guidelines and training requirements for all lift personnel, including the technicians. We are doing that. On the second point about new lifts, and the liquidated damages, I would say, we are aware that for new lifts, there is generally also a higher breakdown rate or a fault rate, reported fault rate in the first year. And this is across a board, particularly because of teething issues or maybe sometimes it is related to residents moving in, renovation contractors, and all sorts of things ̶ user habits. So, this tends to be the case, then it will be stabilised. The lift fault rate tends to stabilise after the first year. And then, as I said, with wear and tear, you start to see older lifts having higher fault rates as well. But first year, it is really a teething issue.",
            "So long as it is within the DLP, HDB will work with the lift contractor to make sure that any of these teething issues, with your new lifts and your new BTO flats are resolved expediently and resolved as soon as possible. If indeed, the contractor is the one who is responsible, then this will be taken into account the next time the contractor submits her bid for a future HDB lift contract, and HDB will look at its past records and consider it very carefully before awarding it any future tenders. So, on that score, you do not have to worry that you will have a recalcitrant contractor bidding for another future contract. I would say that most contractors that we have dealt with for these new lifts have been very responsive and they have come forward to make sure that whatever the complaints are for the new lifts, their issues are resolved as soon as possible."

It is a rich database that allows Town Councils to already do data analytics to understand better; which are the lifts with higher fault rates and for those with higher fault rates, to go in, understand the reasons why this is happening and if need be, take corrective actions, take remedial actions. There can be various reasons. We have found out, for example, in some instances is due to the newspaper vendor coming in every morning and jamming the lift doors when they deliver newspapers.",

In cases and conversations, we also often hear from employees or job-seekers on how employers tend to favour or discriminate against certain race profiles, and so forth.

Firstly, the Minister of State referred to a survey of companies in relation to non-discriminatory and fair employment practices. Does the Ministry intend to conduct a survey of employees and job applicants, because surely that would be a more accurate way of determining if there are really discriminatory practices that are prevalent, rather than asking the employers but also regularly survey the employees? That is the first question.",
            "The second question is on the enforcement powers. Does the Government feel that there are sufficient enforcement powers because if an employer is recalcitrant in the face of a warning, the Minister of State mentioned that the Ministry can curtail the Work Pass or threaten to curtail the Work Pass, but what about companies that do not depend on Work Passes, which have an entirely domestic workforce? That threat may not be useful to get them to comply. Is the Ministry satisfied that the current enforcement powers are sufficient to deal with such cases? Even if such cases have not occurred now, they may occur in the future."

            "As for whether there is enough enforcement that is effective, if you look at the numbers so far, there are about 400 complaints of all sorts of discrimination, not just race and religion. Race and religion is about 10%. Between 2011 and 2015, on average, it made up about 400 for all the complaints. In 2015, that year itself, which is the latest survey, about 300. So, the numbers remain stable in terms of discrimination complaints of all sorts, which is, maybe, say, six areas, and a very small minority, about 10%, is race and religion issue.",
            "We feel that with this stability – not that we can eliminate all the discrimination – the current practice or multi-pronged approach in terms of imposing the penalties or curtailing Work Passes, as well as TAFEP's counselling and advisory work with the companies and following up closely with the companies, have been effective. Especially when we look at the outcome, all the companies heeded the advice and there were no repeated case. We will continue to monitor closely whether of such needs to increase the enforcement. As of now, we feel that the current multi-pronged practice has been effective."

The unhappy part about it is the $1,100 monthly household income cut-off criterion, per person is too low to qualify for the Blue card. I would like to ask whether the Ministry would look at reviewing this threshold, given that medical expenses have gone up and whether there is any plan to merge the Blue and Orange cards. Given that the Orange card is so unpopular and not so appreciated, maybe we should just have more of the Blue card. That will also take some of the patient load off the polyclinics because there are still a lot of people going to the polyclinics as it is a lot cheaper. If we can expand this group, that is, to have more getting the Blue card, that would probably improve the well-being of everyone and also ease the workload in the polyclinics."

We review these guidelines from time to time to ensure they remain in line with our objectives.

While there have been some complaints alleging high fees or suspected over-charging, so far, we have not found any clear evidence of over-charging in these cases. Given the considerable variation in GP practices and the autonomy of GPs to determine their charges, cases of overcharging can sometimes be very difficult to define. Furthermore, like I mentioned in my reply, there are many factors that can result in the variation of the bill sizes, and these include the patient's condition, how long the consultation is, the type of treatment, the type of medication, and the complexity of the medical conditions. All these will be taken into consideration during our investigation on some of the feedback from patients.",

However, if we compare this to the large number of CHAS claims, we have received a relatively small number of such concerns, although many of us do hear from some of our residents.

We advised travellers who have returned to Singapore from affected areas to monitor their health and consult a doctor if they have symptoms of Zika, such as fever, skin rashes, joint and muscle pains, headaches and red eyes. MOH also informed hospitals and doctors about the notification, testing and clinical management for suspected Zika cases.",
            "In addition, MOH advised pregnant women to postpone non-essential travel to countries with ongoing Zika outbreaks. If they have to travel to these areas, they should take strict precautions to protect themselves against mosquito bites.",
            "As part of our on-going efforts to prevent and manage infectious disease outbreaks, MOH works closely with other government agencies such as MHA, ICA, and CAAS as part of the Homefront Crisis Management System. This approach has been effective in dealing with previous global outbreaks, such as the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the 2015 MERS outbreak in the Middle East and Republic of Korea."

With the Rio Olympics next month, we are a bit concerned whether the Zika virus will be brought back to the region by those who are participating in the Olympics or just going to attend the Olympics. What control measures do we now have to protect our athletes as well as to make sure that when they come back, whether they will be screened to see if they have the Zika virus. My concern is that we do have the vector here. Once the Zika virus sets root in Singapore, it is very hard to get rid of it.",

With the Rio Olympics, because Brazil is one of the affected countries, there will be people who will be travelling to Brazil and then, subsequently, travelling to Singapore. This is not confined to our athletes. It is also people who attend the Olympics in Brazil. With regard to our athletes, we have been in touch with the Singapore National Olympics Council and Sports Singapore to provide advisories to our athletes and officials. For example, when they are in Brazil, to protect themselves against mosquito bites, they should be wearing clothing that will cover the body, the arms and legs. They should apply insect repellent and also take precautions to sleep in air-conditioned rooms or under the mosquito nets to keep out the mosquitoes. And, very importantly, also to monitor for symptoms. I have mentioned earlier fever, rash, muscle ache, red eyes and headache. This should be done while they are in Brazil but also 14 days after they leave the country. These advisories that we provide are not just for the athletes and officials but all travellers who are visiting countries experiencing Zika outbreaks.",
            "The second question that the Member asked is with regards to regional cooperation and, indeed, whether it is a Zika infection or any other outbreaks, because of the global nature of the spread of such diseases, it is essential for us to work closely with WHO and also with our regional counterparts. Zika, for example, is already found in our neighbouring countries and we have to take steps to work together to monitor and also to coordinate our responses."

            ": And congratulations, Madam, on your recent elevation. Mdm Speaker, the cyber security threat level is significant and shows no sign of abating. In May 2015, I informed Parliament that the Government had detected a security breach in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) IT system. Immediate steps were taken to remove the threat and to remediate affected systems. Since then, there have been more targeted cyber-attacks on Government networks. While these attacks were successfully contained, we can expect more to follow. Cyber security firms such as Mandiant and Microsoft Research have published reports explaining in detail how such attacks are carried out. It is clear from these reports that the attackers rely on the Internet to introduce malware into a network, to send instructions to infected machines, to infect more machines within a network, and finally to steal data from the network.",
            "IDA studied this issue together with the agencies for several years. When we spoke to other Governments, some indicated that they set up isolated networks, whilst some have explored limiting Internet access only to the necessary functions. Due to security reasons, these measures are generally not publicised. Many options were deliberated. In the meantime, agencies assessed to be at higher risk, such as MTI and MFA, went ahead with separating Internet surfing. But agency-level arrangements do not make the whole Government network safer, because an attacker can still enter the network via another agency which continues to allow Internet surfing when connected to the Government network. Madam, IDA's decision may not be popular, but it is ultimately the right decision. The Government has a duty to do all it can to protect the data it possesses, especially since such data often contains personal information of our citizens.",
            "Separating Internet surfing will make it much more difficult for an attacker to succeed in its various stages of attack. It will mean that public officers have to make some changes. They will now have to access the Internet via a different device, rather than from a single device. The device that they use for Internet surfing must only be used for unclassified work. But the key point, Madam, is that they can still surf the Internet for work, using either separate devices provided by their organisation, or their own mobile devices.",
            "Madam, there will be no change for the public. They will still be able to send and receive e-mails from Government officers. Government e-Services and transactions by the public and businesses will not be affected.",
            "There is no reason to believe that the effectiveness of agencies will be adversely affected. Agencies like MTI and MFA have already implemented the separation of Internet surfing for some years, while MINDEF has implemented even more stringent requirements. These organisations have not become less effective as a result.",
            "Madam, Dr Daniel Goh asked how the Government can help local enterprises protect against cyber threats. The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) has been working closely with industry associations to promote the importance of cyber security. It has organised conferences with the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) on cyber security. The Government worked with SBF to develop an Employee Cyber Security Kit. This free toolkit features a simple quiz which provides an initial assessment of a company's cyber security readiness and follows up with a recommended cyber security education programme tailored to meet business needs. There have been over 3,000 downloads of the resources and tools. CSA and the Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation co-chair a Cyber Security Awareness Alliance, which does good work in increasing awareness and adoption of cyber security practices. So, help is available to our businesses who want to do something to improve their cyber security.",
            "Madam, far from affecting the Smart Nation initiative or our reputation, a strong cyber security provides a strong and sure foundation for building a Smart Nation. In fact, other countries have expressed interest in learning from our experience. We cannot be a Smart Nation that is trusted and resilient, if our systems are exposed and vulnerable."

I am not at liberty to discuss today in Parliament what solutions we explored because we have a whole range of efforts that you can put in. Clearly, putting in enough anti-viruses into our system is not sufficient because the experts will tell you it can only stop about, maybe, 20% to 30% of the malware. We deliberated this for a very, very long time and we decided that the best way is really to do an Internet separation. We have to balance this against costs and usability, and given the fact the Internet facing is always a challenge for us, we thought it was better to have a separate system all together.",
            "Allowing, of course, public officers to still surf the Internet on different devices. So, for example, the Prime Minister and some Ministers have already gone on with the separation. I have a separate laptop altogether – it allows me to surf the Internet. So far, it has not affected our work.",
            "On the issue of productivity, I think this is something which we will continue to monitor. Certainly, we do not want to affect the work of our public officers. As I mentioned in my reply, we have given ourselves one year. There is a whole of series of workshops that we are conducting with senior management right down to the IT division within each of the Ministry for them to work together and find the best way forward. I think we recognise that there may be some instances where separation may not be possible now because of the nature of the work. So, we will leave this to the agencies to work with IDA to determine exactly how we are going to proceed. But as a policy, the Government has adopted this as the best way forward for us to ensure that we do not have any more attacks.",
            "At the same time, you and I know – I cannot promise there will be no more attacks because the hackers are becoming more sophisticated, new hacking tools are being developed and it is always very difficult for us to keep ahead. So, we think this is the best approach going forward. But like all governments, we will never close other options. We will continue to explore what are the available options out there and see whether we will review our strategies down the road."

            ": Madam, I am taking this question on behalf of Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam who is also Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). As Singapore's financial centre grows in scale and sophistication, we have to be vigilant against the risk of its abuse for illicit financing activities. Indeed, all international financial and business centres face the risk of being used as a conduit for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. Singapore has taken this risk very seriously, and we have in recent years significantly enhanced our regime for tackling money laundering and illicit financing risks.",
            "Our regime against money laundering comprises four key elements: strict regulations, rigorous supervision, effective enforcement, and good cross-border cooperation.",
            "Financial institutions are the critical gatekeepers against the flow of illicit funds. So, we require financial institutions to comply with strict anti-money laundering regulations, and to have in place robust controls to detect and deter illicit activities. More recent measures taken to strengthen our regime include criminalising the laundering of serious tax offences; enhancing MAS' Notices and Guidelines in line with evolving international standards; and stepping up our inspections of financial institutions.",
            "MAS will not hesitate to take firm actions against financial institutions whose anti-money laundering controls are found to be lacking. As Mr Ong has highlighted, MAS decided to withdraw the merchant bank status of BSI Bank for recurrent and serious breaches of anti-money laundering control requirements, and MAS has also referred six members of the bank's senior management and staff to the Public Prosecutor. Our regulatory and law enforcement agencies also share information and cooperate closely with their foreign counterparts.",
            "We are also making organisational changes so as to enhance MAS' supervisory focus and effectiveness at a time of increasing sophistication of illegal money flows globally. So MAS will consolidate supervisory responsibilities relating to money laundering and other illicit financing risks in a dedicated department. MAS will also have a new enforcement department that will work closely with the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) to investigate money laundering and other financial market offences."

But the reality is that these new requirements are imposed across the board. These are new international standards that all financial institutions are complying with. So it does increase compliance cost but it is being done across the board and is applied on all financial institutions be it in Singapore or internationally. So, I think this is an increased cost but it is a cost that financial institutions would have to bear in order to be more effective in the global fight against money laundering and against terrorism financing."

MAS also monitors the prevailing cyber threat landscape and issues targeted advisories to FIs.",

In addition to investments at the individual FI level, they are also collaborating on industry initiatives to strengthen the sector's cyber resilience. The Association of Banks in Singapore Standing Committee on Cyber Security (SCCS) was set up in 2013, and has since served as a useful platform for industry collaboration. Since inception, the SCCS has championed a number of initiatives to raise industry standards, for example, in the area of penetration testing. They have also commenced regular sector-level cyber exercises amongst its members to test the FIs' responses and operating procedures against various cyber threat scenarios. The group also meets regularly to exchange insights and intelligence on cyber threats.",

            "Following the Brexit vote, as Members know, the British Pound has declined sharply in value, and the US Dollar and the Yen have strengthened in global markets. Other Asian currencies, including the Singapore Dollar also weakened against the US Dollar, as is typical when there is a sudden increase in risks in global markets. The resulting movement of the Singapore Dollar on a trade-weighted basis has been orderly and contained. Stock markets also fell immediately after the Referendum, and have since recovered.",
            "We can expect repeated bouts of volatility in financial markets as Brexit is debated and negotiated. But what is of greater concern are the economic and political uncertainties resulting from Brexit. These uncertainties will weigh on the UK, Europe and the global economy for at least a few years, and are likely to dampen growth.",
            "The first uncertainty has to do with what Brexit actually means. There is no clarity within the UK, even among proponents of Brexit, on the nature of its future relationship with the EU. This state of affairs may persist for some time. It is also not clear when the UK will formally trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which serves formal notice to leave the EU.",
            "Second, even after formal notice is served, negotiations between the UK and EU are likely to be complex and prolonged. The basic conundrum is that the UK wants free access to the EU market but control over immigration from the EU, whereas the EU sees free access to its market and free movement of people as one package. That is the basic conundrum. Both UK and EU leaders will be mindful of their domestic political circumstances, and the EU will want to ensure that more member states are not encouraged to follow the UK.",
            "In short, there is no precedent for Brexit, and no one can say how and when events will unfold. Until the future trade and investment relationships between the UK and the EU are formally settled, the uncertainties will likely reduce investments and economic growth in the UK, and to some extent in Europe as well. They will present another headwind in a generally subdued global economic outlook for the next few years.",
            "As of now, MTI does not expect these developments on their own to result in a significant reduction of growth in Singapore over the short term or the next few years. However, if a European slowdown coincides with other factors, such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China or the United States, we will see a more major impact on our economy.",
            "What happens over the longer term following Brexit is even less predictable, and a deeper concern. Analysts have begun to paint the possible scenarios. In the more optimistic scenarios, the UK and EU arrive at a new and mutually beneficial arrangement for trade, investment and immigration. If as a result the UK retains substantial access to the EU single market, we should not underestimate its ability to regain economic competitiveness and strength, and to remain a valuable economic partner for us in Singapore over the long term.",
            "However, a more pessimistic state of affairs cannot be ruled out. The key unpredictability is in the political dynamics, both within the UK and in Europe. If the UK is unable to hold itself together as a union, or if nationalism gathers pace among the EU's member countries, there will very likely be a permanent weakening in their economies. More divisive politics in the UK and EU will also weaken the resolve to undertake needed economic and financial reforms for the long term.",
            "Last week, the World Bank released a report stating that the Brexit Referendum outcome has marked a \"historical shift in trade policy attitudes\", that could impair global economic growth. If we do indeed see a shift towards protectionist policies worldwide, it will have major implications for Singapore, which thrives on an open global trading system.",
            "Mdm Speaker, it is premature to say what the longer term impact of Brexit will be, positive or negative. We must watch the developments carefully, and be prepared to adjust our strategies so that we stay competitive as an economy and can retain good jobs in Singapore.",
            "Let me turn now to Mr Patrick Tay's question on the impact of Brexit on GIC and Temasek Holdings' investments. GIC and Temasek, like other major global investors, can never be insulated from volatility in the financial markets. However, both GIC and Temasek make investment decisions for the long term, and look beyond the short-term market booms and busts. Their focus with regard to Brexit, for example, is to assess how it could fundamentally alter the long-term prospects for the EU and the UK economies.",
            "From time to time, GIC and Temasek will face market dislocations. They aim to weather the ups and downs of the markets, and adopt investment strategies that can deliver good long-term returns. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis was a major case in point. Global capital markets saw much larger declines than what we saw recently with the Brexit vote. MSCI World (Equities) fell by more than 40% from its peak to the trough during the Global Financial Crisis. The value of GIC and Temasek's investment portfolios declined significantly, together with the markets. But their portfolios recovered their value within one to two years, and have continued to grow since then.",
            "Mdm Speaker, the Brexit Referendum outcome is an important turning point for the UK and the EU. We must expect a period of economic uncertainty over the next few years at least. What is especially critical is how politics will unfold in the UK and Europe. It will have lasting economic repercussions, and extending beyond Europe. We will continue to watch these developments closely, be prepared for their impact on Singapore, and see what lessons might be useful for ourselves."

            "I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for the very comprehensive response and reply. I am aware that Temasek Holdings has about 8% of its portfolio in Europe. If you look at the actual numbers, we have large stakes in British Pounds like in Stan Chart, some in Lloyds as well as in properties. How would that impact because, if you look at it as you shared earlier, it might be prolonged, coupled with the fact that we have about 70% of our investments in both Asia and Singapore by Temasek Holdings? China has recalibrated itself the past year and the next couple of years. Bearing in mind that, last year, we actually in our budget moving ahead, would be highly dependent on Temasek's Net Investment Return (NIR). Will that, in a way, require us, as we prepare for Budget 2017 and beyond, to relook at our strategies and how we position ourselves and balance our books?"

            "My guess is that it will dampen somewhat the outlook over the medium term but it is too early to say what the long-term impact will be. You have to remember that the NIR Framework is really a framework of looking at the returns over the next 20 years, which is a reasonably long period, and applying that then to the asset base in order to derive how much money can be spent in the Budget.",
            "So, I would say we should not rush to a conclusion on the long-term implications of Brexit. For that matter, as far as Temasek and GIC are concerned, they have reasonably well-diversified portfolios. Temasek has a more concentrated portfolio in Asia and it is also more concentrated in equities. Even for Temasek, if you look at its equity portfolio, it is quite well-diversified across industry sectors. So, at any one point in time, you are hit by one cycle or another, but it is the overall portfolio over the long term that determines if you are fulfilling your mission of delivering good long-term value."

            "Bilaterally, it is true that we have strengthened very significantly against the British Pound. In fact, we have got a stronger exchange rate against the Pound compared to any time in the last 35 years. That is because the Pound has collapsed in global markets. But if you look at the Singapore Dollar against a basket of currencies, it has not moved very much. In fact, it has depreciated slightly because the US Dollar and Yen have strengthened in global markets.",
            "So, essentially, this is typical of any instance that happens in the global markets, where you find that the bilateral rates move quite significantly, but, on balance, when you look at the Singapore Dollar across the whole basket of currencies, it moves in a fairly moderate fashion. In this instance, the movement has been quite contained."

In addition, financial institutions and CSPs in Singapore were named as intermediaries that had dealt with the said individuals or entities.",
            "Mdm Speaker, I should clarify at the outset that the use of offshore vehicles, in and of itself, is not illegal. Offshore vehicles can and are commonly used for legitimate purposes such as mergers and acquisitions, and estate planning. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which released the Panama Papers has indeed itself highlighted that being named in the Panama Papers does not automatically constitute basis for suspicion or evidence of wrongdoing. The approach taken by our authorities in connection with the Panama Papers, therefore, is to look into whether there was actual wrongdoing by any individual or entity in Singapore. If so, we will take firm action.",

MAS and ACRA are conducting checks to ensure that the professional intermediaries under their supervision have acted in compliance with their obligations to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.",

            "ASEAN's last consensus position on the South China Sea was reflected in the Chairman's Statement following the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Retreat in Vientiane in February this year. The Chair, Lao PDR, had emphasised that all 10 ASEAN Foreign Ministers remained seriously concerned over the recent and ongoing developments in the South China Sea, and reaffirmed the need to enhance mutual trust and confidence. In addition, there is a need for all stakeholders to exercise self-restraint in their conduct of activities, and to pursue peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law.",
            "This sentiment was most recently conveyed by the ASEAN Foreign Ministers during the Special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers' Meeting which we held in Kunming, China, on 14 June. We had a very frank and robust exchange of views on issues of mutual interest, including the situation in the South China Sea. The ASEAN Member States and China broadly reaffirmed the importance of our multi-faceted and mutually beneficial relationships. We also underscored the importance of ASEAN unity and Centrality in issues of common interest to ASEAN, including the absolute need for peace and stability and freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea.",
            "The media attention that occurred after that meeting on the failure to issue an ASEAN Joint Press Statement, in fact, reflects the importance that the international community places on ASEAN's unity and the developments in the South China Sea. The 49th ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting is scheduled in two weeks' time, and I am sure this issue will arise again.",
            "On our part, I just want to emphasise that Singapore is not currently the Chairman of ASEAN and we are also, very importantly, not a claimant State in the South China Sea. We have consistently stated that Singapore takes no position on the merits of the specific territorial claims, and the Philippines' arbitration proceedings against China was a national decision undertaken by the Philippines without consultation with the rest of us. Singapore's position on this matter has been clearly articulated in January 2013 by my predecessor, Minister K Shanmugam, here in Parliament. In brief, our position is that the overlapping sovereignty claims in the South China Sea should be settled by the parties concerned. However, this should be done in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). All parties should refrain from provocative behaviour that could raise tensions in the South China Sea.",
            "Territorial claims could be resolved by negotiations, adjudication or arbitration. The Six-Point Principles on the South China Sea that was adopted by ASEAN in 2012 clearly states that ASEAN supports the peaceful settlement of disputes, in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS. In fact, seven out of the 10 ASEAN Member States have used adjudication and/or arbitration to resolve disputes in the past. ASEAN at the highest levels has also consistently reaffirmed the principle that disputes should be settled peacefully, with full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, and this was most recently issued by our Leaders in the Sunnylands Declaration after the Special ASEAN-US Leaders' Summit in February 2016.",
            "As the current country coordinator for ASEAN-China relations, Singapore will fully support and we will facilitate the existing ASEAN-led processes to manage or to help manage the tensions in the South China Sea. We will continue to perform this role in a transparent and objective manner, with the aim of preserving ASEAN unity and credibility whilst simultaneously advancing our multi-faceted and mutually beneficial relationship with China. This includes the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and the expeditious conclusion of a legally-binding Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (COC).",
            "We have made some, albeit slow, progress in confidence-building and conflict-prevention measures. At the recent ASEAN-China Senior Officials' Meetings on the Implementation of the DOC that were co-chaired by Singapore and China, we adopted the MFA-to-MFA hotline for maritime emergencies, which will be manned on a 24/7 basis. This hotline will help build confidence amongst parties to the DOC, and hopefully help prevent ground accidents. We also have started preliminary discussions on a proposed Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), to be applied in the South China, on which I had previously briefed Members. We hope that the observance of CUES will send a positive signal and help manage the situation at sea and prevent miscalculations.",
            "Our officials have also begun looking at possible elements of the Code of Conduct but, quite frankly, this will take time. Progress has been extremely slow on this front. As the country coordinator for ASEAN-China dialogue relations and as the co-chair of the DOC process, Singapore will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to advance ASEAN unity, credibility and centrality."

So, I cannot at this point in time give you an answer with any certainty on whether there will be a joint ASEAN statement. It depends on the ruling, it depends on the respective analysis and assessments by the sovereign countries, and then it will depend on whether there is a consensus. So, we will have to wait and see. I am going to be quite busy for the next few days.",
            "Where does Singapore stand? As I said, first, we are not a claimant state, fortunately, so we have no dispute with China. We have no overlapping claims with any ASEAN Member in the South China Sea. What we stand for is we believe in a rules-based world order where decisions are made on the basis of law, on the basis of international law, and not on the basis of might or size. We believe in a peaceful resolution of disputes and, as I said earlier in my answer, including negotiations, adjudication or arbitration. In the case of Singapore, we have, on more than one occasion, used adjudication or arbitration to successfully settle disagreements. It has worked for us.",
            "Third, we need freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea because the South China Sea is a crucial avenue through which at least five trillion dollars' worth of global trade flows through. It is not enough to just talk about freedom of navigation and overflight but we all know that there needs to be a sense of security and stability, so that people who are transiting goods, services, flowing through the South China Sea, will be able to do so with some certainty and clarity. This, therefore, makes it very important that all stakeholders do not unnecessarily escalate tensions in order to make a point because such escalation of tensions will have profound impact on global trade and will affect even non-claimant states like us.",
            "The other questions on what will we do if China does not comply, I will consider that to be a hypothetical question at this point in time, and with due respect, I do not wish to engage in speculation at this point.",
            "As far as your fourth supplementary question on military activities, I would say I have addressed it earlier on. The key point is to reduce tensions and to look for peaceful resolution of differences. We believe this is still possible and we hope that cooler heads will prevail."

This year, we are aiming for 20 ELPs. The system, every year, it is always expanding. Throughout this 10-12 years of this work, we went through a global financial crisis. And at that point in time, we set up CET Centres and rolled out programmes that were needed by workers at that point in time. Should we enter a new phase where we have older PMEs or other vulnerable workers that require help, certainly, we have to set up CET Centres and ELPs that will cater to their needs. And I think this will have to be a tripartite effort."

So, that may provide opportunities for those who are seeking a second career to be referees in that sport, for instance. Can they be included under SkillsFuture?"

But maybe what you are referring to is employers or non-employers. We do support employers because some of their workers are vulnerable or they are trying to raise their productivity. So, as part of SkillsFuture, we can support them – to raise the capabilities of their workers.",
            "But there are also other employers who are trying to provide training for the entire industry and we have them. For example, Ascott has been providing training for the entire hotel industry. In those case, we have to ask them to set up a separate entity, negotiate the terms so that it continues to be open, accessible to the entire industry. And the entire industry must also be comfortable – that I am sending my workers to a particular company, maybe my competitor for training. I think industry players have to start working together to raise the standard of the industry overall."

Complementing our emphasis on values education, we also develop in our students social and emotional skills that will enable them to appreciate diversity, empathise with and demonstrate respect for others, and build positive relationships with others.",
            "To achieve this, educators role model the values, and we provide students with varied learning experiences through platforms such as Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons, Social Studies and History lessons, Values in Action programmes and Co-Curricular Activities.",
            "In CCE lessons, younger students learn the core values and related appropriate social behaviour through stories depicting everyday interactions in schools and with the community. Teachers use relevant resources from mainstream and social media to engage older students in discussion. In this way, teachers help students to see real life issues from different perspectives and how their values shape their actions. Students are also taught skills to uncover stereotypes and prejudices they may have and re-shape them, and ways to demonstrate respectful behaviours.",
            "This learning is reinforced by the inquiry approach adopted by Social Studies and History teachers, where teachers use authentic and relevant lesson resources to engage students in discussing real-world issues, such as diversity in society. For example, in the lower secondary History curriculum, students learn about the riots in post-war Singapore and the importance of managing race, religion and socio-economic challenges with sensitivity. In Social Studies, students learn that Singapore is, like many parts of the world, becoming more diverse. Singapore today has common spaces, like schools, and common experiences that foster understanding and harmony in our multicultural society. As young citizens, students learn how they can contribute to these efforts. We review and refresh our curriculum regularly to ensure that it remains sound and relevant.",
            "Through Co-Curricular Activities and Values in Action programmes, students put their values into practice. They receive feedback from teachers and peers, and reflect on them. For example, in engaging with the community in Values in Action projects, students understand the community better, form ties and are encouraged to serve in the community. Students in schools have been commemorating Racial Harmony Day every year on 21 July since 1997 to mark the racial riots of 1964. It allows them to reflect on and celebrate our success as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures, and be reminded of the importance of maintaining racial and religious harmony.",
            "In the institutes of higher learning, students continue to gain an appreciation of diversity within and outside the formal curriculum. Beyond discussing issues pertaining to diversity through modules and electives, there are events and activities such as the Global Community Day held across all polytechnics, as well as SMU's annual Diversity and Inclusion Conference which deepen our students' ability to manage diversity. The opportunity to work and live in groups also provides students ample opportunities to appreciate and manage diversity."

            ": Mdm Speaker, the social harmony we enjoy today is a precious legacy, one which we continuously work at. The focus of all our efforts, through our various initiatives and programmes, is to build bonds and understanding between people and communities, so that discrimination can be minimised. For example, the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) allow community leaders to build friendships and speak up when they see fellow Singaporeans being discriminated against, across ethnic and religious lines. The National Integration Council works to reduce discrimination along foreign-local lines. Our Youth Corps reaches out to all segments of society, including the elderly. Through its events and programmes, the People's Association reaches out to residents from all races, age groups and socio-economic backgrounds to promote social cohesion and racial harmony. When we see each other as friends, and as fellow Singaporeans, the tendency to cause hurt will be reduced.",
            "We are not alone in our efforts. Other Ministries and agencies also work to reduce discrimination. For example, in the workplace, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) takes a promotional and capability building approach in helping employers adopt fair employment practices and addressing employment discrimination. The Government has also made efforts towards eliminating gender stereotypes as well as discrimination based on age, race or religion through civic education in schools as well as through public education. More generally, the Media Development Authority (MDA)'s Programme Code for TV states that programmes should not encourage or in any way discriminate against any section of the community on account of gender, age, disability or occupational status.",
            "We also have legislation in place to protect minority interests and to uphold a fair and harmonious society. Our Constitution guarantees that all persons are equal before the law. We have legislative safeguards such as the Presidential Council for Minority Rights, which protects the rights of minorities; the Sedition Act and the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, which act as a deterrent against any group attempting to cause racial and religious conflict; and the Employment Act which protects employees against unfair dismissal.",
            "While measuring discrimination is not easily quantifiable, we have surveys on attitudes that we can use. For instance, as an indication of the state of racial and religious harmony, a survey by OnePeople.SG and the Institute of Policy Studies in 2013 showed that eight out of 10 respondents were comfortable having a close friend from another race or religion. As a measure of the state of our gender equality, the UN's 2015 Human Development Report ranked Singapore 13th out of 155 countries on the Gender Inequality Index, which means that we are good, right up there in the top percentile – the lower the ranking, the higher you are – we are more equal.",
            "In the long run, the harmony in our society speaks for the work we do. However, we can also do more as individual citizens by speaking out against discrimination, be it derogatory speech or exclusivist attitudes. The battle against discrimination is an ongoing one, and as a society, we must continue to maximise our common space, minimise our divides, and move forward as one united people."

One is whether the Ministry is open to the idea of discussing such sensitive issues on a platform which has a wider public outreach and more formal such as SG Future Forum. I believe such discussions will allow public awareness on these issues. Secondly, what are the processes that MCCY use to review current and on-going efforts to address discrimination to improve on the existing work in this area? And lastly, how does MCCY support efforts to address discrimination in areas covered by other Ministries and Government agencies such as MOM and TAFEP, to understand and deal with workplace discrimination?

            ": Thank you, Madam. On the Member's suggestion about discussing sensitive issues in a broader forum, we are undertaking such an effort to discuss sensitive issues with groups comprising youth leaders as well as amongst school leaders. Also, in IRCCs and IRO, we have held conferences as large as 200-300 strong to discuss issues confronting us on the racial and religious lines. So, these are our efforts towards sanitising people of all segments with larger groups to come together to have a good, frank discussion about the challenges that we are facing as a nation and what we can do to help ourselves build a stronger and united people.",
            "With regard to MCCY reviewing the processes of whether we have been successful in promoting racial harmony, I think my answer has actually been prepared on that basis. I note that supplementary question is very similar to your original PQ. So, I think I have answered the question that you have posed. And whether MCCY reviews the successes of the other agencies, of course, we work very closely with our sister agencies, for example, on the National Integration Council, we have MOM leading the sectoral discussion on workplace. We also have different agencies represented on the National Integration Council which is represented by many Ministers.",
            "So, I think in short, this is a very important question for us because as a very young nation, we do have our natural fault-lines along race and racial perspective but also increasingly, we have new fault-lines, we have new forces that are pulling us apart. And even more established societies are finding themselves being pulled in many directions. So, nation-building, social cohesion is an on-going process. It is a key focus of MCCY but it is also receiving attention from many agencies and Ministries. And I think as community leaders, all of us here in this House have a role to send a very positive message to our community because how we treat each other – do we take an inclusive view or an exclusive view, I think will set the mood for our community. And I encourage the Member to help us to move social cohesion along the line of greater unity and greater cohesion. And I look forward to you playing an important role in your community towards building a stronger people."

            "Madam, in July 2009, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed to boost its capacity to lend to low-income countries impacted by the global financial crisis, through a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). The PRGT is the IMF's concessional lending vehicle, which provides lending facilities tailored to the diverse needs of low-income countries. To fund the PRGT, IMF members agreed in 2012 to contribute at least 90% of distributed profits from the sales of gold holdings at the IMF.",
            "As a highly open economy and international financial centre, Singapore has a strong stake in preserving a healthy global economic environment. This includes doing our part in the IMF's efforts to assist low-income countries. The PRGT will help support developing countries in Asia, such as Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam, whom we share growing economic ties with.",
            "The amendments to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act will allow MAS to participate in the PRGT through a US$20 million grant paid from Singapore's share of the IMF's gold sales profit. The grant is subject to Parliament's approval. Any future grant to the IMF will also require Parliament's approval.",
            "Mdm Speaker, I will now go through the main amendments of the Bill.",
            "Firstly, key provisions of setting out powers to provide financial assistance to the IMF, including loans, grants and interest-free deposits.",
            "MAS currently has powers to provide loans and interest-free deposits to the IMF under the MAS Act, but not grants. So, the Bill will empower MAS to make grants to the IMF, but only with Parliament's approval. The amendments will also consolidate MAS' existing powers to provide financial assistance to the IMF, including loans and interest-free deposits, into this single Act.",
            "The second key provision is about setting out strong safeguards when providing financial assistance to the IMF.",
            "The Bill will add the following safeguards that apply when MAS provides any loans, grants or other financial assistance to the IMF.",
            "First, any financial assistance can only be provided pursuant to a specific request from the IMF. In addition, MAS will provide financial assistance only as part of collective action among IMF members.",
            "Second, in the interest of transparency, the Minister-in-charge of MAS must publish in the Gazette a statement containing key information about the financial assistance. This statement will contain a description of the nature and terms of the agreement to lend, give grants or other financial assistance, and the maximum amount that MAS has agreed to lend or give to the IMF. While MAS has in the past issued media statements and provided answers in Parliament on such assistance, such as in the case of MAS' contingent loan to the IMF in 2012, a Gazette notice, as required in this Bill, will provide further transparency.",
            "Third, specifically in the case of a grant to be given by MAS to the IMF, the Bill provides that Parliament's approval by specific resolution is required. This is because grants are treated as expenses. This is unlike loans to IMF which are to be repaid at maturity, and are recorded as assets in MAS' balance sheet. Loans to the IMF remain part of Singapore's Official Foreign Reserves, which are managed by MAS as the central bank.",
            "Next, let me touch on some of the provisions for early repayment. Currently, agreements to provide loans to the IMF include a safeguard that obliges the IMF to immediately repay the loan in the event that Singapore has a balance of payments need.",
            "The Bill will introduce a new safeguard for loans and other financial assistance provided to the IMF. Such agreements must include provisions for MAS to require early repayment in the event of suspension, or premature termination, of the IMF programme for which the assistance was provided.",
            "Mdm Speaker, it is in Singapore's interest to continue to support the IMF as a global multilateral institution and its efforts to maintain a stable global financial system. The introduction of the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill will enable Singapore to support the IMF initiative to help low-income countries in times of crisis. Madam, I beg to move."

            "In particular, the proposed amendments to the Act allowed MAS to make grants and other financial assistances to IMF's concessional lending facility known as Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). The PRGT was set up primarily to lend to low-income countries who may be severely impacted by catastrophes, natural disasters, epidemic or global financial crises.",
            "The amendments also instituted additional safeguards such as requiring Parliament's approval for the provision of the grants and that the Minister in charge of MAS must also publish in the Gazette a statement containing details of the financial agreement.",
            "I support the amendment to empower the MAS as well as the safeguards put in place over MAS' exercise of powers. From a humanitarian standpoint, I would also agree with the Government's position that we need to do our part and contribute our humble share to help poorer countries impacted by various calamities from time to time. It is also in our interest to see greater international cooperation in dealing with the various global challenges that we face and for the spirit of Bretton Woods to come to bear and continues. After all, we hope to live in a global village where the community of nations makes efforts to help each other in need and each doing our part to alleviate poverty.",
            "However, Mdm Speaker, I do have few questions for the Minister.",
            "I understand from the Minister's speech that the additional funds for the PRGT initiative is paid for from the profits arising from the IMF's sale of part of its gold holdings. The member states have agreed to this arrangement and Singapore's share of contribution to PRGT amounted to US$20 million. I would like to ask the Minister: does our gold holdings at IMF form part of our official foreign reserves and hence, would the conversion of the sales profits from the disposal of our gold holdings into financial grant to PRGT constitute a spending on reserves?",
            "Secondly, I would like to as the Minister whether does he envisage that IMF will request for more contributions from member countries and in particular, asking for bigger contributions from Singapore? This is against the backdrop and the increasing trend of Western countries under political pressure to reduce their commitment to foreign aid. Would the PRGT be able to self-sustain its concessionary lending capacity over the long term with this latest contribution?",
            "Thirdly, section 6A (2)(b) of the amended act states that MAS need to satisfy that at least one other government would be willing to provide the financial assistance in response to IMF's request before the grant or financial assistance can be given. I would like to ask the Minister whether that would be setting the bar too low with just one other government needing to consent to provide the financial assistance. What is the rationale and why would we not require more governments to participate before we assist, given that IMF is a multilateral participatory organisation? In this case, I understand that PRGT has already obtained support of more than 80% of the member countries.",
            "Mdm Speaker, we live in an increasingly connected global neighbourhood where events or calamities that happen in one end of the globe could have impact and ramifications on other faraway locations, financial or otherwise.",
            "As a highly open economy and international financial centre, it would also serve us well to support IMF's multilateral efforts to improve livelihood of poorer countries, develop sustainable economic growth and to preserve the global financial stability. Mdm Speaker, with that, I support the amendment."

We have seen how many bigger countries faced economic crisis because of their lack of prudence in safeguarding their reserves. This does not include such earthquakes in the financial market as the collapse of the subprime market in the US, the Eurozone debt crisis, the recent sharp decline in oil prices and other commodities. Governments need to carefully scrutinise their spending and to be honest when making hard decisions. The leaders must take the honourable step to be prepared to explain to the people on any difficult decisions rather than take the road of least resistance to win popularity.",
            "Today, the IMF is called into play to help support or rescue governments for a variety of reasons. Across the globe, Angola is the latest to seek a bailout from the IMF that could be worth more than US$1.5 billion. This oil-producing OPEC member is seeking international help to cope with the fallout from low crude prices. Others like Greece are still struggling and tapping on IMF bailout fund.",
            "Singapore, as a small nation, can take pride to be able to contribute to the IMF. We even hosted the 61st annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank board of governors in 2006. Today, we are also the home for the IMF-Singapore Training Institute, serving as the regional training centre for the Asia-Pacific region on macroeconomic and financial management.",
            "I am supportive of the Amendment Bill, in particular, the new addition in Section 6(a) with strong safeguards set out when providing the financial assistance, including loans and grants to the IMF. For example, the arrangement that the financial assistance will be given if at least one other government has provided or intend to provide assistance in response to a similar request from the IMF. In the case of grants, additional safeguards were set out with the need for Parliament's approval. That is, powers to give grants to the IMF are subject to Parliament's approval, given the nature of grants as an expense and not an asset. This is an important additional safeguard.",
            "However, while I support the Amendment Bill, I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.",
            "First, whether we should set a limit for the total financial assistance including loans, grants and other forms of financial assistance under section 6A, sub section (2)(c)(ii). And I feel we should put a limit based on a percentage of our current GDP or of our reserves, with a cap on a maximum, and whichever is lower. One approach could be via 1% of GDP or about $4 billion or 2% of reserves or around $5 billion or on a per capita basis per Singapore citizen. This is on top of what is in sub-section 2(d) which has already stated that the Parliament by resolution will fix the maximum amount of grants to be given by MAS. This is because any loan or grant to the IMF under any agreements will be paid out of the MAS' reserves.

            "Second, for the loan component in section 6(A) subsection (4), can the Minister also share with the House, if for some reason Singapore faces a balance of payment crisis – as you have mentioned earlier, Minister – and we are in need of the fund, what is the minimum time-frame required to notify our need for earlier repayments?",
            "Third, for accountability and transparency under subsection 2 (c), in conjunction with the Minister's published Gazette, will MAS publish the statement on the maximum amount of financial assistance in the local media on the key information about the agreement to extend financial assistance so that the public can scrutinise it and to publish it before the Parliament debates the issue?",
            "I think what is important is for all governments to work together to find a way to strengthen and maintain global financial stability. Our participation via IMF would in some ways be contributing to bringing stability to the recipient country or countries. Otherwise, a country or countries which is/are trying to rebuild its economy would find its efforts scuppered by crisis in another country.",
            "In Singapore, we have been enjoying financial stability though we are occasionally tested by outside events. Stability also means we need to continually ensure that our citizens are able to take some of the jabs without suffering a knock-out. Indeed, our main defensive block is our reserves. So, we must ensure we have sufficient safeguards with regard to any matter that affects our official or MAS' reserves, no matter how small.",

Indeed, we would have read of how families suffered because of job losses due to the collapse in their country's economy. The bailout terms would require the borrowing governments to make painful cuts expenditure, resulting in job losses. Hence, those whose jobs were affected would take to the streets and protest. These are all very frightening scenarios which happened in other countries. Thankfully, we do not see this in Singapore.",

            "As a country, we have benefitted from our membership in the institutions, especially in our early years as a developing nation. As mentioned by the hon Member Dr Lee Bee Wah, Singapore received loans from the World Bank – about 14 loans between 1963 and 1975 to develop our sewage, water, power and telecommunications infrastructure.",
            "Now, it is right for us to do our part to support the IMF in its effort to provide assistance to the development of low income member countries or LICs, particularly under the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). We live in an increasingly complex world, interconnected and interdependent where no one country is really immune from developments on another. In this regard, I quote the President of the World Bank Group Mr Jim Yong Kim in a speech he delivered on 5 April 2016:",
            "\"It has never been so painfully clear that the world is deeply interconnected. Major issues that evolve in a developing country now swiftly move to affect developed countries – and",
            "vice versa",
            "– more than ever before. Climate change, pandemics, refugees, terrorism, and economic downturns all move seamlessly around the world.\"",
            "The above-mentioned impact applies all the more to an open economy like Singapore.",
            "The Bretton Woods Agreement (Amendment) Bill proposes amendments to the Act to allow MAS to lend or give grants or to provide other financial assistance to the IMF to support its programmes. I support the amendments proposed in the Bill.",
            "While the intentions and motivations are commendable, given that this involves matters of our country's finances, I would like to highlight four areas of concern in respect of the applicable safeguards.",
            "First, the proposed new section 6A of the Act requires that the MAS be satisfied that at least one other Government has provided, or intends to provide financial assistance in response to a similar request from the IMF to provide financial assistance. The hon Member Mr Liang feels that this is setting the bar too low. However, in the explanatory brief issued by the MAS on 9 May 2016, MAS said that it would only agree to a request for financial assistance where there is a collective and broad-based response amongst IMF members. I would like to ask the Minister why the stance was taken by the MAS appears to be rather more stringent than what is reflected in the wording of section 6A?",
            "Second, the Explanatory Statement to the Bill states that any loan or grant to the IMF will be paid out of the MAS' reserves. Loans are treated as monetary assets and are recorded as such on MAS' books. In contrast, grants are treated as expenses. For this reason, the proposed new section 6A(d) specifically requires Parliamentary approval on the quantum of the grant before a grant may be given. I agree that the Parliament safeguard is necessary.",
            "However, we have another safeguard in the form of the Elected President. Article 22B(6) and (7) of the Constitution requires the MAS and its CEO to inform the President of any proposed transaction of the MAS which is likely to draw on MAS' reserves, and the President, acting in his discretion, may disapprove the proposed transaction. Could the Minister please clarify whether this constitutional safeguard would apply to a loan or grant given to the IMF given that it will be paid out of MAS' reserves? If so, in the context of grants, would MAS be expected to engage the President before or after Parliament is asked to provide approval?",
            "Third, where loans to the IMF are concerned, have we considered the possibility that such loans may not be repaid at maturity and may eventually be written-off? I highlight this in particular as the wording of the proposed section 6A of the Act contemplates that the financial assistance requested by the IMF may be provided directly to a recipient country. This approach of providing assistance directly to the recipient country is also contemplated in other legislation such as the Australian legislation. If so, Singapore would be taking on the direct credit risk of the recipient country and not the credit risk of the IMF. As such, if there is a loan default situation, what would be the treatment of the decision to write-off such loans? Would it be treated as an expenditure of the MAS reserves? Would a write-off require Parliamentary and Presidential approval under the proposed Bill or the Constitution?",
            "Fourth, I have a concern relating to the phrase \"other financial assistance\" at the proposed section 6A of the Act. Section 8C of the Australian International Monetary Agreements Act is similar to our section 6A in that it allows Australia to provide assistance to another country in support of a fund programme. The Australian Act is restricted in the scope of financial assistance that may be provided as it only allows the Treasurer of Australia to enter into an agreement to lend money or to enter into a currency swap. No other financial assistance are contemplated.",
            "In our proposed section 6A, the wording is wider. Could the Minister please clarify, besides interest-free deposits which have been identified by the MAS in its explanatory brief, what other types of financial assistance are contemplated and will they also likely to be also drawn from MAS' reserves? In particular, does section 6A contemplate the giving of guarantees? If so, does this not engage Article 144(1) of the Constitution, such that the President's concurrence is required before the guarantee may be given?",
            "While I appreciate the need to maintain some flexibility as to the form of financial assistance to be provided, given that we have safeguards in the Constitution and the proposed Bill that would engage either or both the President and Parliament, would it not be better for the Act to specify the types of financial assistance that may be given?",
            "In conclusion, it is right for Singapore to do her part in assisting other developing nations just like she once benefitted from such assistance. However, we must also balance providing financial assistance with exercising prudence when spending our reserves. Mdm Speaker, notwithstanding my request for the Government to review and clarify the safeguards, I support the Bill."

            "These amendments will result in more financial assistance for lower income member countries. For a start, as Minister mentioned, Singapore will be able to contribute our share of the IMF's gold sales profit, which will amount to a grant of US$20 million to the PRGT.",
            "This proposal for the contribution of the above sales profit is supported by 80% of IMF members and this is a timely move for Singapore to support this as well, in direct response to repeated calls by the IMF for the world to act together, urgently.",
            "In April this year, IMF chief, Christine Lagarde, warned that time was running out to revive the global economy. A few months before that, a report to G20 leaders called for strong policy responses at the national and multilateral levels to propel the global economy to a more prosperous path.",
            "It does not take an economist to realise that we are entering into a changing economic climate. The global economy is facing latent fissures in the form of falling oil prices and China's slowdown.",
            "Amid these economic threats, global powers are also struggling to cope with the refugee crisis, religious extremism and political unrest. We know that the IMF – as the global crisis lender – is not optimistic. After careful observations of global trends, they have cut their global growth forecast for the fourth time this year.",
            "The amendments allowing for increased contributions to the IMF will allow it to fight fires in the global economy. Crisis prevention is an international effort, and Singapore must act, must contribute and must help. A strong Singaporean response in a time like this can only signal our resolve to maintain global stability, placing Singapore at the forefront and as a leader.",
            "This act of global goodwill will also bode us well. For a trade-reliant country like ours, a stable and healthy global economy will only serve our interests. By contributing to IMF's war chest and bolstering emergency funds for weaker economies, we are ultimately building a firewall for ourselves. In these times of uncertainty, we must do all we can to ensure the global economic climate remains favourable to Singapore.",
            "But this is not just about the Singapore economy, about Singapore's interest, about the dollars and cents. It is also about showing that despite being a tiny red dot, we can be a shining example of a small country with a big impact, a small country of responsible global citizens, we can be a shining red dot.",
            "For me, this really is about sharing and giving, the lessons we teach our children in schools and the lessons I am currently teaching my daughter. When she is playing with other children and they want to play with the toy she is playing with, I tell her to share. Let others also have a chance to play. I am also teaching her to give and donate. I started passing her coins to put into donation tins in shops and explain to her why she is putting the coins in the tins.",
            "But I am afraid this has been a failed experiment so far. I doubt she understands why but she does enjoy putting the coins in the tins and she now insist on putting coins in every donation tin we walk past. I mentioned previously that she has learnt to say the word, \"no\" but I am afraid I have not learnt to say the word, \"no\" to her especially when she has now learnt the words, \"Daddy, please\".",
            "But I am sure she will eventually understand why she is putting coins in tins. Perhaps, the best way to teach is to show by the example. As parents, we need to show that we share and we give. As a Government, we need to lead by example and show that we not just teach sharing and giving in our schools but that we practice what we preach.",

            ": Mdm Speaker, I thank the Members, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Louis Ng, all of whom have spoken and given the support of the Bill.",
            "While the Members have highlighted the continued relevance of the IMF in maintaining a stable, global financial and economic environment, and the importance for Singapore to do our part in the IMF's multilateral efforts to assist low-income countries. Members have raised a number of issues and I will address them in turn.",
            "First, Mr Liang asked if the grant to the IMF's PRGT will constitute in expense on our official foreign reserves. Madam, I would like to clarify that the gold holdings in the IMF belong to the IMF. It is not Singapore's gold or members' gold. It is the IMF's gold holdings. And when the IMF sold its gold to raise funds for the PRGT, the proceeds arising from the gold sales were distributed to members in proportion to their quota shares, provided members agreed to contribute the proceeds as grants to the PRGT.",
            "So, the proceeds on the gold sales in 2012 and 2013, due to MAS, were recorded as income in the IMF's books temporarily and would be exactly offset when MAS makes the grant with the PRGT. The net effect of this is that this entire transaction – income and outflow of grants – will not affect our overall level of official foreign reserves.",
            "As countries around the world face increased risk economic and financial disruptions arising from a broad range of factors, the IMF will review its financial assistance toolkit from time to time to see how it can assist countries. Where new initiatives are proposed, we will consider contributing to such initiatives where relevant and as part of a multi-lateral effort. As I said earlier, any future grant will also similarly be subject to Parliament's approval. So, that is on the first point about the transaction mechanism, and whether it has an impact on our official foreign reserves.",
            "Second, Mr Liang also asked whether the PRGT will be self-sustaining and if we expect more requests from member countries by IMF. Self-sustainability is indeed one of the key considerations for the PRGT fund raising initiatives. The pledges made by IMF members so far have increased the PRGT's annual lending capacity from US$1 billion to US$1.75 billion so far. The IMF estimates that these additional resources will be able to sustain the PRGT lending for two decades. So, that is an estimate with the IMF has already made to ensure that the PRGT is on a sound, sustainable, financial footing.",
            "Next, Mr Liang and Mr Murali asked about the rationale behind section 6A(2b) of the Bill which requires that MAS be satisfied that at least one other government has provided or intends to provide financial assistance in response to the IMF request, before MAS can agree to such requests.",
            "Madam, I would like to clarify that this section was incorporated to preclude Singapore from making grants to the IMF purely on our own. Thus, the key phrase is \"at least one other government\", but in practice, I would like to assure Members that MAS will carefully assess any IMF requests for financial assistance on a case by case basis, and we will participate only where it is in our interest to do so, and only as part of a multilateral effort.",
            "And as Mr Liang highlighted, IMF has acted with about 80% of IMF members, which is more than 140 countries to pledge grants with the PRGT from members' shares of the IMF's gold sale proceeds.",
            "Next, Mr Murali also asked if Article 22B(6) and (7) of the Constitution – basically, the Constitution safeguards on the reserves – would apply to any of the financial assistance to the IMF. I would like to clarify that the Article 22B(6) of the Constitution refers to transactions which are likely to draw on the reserves accumulated by a Statutory Board prior to the current term of office of the Government. And indeed, as with any proposed such transaction, including any financial assistance to the IMF, the President would be informed if MAS has to draw on past reserves.",
            "If Article 22B(6) of the Constitution is engaged because a grant is likely to draw on past reserves, then MAS would inform the President before going to Parliament to obtain a resolution. But in this context, I would like to reassure Members that we do not expect any financial assistance to the IMF to require funding from past reserves. So, we do not expect any financial assistance to IMF to have to be funded from past reserves as MAS is most unlikely to participate in any scheme should this arise.",
            "Mr Murali also asked about the possibility that loans with the IMF may not be repaid. I would like to clarify first of all that section 6A of the Bill does not in fact allow Singapore to provide financial assistance directly to a country borrowing from the IMF. Where we provide a loan in support of an IMF programme for the benefit of one or more countries, we are providing the loan to the IMF and entering into an agreement with the IMF. We are taking on the credit risk of the IMF rather than the direct credit risk of the countries that the IMF lends to. This is similar to the low risk that is associated with the MAS' subscriptions to the capital of the IMF. As the IMF enjoys preferred creditor status, loans granted by the IMF must be repaid ahead of all other creditors. The IMF with the advantage it has from its preferred creditor status and sizeable reserves that it can use to protect its members has always repaid its own creditors.",
            "Mr Murali also raised the question about what forms of other financial assistance MAS would make under the Bill and whether this includes the giving of guarantees and if the Bill should specify the types of financial assistance that can be given.",
            "Madam, the amendments in the Bill will allow MAS to make grants to the IMF and consolidate existing powers to provide loans and interest-free deposits to the IMF. We expect these to be the main forms of assistance that MAS would give to the IMF in the foreseeable future. We have not been approached to give a guarantee to the IMF nor do we expect to do so. I think the Member highlighted Article 144 in the Constitution stating that \"no guarantee or loan should be given or raised by the Government unless the President concurs\". Article 144 does not apply to loans raised or guarantees given by a person other than the Government. And MAS is a separate vehicle from the Government. As such, Article 144 of the Constitution will not be engaged. Nevertheless, I should reiterate that MAS has not had to assist the IMF in the past by giving a guarantee; we have never had to do that and we do not expect to do so.",
            "Mr Saktiandi Bin Supaat asked if a limit should be set over the total financial assistance that can be provided to the IMF and whether there should be some form of methodology to derive this total amount that is stipulated in our various agreements with the IMF.",
            "I want to emphasise that the MAS considers each IMF request for financial assistance carefully and exercises a high degree of prudence on whether or not to contribute. It may not be so practical to set the limit given that there will be times of crisis when we think we should do our part to contribute to IMF resourcing initiatives. And indeed this was the case in 2012, when we provided a contingent loan to the IMF at the time of heightened global risk. And in fact, I think I should also elaborate that as I have said earlier in my opening speech, it is in Singapore's interest to do our part to contribute to a stable global financial and economic environment because of our role as a financial hub. So, it is in fact not just an obligation but it is also in our interest to make a contribution to ensure a stable, economic and financial environment which we, in turn, will benefit from.",
            "I should also explain that each member of the IMF is assigned a quota based broadly on its relative size in the world economy including GDP, openness of its economy and its international reserves. This quota determines a member's voting power and it is also used as a benchmark for the IMF to apportion potential financial assistance to the IMF. So, this is already in place. For instance, the IMF distributed gold sale proceeds to members in proportion to their quotas to be re-contributed to the PRGT, as I have explained earlier.",
            "Singapore's current quota share is about 0.82% of total IMF quotas and this remains a useful benchmark for deriving the financial assistance we provide to the IMF on a case-by-case basis.",
            "Finally, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Saktiandi Bin Supaat also asked about publication, and whether we should go beyond the publication of the Gazette to a broader statement to inform the public and I agree that we should do so. It is precisely for accountability and transparency that we want to make sure that the publication is made not just in a Gazette but to ensure that members of the public are informed of what we are doing and there can be a robust debate to Parliament, if need be.",
            "Finally, Mr Mr Saktiandi Bin Supaat asked how much advance notice the IMF needs to repay Singapore's loans to the IMF in the event that we face a balance of payment crisis. Under MAS' existing agreement with the IMF, the IMF is obliged to immediately and fully repay the loan upon request. So, it is obliged to repay immediately and fully. In the event that such a scenario arises, where we have a balance of payments need, that is the obligation of the IMF to repay immediately and fully. The IMF have set aside more than US$120 billion, as a buffer to ensure its ability to repay creditors early, if and when such an emergency emerges.",

            "Immediately after being elected, I received correspondence from Bukit Batok residents who have special needs children. They highlighted their plights to me. I also had the opportunity to hold in-depth discussions with affected family members and representatives from stakeholders involved in the provision of care to special needs children.",

            "On the 26 of June 2016, I attended the Bukit Batok Swim Meet co-organised by ActiveSG and Bukit Batok Constituency Sports Club at the Bukit Batok Swimming Complex. There I met Mdm Yap, a single parent with her 10-year-old daughter, Amelia. Amelia is a warm and charming girl. She even try to cheekily plant a kiss on my cheek when I was not looking.",
            "Amelia suffers from Mild Intellectual Disability (MID) and Global Development delay (GDD). Mdm Yap entered Amelia for two competitive events: the 50-metre freestyle and the 50-metre breaststroke. Amelia has physical coordination issues and did not always listen to instructions. Mdm Yap had to remind her which proper stroke to use and how to end the race, namely to touch the walls with two hands for breaststroke and one for freestyle. She spends a lot of time and energy to help Amelia compete. In the end, Amelia completed both races successfully. She and her mother received a great reception from the audience who loudly cheered Amelia along. The organisers also decided to give Amelia a medal for her commendable effort. Mr Yap was encouraged by this gesture.",
            "I am sharing this as a good example of how our community provided the empathy, encouragement and support for both the care-giver and the child with special needs in their endeavours.",
            "This does not appear to be a given unfortunately. The Lien Foundation survey, results of which were published in the media last week on 4 July 2016, revealed amongst others the following results in its poll of general public and parents of children with special needs: only 28% of those surveyed agreed that Singapore is an inclusive society when it comes to special needs children.",
            "Whilst a great majority of parents surveyed, about 71%, supported inclusive education, only slightly more than half, 58%, will be comfortable with their child attending the same school as a child with special needs. Only 32% of the general public polled believe that typically developing children comfortable interacting with children of special needs.",
            "Anecdotally, I have heard accounts that support the impression created by the numbers that Singaporeans are generally less comfortable when dealing with mentally disabled persons.",
            "A mother of a mildly autistic child told me that she enrolled her child in a mainstream kindergarten. The child would go to the school in the morning with a full pencil case, only to return home with just a ruler. Apparently, the child's classmates took advantage of her condition and helped themselves to the stationery. I asked the mother whether she would bought this matter up to the attention of teachers. She informed me that the typical response of the teachers, as the kindergarten does not have any allied professionals to help in such situations, would be to recommend that her child be enrolled in a special needs school instead.",
            "Another mother spoke to me about a problem which appeared at first glance, a simple one to solve but turned out to be rather complex because of the positions taken by the relevant stakeholders. She drops her autistic son at the childcare centre every morning. She arranged for bus service to have him picked up from the childcare centre at about 11.30 am and sent to a special needs school. She asked the childcare centre to help escort her son into the bus. The centre refused on account that it does not fall within the scope of work. They went on to highlight that the other parents would also ask for the same service if they would to make an exception for her case. The bus service staff also was not able to help and their explanation is understandable because they could not spare anyone else to pick him up because other special needs children in the bus also need tending to.",
            "As a society, we need to address this situation. We must change our attitudes towards special needs persons and their caregivers. We have always prided ourselves as being an inclusive society when it comes to race, language, religion, social classes. Indeed, the caregivers I have spoken to, have uniformly acknowledged that great strides have been taken in the past few years by the Government to enhance the support given to special needs children.",
            "There is absolutely no reason why a line has to be drawn within our society when it comes to treatment of persons with special needs. Gone are the days, when people suffering from mental issues are just locked up in lunatic asylums. For the vast majority of our special needs children, we must take care of them within our community and provide them the opportunities they need to lead fulfilling lives.",
            "I am not convinced though that legislation would be the right response. Rather, I would advocate that we do more to promote better understanding of special needs children and the challenges they face within our community. We could emulate what my Parliamentary colleague, Ms Tin Pei Ling, has been doing in MacPherson. I learnt that she conducted training lessons for her grassroots leaders so that they are better able to identify and deal with persons with mental disabilities. I do believe by gaining a good understanding of special needs children and their challenges, our fellow Singaporeans and residents would change their attitudes towards special needs children, develop their empathy and provide better support for them and their caregivers.",
            "We should, perhaps, through relevant agencies like Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) promote amongst support stakeholders such as childcare centres, kindergartens and even school bus operators, the implementation of a code of conduct or best practices to encourage them to take the extra step to help caregivers and their special needs children.",
            "Turning specifically to adult children with special needs, Members of this House have highlighted on previous occasions the need to provide more help to adult children with special needs after they turn 18 and graduate from the education system. We have also heard assurances from the Government that it would look at ways and means to enhance the level of support. The support to be provided, I understand, is primarily two-fold: to provide better institutional support and bespoke job opportunities that would fit their circumstances.",
            "I do not propose to repeat what has already been said. I do, however, wish to update the House that the waiting time to get a place for one of the three Day Activity Centres for Autistic Adults stands at two years. This is, in my respectful opinion, is too long. The caregivers will have to bear the brunt of the problem, and they will be put under tremendous stress and anxiety. Also, the special needs children with moderate to severe forms of disabilities may unlearn what they have learnt in school. This results in a waste of resources.",
            "I further propose that caregivers of adult children with moderate to severe forms of special needs to be given the same form of grants and concessions that caregivers of disabled or the elderly or the young enjoy with respect to employment of foreign domestic maids. This will hopefully give the caregivers some level of respite.",
            "I would also advocate that the Government look at providing more funding support to encourage the adoption of models that would enhance the employability of adult children with special needs within the Day Activity Centres; for example, in the horticultural or cafeteria arenas. Whilst these models cost more money to run, they may make more sense in a long run as it provides our adult children with a sense of purpose and enable them to contribute to society at the same time.",
            "There may also be an economic basis for this enhanced funding. A study by researchers from the University of California and Old Dominion University published in a seminal article on autism appearing in",
            "T",
            "he Economist",
            "on 16 April 2016 reveals that the lifetime cost of supporting an autistic American is much lesser than the opportunity cost, referring to an estimate of the output lost when autistic people are jobless or under-employed or when their caregivers leave their jobs to take care of them. There is no reason to suggest that the situation in Singapore is any different.",
            "In conclusion, I wish to draw attention to a speech that the Prime Minister made in December 2015 towards the end of the SG50 celebrations about the need to build a more inclusive, fair and just society that respects and values all, including the disabled. He quoted the late Mr S Rajaratnam who famously spoke about building \"a democracy of deeds\" and that \"ultimately it is the quality and character of the individual citizens rather than the blueprints and programmes which decide whether a society is good or bad… a success or failure.\"",
            "We are dealing with an area which the Government cannot just decree a change in attitude. This must come from within our society. It depends on each individual and each family. Each of us has a part to play in treating the caregivers and their special need children with empathy, providing them with the welcome, support and encouragement they so rightly deserve."

          "speaker": "Mr Tan Chuan-Jin",
          "content": [
            ": Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for his feedback and the concerns that have been raised regarding the needs of caregivers and Persons with Disabilities. My Ministry, together with the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) and SG Enable, have been conducting ground consultations as part of our Enabling Masterplan 3 and also other focus groups which we carry out through the year to find out more about the needs of Persons with Disabilities and also that of their Caregivers. Through these sessions, we have developed a reasonably decent understanding of the concerns and challenges faced by caregivers in providing care for their loved ones, and the feedback provided by Mr Murali is consistent with those inputs. There are a range of other issues that many families are concerned about as well.",
            "I would like to take this opportunity to update the House and members of the public because it is an area that is vitally important for us. While we have made important progress in the past several years, there is still a lot more that we can do. We will continue to improve and expand services to meet the needs of Persons with Disabilities and their caregivers. Certainly, this is a very important focus for my Ministry, especially as we address these issues in the Enabling Masterplan 3.",
            "But I would say this: In order for the Government to be able to move forward, we cannot do it alone. It really requires the whole community to be involved – the VWOs, private organisations and individuals. When we talk about building an inclusive society, it is not just about bringing on board different Singaporeans with different abilities and to help them be included in the rest of society and in what we do. It is about all of us being included in the process of welcoming other Singaporeans on board because without the effort of all of us, this cannot happen.",
            "Allow me to take the opportunity to provide an overview of the concerns and issues and where we are as a society, and let me cover some of the main themes.",
            "First, the issue of awareness within the community of Persons with Disabilities. Clearly, from the survey done by the Lien Foundation and certainly from the surveys done by MSF as well, it shows that while we have made progress and while many Singaporeans do express concerns about these issues, whether we actually walk-the-talk or not does not always reflect what we say. As we work towards the vision of an inclusive society, community acceptance is essential and public education efforts will play a very important part. I totally agree with the Member – you cannot legislate these things. In fact, when you legislate, sometimes, it may get in the way because it forces people to begin to just follow the letter of the law without changing the spirit of it. A lot of interactions actually come from not the formal interactions but out day-to-day interactions which you cannot formally legislate. It is about a change in mindset; it is about a change in climate that we need to effect in our society.",
            "Recently, we launched a campaign called the \"We are Able\" campaign and the recent \"See the True Me\" campaign by NCSS. It is essentially aimed at helping to raise awareness about the abilities and contributions of Persons with Disabilities. We do need to create an environment where Persons with Disabilities can live enabled lives. Campaigns play a part but there are also practical actions that can be undertaken. For example, promoting the employment of people with different abilities within the workspace. It goes a very long way in transforming the cultures of the companies. In fact, many of the companies which have embraced this have shared with us that what they have found to have changed is the climate within the companies. When you have fellow Singaporeans with different abilities within your ranks and they go out of the way to accommodate and to adjust what they do, they find that it softens the work culture. I think that is the kind of transformative effect that we hope to see at the workplace, in schools and beyond. And slowly, hopefully, a tipping point can be reached.",
            "A second theme is really about providing support to Special Needs children in mainstream schools. There are over 20,000 children with special needs attending mainstream MOE schools and these children are supported in various ways. Allied Educators provide learning and behavioural support to students with mild educational needs such as dyslexia, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). And all schools have a core group of teachers trained to support students with special needs.",
            "In addition, a number of schools in each cluster are resourced with disabled friendly facilities and programmes to support students with hearing impairments, visual impairments and physical disabilities.",
            "The third theme is Post-18 options for Special Needs children. What happens when the formal schooling ends? This is something that weighs on the minds of all parents who do have Special Needs children. We are very aware of their concerns regarding the limited options that Persons with Disabilities have after graduating from SPED schools. We are currently studying the opportunities to increase Post-18 range of options.",
            "Efforts are underway to strengthen the transition from SPED schools to work. MOE, MSF and SG Enable have started the School-to-Work (S2W) programme, which involves the schools, employers and parents to provide more work and training options for these students. And to try to further ensure as far as possible information transfer and a seamless transition from home to school and school to work and to facilitate that as much as we can.",
            "A fourth theme is about funding for skills training post SPED. My Ministry has been working with MOE for the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) to be extended to Special Needs children following their graduation from SPED for skills development and further training to enhance their work capability.",
            "Like all other Singaporeans, Persons with Disabilities will also be able to tap on SkillsFuture when they reach 25 years of age for continuing professional development training to remain relevant in the workforce. For many with special abilities, they can gain new skills and to be relevant in the workforce. And I think we are making some progress on that front and I hope that we can extend that as much as possible. For many companies and certainly for some sectors, we do not know what we do not know. When we actually look at how it is being done elsewhere, sometimes abroad or sometimes in other industries, it surprises employers. \"I did not realise that I can do that.\" And when that realisation happens, that opens a pathway for many other options to be developed.",
            "A fifth theme is about training and employment in general. Employment is an important platform to helping Persons with Disabilities gain independence and SG Enable was set up in 2013 precisely to also promote the employment of Persons with Disabilities. Persons with Disabilities seeking employment assistance and training courses that will help increase their employability can approach SG Enable – and please do so. Persons with Disabilities can benefit from the job-readiness assessment conducted by specialists, job placement and job support. SG Enable actively engages employers and seeks to encourage them to make employment opportunities available for Persons with Disabilities.",
            "Sixth, it is important in terms of care services, especially for caregivers. We are also mindful of the rising number of adults with autism and the need for the services have to be expanded to meet the demand. Our Ministry will be expanding the range of home and community care options to meet the needs of the various groups. We are currently on track to add over more than 200 more day care places by 2018 for Day Activity Centres specifically catering to persons with Autism. As we expand the capacity of our services, we are also mindful of the quality and capability of staff rendering these services.",
            "MSF will continue to assess the training needs of staff working with Persons with Disabilities, and work on the professional development of the staff with relevant training agencies and experts in the field. VWOs also share best practices and knowledge with each other, and also hear from experts from relevant fields of practice at networking platforms organised by MSF and NCSS.",
            "In addition, we are exploring with VWOs to enable day activity centres programming in the community with the help of volunteers. Meaning that we do not need to have centre activities at the Day Activity Centre itself but that there are other ways in which we can carry that out. A lot of it is providing knowledge especially to families because if they feel they are relatively inadequate and the only way to provide some of the support is to send their children to the Day Activity Centres, but they do not realise that there are things that you can do at home or within the community.",
            "These activities will enable the community to support Persons with Disabilities and their families living in their neighbourhood, and in many ways, like an extended family, or an extended Day Activity Centre, if you will. The community at large can certainly play a bigger role in lending their support for such initiatives, firstly, by acceptance, and secondly, to reach out to these groups. This may be a small step for the community but I think it is a very significant step forward in our effort to build an inclusive society. We will continue to press ahead with the expansion of capacity and relevant services so that Persons with Disabilities can be better served.",
            "I agree with Mr Murali in terms of the waiting times, not just for Day Activity Centres, but for various Special Needs schools and so on. In some cases, the wait is longer than we desire. If I were a parent of a Special Needs child, and especially where we believe that early intervention will make a difference, it is very anxious – every month that we wait. We wish that if intervention had come earlier, it would have made that additional amount of difference. We will endeavour to bring those timings down.",
            "In terms of subsidies for care services and transportation, caregivers who are accessing care services, such as Day Activity Centres, Home-based care services and the Drop-in Disability Programme, it is also important for us to support the effort to get there. So, they receive continued support from Government through means-tested subsidies which can defray up to 80% of their costs. Also, Persons with Disabilities who are accessing educational or care services can tap on dedicated transport. For example, SPED schools, are also supported through transport assistance under the VWO Transport Subsidy Scheme. Eligible Persons with Disabilities may receive transport subsidies of up to 80% of their monthly transport fares. In addition, Persons with Disabilities receive 25% concession on fares on public transport.",
            "In terms of schemes and support for caregivers, caregivers are supported through both subsidy schemes to defray the cost of services as well as through care-giver support centres at the Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) and within SPED schools. Caregivers who require the assistance of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) to care for Persons with Disabilities with their activities of daily living are eligible to pay a lower monthly FDW Levy. Families whose monthly per capita income is less than $2,600 are supported through a monthly FDW Grant to offset the cost of a foreign domestic worker. Caregivers can also enhance their care skills with the support of the Caregivers' Training Grant.",
            "The last theme is about supporting the Persons with Disabilities beyond the caregivers' lifetime.",
            "Many parents are anxious as to what is going to happen after they have passed on. One of the things I would very much urge parents to do is to also involve the rest of the family. Sometimes, I do notice that parents, rather than wanting to burden the siblings, take on the responsibility themselves, but I think it is important to involve the siblings in the process because when they pass on, it is not always a given that the siblings necessarily will step forward and play their role. I think that this is something that is important.",
            "But beyond that, what can we do to support parents and to assure them? To address this concern, the Special Needs Trust Company (SNTC) was set up in 2008 to provide trust management services for families of Persons with Disabilities. SNTC provides an avenue for caregivers to plan for the long-term financial and care needs of Persons with Disabilities. Along with SNTC, we set up the Special Needs Saving Scheme which was established in 2012 to enable parents to set aside CPF savings for the long-term care of their Children with Disabilities. We will continue to explore avenues to further help address the concerns of caregivers in these matters. So, please do continue to provide us feedback from the families who have concerns on this front.",
            "I would like to conclude by saying that, indeed, while much work has been done – I think credit to those in the sector who have been actively pushing for these issues to improve – while much work has been done to help the caregivers and Persons with Disabilities, very clearly, there is still room for improvement. As we work through the next Enabling Masterplan, we hope to address the various concerns faced by the caregivers of Persons with Disabilities and build on what we have done.",
            "What I have mentioned is but a brief overview of some of the areas that we are currently working on. The Enabling Masterplan aims to examine these issues, and we will provide an update when the Enabling Masterplan recommendations are ready.",
            "With the support and partnership of the people, private and public sectors, we can altogether build a more inclusive society in Singapore in time to come.",

            "About 98% of the residential fires this year are small-scale fires which did not result in casualties. About 50% of these fires were caused by the indiscriminate disposal of lighted materials, such as lighted cigarettes and charcoal embers, down the rubbish chute or into rubbish bins at common areas. Unattended cooking, which accounted for about 20% of the recent residential fires, is the second main cause.",
            "A large number of residential fires can therefore be prevented with better awareness of fire safety at home. To increase awareness, the SCDF actively promotes fire safety and public education messages through community-based programmes and initiatives. Residents participate in fire drills at Emergency Preparedness Day Events, and learn emergency preparedness skills such as operating a fire extinguisher when they take part in the Community Emergency Preparedness Programme. The SCDF also disseminates fire safety advisories to homes, and regularly collaborates with grassroots organisations to include articles on fire hazards and fire safety tips in their newsletters and magazines.",
            "The SCDF does not monitor the percentage of homes that currently own a fire extinguisher. Fire extinguishers are sold by private vendors who are not required to report their sales to the SCDF. However, the SCDF encourages each household to be equipped with a fire extinguisher to be prepared for fire emergencies. This message is regularly emphasised through SCDF's community-based initiatives as well as in fire safety advisories."

If the operators fail to deploy the bus bridging services adequately or appropriately, they may be penalised.",

It takes almost 20 buses to carry the load of one train. Hence, the only satisfactory way forward is to improve the reliability of our train system, reduce frequency of disruptions, avoid large scale disruptions, speed up fault identification and train service recovery. For the longer term, we have to increase the resilience of our train network by building another orbital line like the Cross Island Line. This will create multiple interchanges with our existing lines, and provide commuters with more alternative rail routes in the event of any service disruption."

Since the Taxi Availability standards were introduced, the proportion of two-shift taxis has increased from 53% to 68%. The proportion of the taxi fleet plying the roads during peak hours has gone up, from 82% to 92%. This has made it easier for commuters to get a taxi by street hail.

            "In the first half of 2016, there are already 42 fatalities, 12 more compared to the same period last year",
            "1",
            ". Construction sector remains the top contributor with 18 fatalities. This is an 80% increase from last year, where we had 10 from the construction sector.",
            "Our preliminary investigations findings indicate that the fatalities had multiple factors as root causes. Many cases were due to inadequate risk assessments carried out by the companies, lack of planning and coordination, and insufficient safety awareness among the workers. On the whole, it points to an absence of a robust WSH management system in the companies involved.",
            "MOM has earlier outlined a four-pronged strategy to take targeted interventions to improve WSH raising awareness, building WSH capability, strengthening enforcement and imposing harsher penalties. Stiffer penalties against errant companies which flout safety regulations were introduced in May. Since then",
            "2",
            ", 25 extended Stop Work Orders were issued against worksites with rampant unsafe conditions. We have also stepped up our enforcement presence, targeting high-risk sectors undertaking activities with high incidences of work injuries such as work at height, crane operations and formwork structures.",
            "This heightened regulatory stance by MOM is complemented with stepped up assistance provided by the WSH Council. The Safety Compliance Assistance Visits Plus (SCAV+) programme was launched in June to help companies identify WSH lapses and improve risk assessment capabilities. This supplements existing WSH capability and culture building efforts, such as the WSH Council's bizSAFE and CultureSAFE programmes. The Council also produced a series of pictograms showing WSH Dos and Don'ts of common work situations. These are being distributed to construction sites and foreign worker dormitories as visual reminders to increase the safety consciousness of our workers.",
            "We are heartened that the industry also stepped up efforts to increase WSH awareness. In April, more than 100 project sites in the construction and marine sectors participated in a Safety Time Out to review the safety procedures for their work activities. Last month, over 70 worksites participated in safety awareness activities involving CEOs of the Singapore Contractors Association (SCAL) member companies. This is important to demonstrate leadership commitment to WSH. SCAL also collaborated with the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) and the WSH Council to develop more user-friendly WSH training materials for construction workers.",
            "At a structural level, the Design for Safety (DfS) Regulations will come into effect on 1 August 2016. Under the Regulations, developers and designers will have responsibility for the safety and health of workers in the construction sector. The Regulations will foster greater industry ownership and facilitate information sharing among all stakeholders to improve the identification and management of WSH risks throughout all phases of the building project.",
            "It is important to reiterate that WSH is ultimately everyone's responsibility. All stakeholders – employers, supervisors and workers – must take proactive ownership in WSH in order to improve our situation. MOM will continue to work closely with the WSH Council and industry partners to raise WSH standards and foster safe work habits."

            "The Employment Act draws this distinction primarily for Part IV of the Act, which relates to hours of work, rest days and annual leave. This is to take into account the differences in the nature of work between workmen and non-workmen. Our longer term intent is to remove this demarcation given the changing nature of our workforce.",
            "For example, we have already taken steps to reduce the difference in coverage between these two groups. In the 2014 amendments to the Employment Act, we raised the salary threshold of non-workmen for Part IV coverage from $2,000 to $2,500 while holding the salary threshold of workmen constant at $4,500. This is to allow the salary threshold of non-workmen to catch up gradually with workmen, while balancing employers’ concerns about rise in business costs.",
            "Whether a worker is classified as a workman, a non-workman or a manager or executive depends on the specific nature of his work. The Employment Act clarifies that a worker with supervisory duties who actually does manual work for more than 50% of the time is considered a workman. However, this does not apply to any person who is employed in a managerial or executive position as specified in the Employment Act. The work-hour related provisions in Part IV of the Employment Act are less relevant to managers and executives whose jobs are often more outcomes based.",
            "That said, managers and executives enjoy protections under other parts of the Employment Act. In fact, we have progressively enhanced protections for managers and executives in our employment laws over the years. For example, we amended the Employment Act in 2008 to extend salary protection to managers and executives earning less than $2,500 a month, including access to the Labour Court to resolve salary-related disputes. This salary ceiling was raised to $4,500 in 2011 to cover a bigger group of managers and executives. In 2014, we again amended the Employment Act to cover managers and executives for non-salary issues such as sick leave benefits and protection against unfair dismissal. We have also amended our Industrial Relations Act to allow managers and executives more options for union representation at the workplace, most recently in 2015.",
            "In addition, MOM is now working with the State Courts to set up the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) early next year. The ECT will allow all managers and executives who now have no access to the Labour Court with a new, quick and expeditious channel to resolve statutory and contractual salary-related disputes, subject to certain claims limits.",
            "Managers and executives form an important and growing part of our workforce. MOM, together with our tripartite partners, will continue to regularly review our employment laws to ensure that they are adequately protected."

Under the Parliamentary Elections Act, election advertising is not allowed on Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day. This is to allow voters time to step back from the excitement and emotion of the campaign, and reflect on the issues at stake before casting their votes.",

It is therefore not possible for the Elections Department to monitor every single post in enforcing the prohibition against election advertising on Cooling-Off and Polling days. Instead, the Elections Department takes a practical approach, by taking into account the following factors",
            "a. Intent. Posts clearly intending to promote or procure electoral success of a political party or candidate, or enhance their standing, are not allowed. For example, a post that asks people to \"vote Party A\" is quite clearly intended to secure the electoral success of Party A. A post that portrays \"Party B\" negatively is also considered election advertising as it is likely to enhance the standing of Party A. In addition, repeated publication of posts on Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day, or posts published after ELD had issued its reminder, will be treated more seriously.",
            "b. Reach and impact. ELD will consider how many people are likely to have read particular posts. Posts by individuals or groups that regularly engage in the discussion of political issues will have further reach and greater impact than those by ordinary members of the public.",
            "As for the Member's second question, the law does allow for individual-to-individual transmission of personal political views, on a non-commercial basis, on Cooling-Off Day and Polling Day. So if a person sends an email or SMS to a friend to share his personal political views about the election, that will not be considered a breach. However, if he blogs or posts a message on his Facebook page that everyone can read, asking readers to vote for a particular party or candidate, that is clearly publication of election advertising."

            ": The use of Price-Quality Method, where procurement decisions are made based on a combination of both \"Price\" and \"Quality\" factors, has been in practice in the Public Service for many years. However, its adoption and the weightage of the \"Quality\" factors used vary from procurement to procurement depending on the context of each procurement. For example, the evaluation criteria for cleaning services for office premises will be different from those required for street and expressway cleaning. In fact, the need to cater to the different context of the procurement was also acknowledged in the Best Sourcing Practices Advisory published by the Tripartite Committee for Low-Wage Workers and Inclusive Growth (TriCom), where it was noted that while buyers \"should aim towards achieving a weightage of 30:70 between Price and Quality criteria respectively… the weightage may be adjusted based on the needs of your organisation\".",
            "For tenders called in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors, \"Quality\" factors were considered in the award of all the tenders called in 2015 and 2016. For these tenders, where weightages were explicitly specified, the \"Quality\" component made up 20% to 70% of the total evaluation criteria.",
            "We agree that security, cleaning and landscape services should not be procured based on price alone, and we are further reviewing the emphasis placed on \"Quality\" factors in the evaluation of these tenders. However, even as the TriCom recommended that buyers should aim towards achieving a 3070 Price-Quality weightage, it also recognised that there is no ideal price-quality weightage that is suitable for all situations. What goes into the \"Quality\" component must be relevant to the tenderers' ability to provide the required service. If we simply set 70% as the weightage for \"Quality\" factors, but they do not allow us to differentiate the ability of the tenderers to provide the cleaning, security or landscape services, then the tenderers may end up being assessed with the same \"Quality\" scores, and it will still end up with competition based on price.",
            "We share Mr Zainal Sapari's interest in uplifting the cleaning, security and landscape sectors, and in improving the working conditions of the workers. To achieve these objectives in a sustainable manner, the Government has supported the adoption of the Progressive Wage Model which the tripartite partners have agreed to. We had taken the lead to procure only from cleaning service providers who adopt the wage model, even before it became a licensing requirement.",
            "We have also taken onboard feedback to use less prescriptive and less headcount-based tenders. As mentioned at the Ministry of Finance Committee of Supply response earlier this year, we are now working with respective lead agencies and industry to progressively introduce outcome-based procurement in the cleaning, security and landscape sectors over time. This would allow tenderers to consider using technology and innovative solutions. Along with this, we will also increase the emphasis and weightage placed on the \"Quality\" factors which reflect the tenderers' ability to provide the service, such as manpower productivity of the tenderers and the quality of their workforce."

The decision to schedule the mid-year examinations for JC students in Term 3 after the June vacation will allow the students to better manage their revision and to ensure they would still have some time in the June vacation to have a break and pursue other recreational and social activities.",
            "Similarly, a small proportion of schools at other levels may also conduct some form of testing after the June holidays for their students in graduating levels, to help them consolidate their learning in June and pace their revision leading up to national examinations.",
            "Our schools are mindful of the need to strike a balance between catering to students' academic and CCA needs as well as their socio-emotional well-being. The decision to have examinations after the vacation is made after considering the different options available to address their students' overall needs and also to minimise stress."

            ": A car-lite society needs to be underpinned by a good public transport system which makes it unnecessary for people to own cars. To this end, we have made significant improvements in our rail and bus services. Our rail network is being built up at an unprecedented pace, and will double to 360 km by 2030. Since 2012, we have expanded our train fleet by 50%, and our bus fleet by 25%. As a result, train and bus rides are now less crowded, more comfortable and convenient, with shorter waiting and travelling times. We are also working hard to improve the reliability of our rail system. We are making steady progress, but there is still room for improvement.",
            "We have also taken significant steps to improve the first- and last-mile connection between homes and transport hubs. We have built 17 km of sheltered walkways and 57 km of cycling paths. We aim to build about 150 km more sheltered walkways under our Walk2Ride programme by 2018 and about 130km more cycling paths by 2020. Just this past weekend, PM graced the launch of Phase One of Ang Mo Kio Walking and Cycling Town, which we hope can be a model for all towns in the future. Earlier this year, the Government accepted the Active Mobility Advisory Panel's recommendations on cycling and the use of personal mobility devices. Greater certainty on the rules and norms will encourage more people to cycle for short commutes.",
            "Despite our investments in public transport and active mobility, we recognize that sometimes, it may still be more convenient for commuters to take personalised, point-to-point transport. We have taken some steps to enhance taxi and private hire car services. Recently, LTA signed a partnership with one of Europe’s largest car-sharing operator to implement an electric vehicle car sharing programme in Singapore, which will see 1,000 shared cars on our roads within 10 years.",
            "Private cars will continue to have a role in our car-lite society. However, it is important that the cost of driving, particularly the land-take for roads and parking, be accurately reflected. The increase in car park charges by HDB and URA has this in mind. Our public parking rates have remained unchanged for more than 10 years, while the cost of building, operating and managing car parks has increased by 40%. Even after the increase, our public parking rates remain lower compared to other global cities such as London, New York and Tokyo. In due course, we will also review car parking provisions for buildings and developments.",
            "MAS has explained that the car loan restrictions introduced in 2013 was a cyclical response to reduce inflationary pressures and over-borrowing from the strong demand for cars. As inflationary pressures and have receded and outstanding motor vehicle loans have declined, MAS has reset the car loan restrictions to levels more appropriate for the longer term. This reset does not affect our move to a car-lite society. We would still want to see a reduction in the growth of the car population, and will be reviewing the vehicle growth rate next year."

Tax incentives were also introduced in 2004 and 2008 to encourage provision of additional portable medical benefits on a voluntary basis at the company level.",

Our last survey in 2013 showed that about 4% of companies employing about 20% of our local workers have done so. Even with the tax incentives, many employers prefer to continue with their own non-portable medical benefits which are more cost-effective in attracting and retaining workers who are mostly healthy adults of working age.",

With MediShield Life, all our local workers can be assured that their medical coverage, including for pre-existing illnesses, would follow them regardless of any change in employment status or employer. More importantly, the annual claim limit has been raised significantly, and the lifetime claim limit has been removed.",
            "These enhancements have given greater assurance to workers and added impetus to tripartite efforts to encourage the voluntary adoption of portable medical benefits by companies. Of the various portable medical benefits options, our focus going forward will be to encourage employers to make additional contributions to employees' Medisave accounts. We have started by including this in the Tripartite Guidelines on Re-employment of Older Employees released in May 2016. The tripartite partners will continue to work closely to encourage more employers to offer voluntary portable medical benefits at the company level."

As a key financial, transportation and trading hub in the region, Singapore is well-positioned to be a base for Chinese enterprises venturing into Southeast Asia. In 2015, Chinese investments into Singapore amounted to US$4.96 billion, an increase of 76.5% from the previous year. To date, more than 6,500 Chinese companies have established their presence in Singapore, almost twice the number of companies five years ago. Singapore companies can benefit from collaboration opportunities with this growing pool of Chinese companies venturing into the region, in sectors such as transport and logistics, mixed-use park developments, construction materials and financing.",

Various provinces in China have rolled out infrastructure and development plans to support the initiative, resulting in greater opportunities for Singapore companies in sectors such as information and communications technology (ICT), urban solutions, transport and logistics, as well as infrastructure and related services. A key example of this is the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI), the third Government-to-Government project between Singapore and China. Under this initiative, Singapore companies can access opportunities and bring on board our expertise in the areas of financial services, aviation, transport & logistics and ICT.",

In 2015, IE Singapore supported 34,000 companies in their internationalisation efforts and over 80% of these companies were SMEs.",

In particular, the Government recently enhanced the Child Development Account (or CDA) by introducing the CDA First Step, which provides the first $3,000 of Government contributions, without parents having to save first. CDA funds can be used to pay for education and healthcare needs of the child, including childcare fees.",

            "First, centres under the Anchor Operator and Partner Operator schemes are subject to fee caps. Today, over 40% of Singaporean children enrolled in childcare are in these centres, which is a significant increase from about 20% in 2012.",
            "Second, through basic and means-tested childcare subsidies which were enhanced in 2013. This allows lower-income families to pay as little as $3 per month. Parents can also use money in their CDAs to pay for the balance of the fees.",
            "Through these enhancements, we have significantly increased government spending on early childhood. We spent about $600 million on pre-school related efforts last year, which is more than one and a half times of what we spent in 2012.",
            "This approach keeps childcare affordable, while allowing parents to choose from a variety of options according to their preferences. Conversely, provision of free childcare may limit the range of childcare programmes available to parents, and result in a higher burden to taxpayers. It may also have the unintended consequence of driving over-consumption and hence raising demand, so parents truly in need of childcare might find it difficult to secure a place.",

Several also cited reasons like financial difficulty or divorce. While we empathise with these cases, they do not provide sufficient grounds to justify the waiver of the ethnic limits, which are needed to ensure a good mix of residents in our neighbourhoods and public housing estates.

            ": Currently, when the lease for a wet market and hawker centre expires, stall-owners who wish to continue their businesses will have the option to do so. Those previously on the subsidised scheme will pay the current subsidised rent while those who were not previously subsidised can either pay the prevailing market rent or tender for vacant stalls. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been studying alternative management models for hawker centres and will consider where it can be applied so long as the fundamental objective of hawker centres in providing affordable, hygienic food is maintained.",
            "Just like other sold centres whose leases had expired earlier, the wet market and hawker centre at Block 511, Bedok North Street 3 will continue to operate after the stall leases expire on 31 October 2017. The Town Council remains responsible for the maintenance of this centre and must arrange for any necessary repairs and redecorations (R&R) to be done."

There are learning support programmes to help these students acquire the basic literacy and numeracy skills. Support in these programmes is extended all the way to secondary school levels if the child needs it.",
            "In addition, students with dyslexia may attend the School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) Programme or the MOE-aided literacy remediation at the Dyslexia Association of Singapore. MOE also provides resources for parents to support their children with dyslexia on the MOE Social Media Platforms such as Schoolbag.sg. Students with learning difficulties may also be referred to MOE Psychologists for further assessment and consultation on follow-up support.",
            "There are also trained personnel such as Teachers trained in Special Needs, Allied Educators for Learning and Behavioural Support, and School Counsellors to provide case consultation and intervention for students with learning disabilities such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or mild Autism Spectrum Disorder. MOE also collaborates with the Institute of Mental Health to make available the REACH (Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community mental Health) services where students can be assessed for further support and intervention including advice for parents and caregivers."

Results for UniSIM will be available in 2018 when its first batch of full-time students graduates.",
            "Instead of having one comprehensive survey for all AUs, each AU conducts its own survey, with MOE standardising the methodology. That way, students have access to more information, on the full-time permanent employment rates and monthly salaries for graduates from each degree programme from each university, and can make better-informed decisions when choosing their course of study.",
            "The Council for Private Education (CPE) has commissioned a pilot graduate employment survey for graduates from Private Education Institutions (PEIs). The pilot survey polled graduates from nine of the largest PEIs, which covered the majority of private degree graduates in 2014. As mentioned in Parliament on 28 January 2016, CPE will make available information from this survey, to help support individuals in their decision making.",
