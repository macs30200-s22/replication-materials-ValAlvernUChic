            ":",
            "In January 2016, shortly after the SG50 year, my predecessor President Tony Tan opened the 13th Parliament. Dr Tan reviewed how far we had come as a nation. He renewed our commitment to keep Singapore an exceptional nation, with a thriving economy and a caring and inclusive society.",
            "We are now midway through the current term of Government. It has been an eventful 32 months: the United States elected a new President; the Chinese Communist Party held its 19th National Congress; the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union; and ISIS became a significant menace, though it has since been dealt a severe blow.",
            "Singapore has navigated a steady path amidst an uncertain external environment. We deepened our engagement with neighbours, as well as major global powers. We advocated for free trade against rising protectionism, and helped to conclude the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. We continued to uphold ASEAN centrality and unity.",
            "We have done well at home too. The economy recorded steady growth, especially in 2017, which we hope will extend into 2018. Real wages rose steadily for all income groups. We are making progress in renewing our economy. The Government, industries and unions are partnering one another to implement the recommendations of the Committee on the Future Economy.",
            "We upgraded and extended our infrastructure. We opened Changi Terminal 4, launched 46,000 new BTO units, completed the addition of 1,000 more buses and opened new MRT lines. We sped up the upgrading of the North-South and East-West MRT lines. We are improving the reliability of our trains.",
            "We continued to strive for a more caring and inclusive society. We strengthened education at all levels – from pre-school for toddlers to lifelong learning opportunities for all ages. We enhanced social safety nets and provided more support for the vulnerable – from KidSTART for at-risk young children to Silver Support for seniors who had earned low incomes.",
            "The Singapore spirit shone bright. We rejoiced when Joseph Schooling won Singapore’s first Olympic gold medal, and when Yip Pin Xiu and Theresa Goh triumphed at the Rio Paralympics. We celebrated NS50 and saluted over a million national servicemen who have served their nation through the decades. The National Gallery opened to the public, including a permanent exhibition of the unique Nanyang style of painting.",
            "We amended the Constitution to reflect our multi-racial values, by ensuring that all ethnic groups have a chance to be represented in the highest office in the land. I am honoured to serve as the first Malay President in 47 years after Encik Yusof Ishak. I renew today the pledge that I made when I took my oath of office in September last year: I will serve every Singaporean, regardless of race, language or religion.",
            "This year's Budget was a far-reaching one. We had to take some difficult decisions. These steps were necessary to strengthen our long-term fiscal position, ready us for an ageing population, and fund infrastructure investments on a sustainable basis. As your President, I will safeguard our reserves and ensure that they are drawn upon properly and only under exceptional circumstances, or for other very good reasons.",
            "Our island-nation is doing well. The Government is fulfilling the tasks it set out to accomplish; relations with partners around the world are good; people live harmoniously with one another; and economic prospects are bright.",
            "But do not assume that Singapore will always continue to be successful. There are significant developments in our external and domestic environments that we must understand and deal with.",
            "First, strategic changes. The centre of gravity of the world economy is shifting to Asia, as a result of China rising and India taking off. ASEAN, our immediate neighbourhood, is generating renewed interest among international investors. These trends bode well for Singapore.",
            "But much depends on the relationship between the US and China, which underpins regional and global peace and prosperity. Both powers have high stakes in maintaining a stable and healthy relationship. However, their relationship is a dynamic one. As China’s strength grows and America’s interests evolve, both sides will need to manage the inevitable rivalries and disagreements, and exercise foresight and restraint. Trade frictions are just one aspect of US-China bilateral tensions that affect the rest of the world – especially small, open economies like ours.",
            "Second, regional tensions. The Korean Peninsula is currently seeing fresh and positive developments, but it is a complex problem with a long history. Negotiations towards a peaceful resolution and ultimately, the denuclearisation of the Peninsula, will be complex and difficult.",
            "Terrorism remains a clear and present danger. ISIS has lost the military battle in Iraq and Syria, but the extremist ideology behind it has not been eradicated. Southeast Asian fighters who joined ISIS in the Middle East may return home to mount attacks in and around their home countries. Singapore is a target. We must stay vigilant and united, and never allow a terrorist attack to cause discord and distrust among us. In particular, we must be careful of the dangers of online radicalisation.",
            "Closer to home, relations with our immediate neighbours – Malaysia and Indonesia – are stable and multi-faceted. Our histories and heritages are intertwined. We have grown our partnerships in recent years, and will continue to strengthen them. We must tend these bilateral relationships carefully, especially during election seasons, and avoid becoming embroiled in their domestic politics.",
            "Third, domestic developments. The texture of our society is changing as our population ages. This will place heavier demands on our healthcare and social security systems.",
            "We have seen income inequality and social stratification break the social compact in many countries. If the same happens to us, our politics will turn vicious, our society will fracture and our nation will wither. We must tackle inequality, particularly the increasingly dissimilar starting points of children from different family backgrounds, before the problem becomes entrenched in our society.",
            "Religious polarisation, xenophobia and extreme nationalism are also divisive forces that have grown stronger in many parts of the world. The cyber space is being used to spread falsehoods and misinformation, and to sow distrust within societies. We must not allow our nation to succumb to these forces.",
            "All these developments that I have outlined can affect us in unexpected ways. We need to watch them closely, tackle them resolutely, and make progress together. We already have policies and programmes to respond to these shifts. These tasks will occupy us beyond this term of Government.",
            "In the meantime, the fourth generation leadership team is taking shape, and taking on more responsibilities. They will have to confront the question, \"What is next for Singapore?\"",
            "Like their predecessors, the fourth generation leaders will uphold our foundational values – multi-racialism, meritocracy, incorruptibility, self-reliance, inclusivity and openness to the world. They recognise the constants of Singapore's existence. A small, multi-cultural city-state, with no natural resources, in the heart of Southeast Asia, must survive and thrive on the wits and will of its people.",
            "At the same time, the new leaders are conscious that Singapore is at quite an advanced stage of development. We may feel that we have more to lose now. We may be tempted not to go for bold changes, but instead be content to tweak things at the margins.",
            "That would be the wrong approach. Singapore has a lot going for it. It is a vibrant global node in the heart of a thriving Asia; a multi-cultural society with people from diverse backgrounds living harmoniously side by side. We need to keep alive the spirit of our pioneers and be constantly driven to do better, with each generation surpassing the previous.",
            "The fourth generation leaders will work with fellow Singaporeans to undertake the next phase of nation building. Together, they will build upon what earlier generations accomplished. They will fashion new ideas and fresh approaches to confront a different future.",
            "We are beginning to see the imprint of the new leadership in developing and implementing public policies. Over time, these policies will be elaborated, refined, and will produce results. The work has begun, and will intensify from the second half of this term of Government. Let me outline the key priorities.",
            "First, we want to secure Singapore's place in this changing world. To do so, we are prepared to stand and fight for our nation, defend our vital interests, and work with others in win-win partnerships.",
            "The Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team are steadily building up their capabilities, including against unconventional threats like terrorism and cyber-attacks. Beyond equipment and capabilities, our strength ultimately lies in our people's resolve to defend this country and be masters of our destiny.",
            "As a small globalised city, we must uphold international law and the role of supra-national institutions. Against the tide of rising protectionism, we must champion free trade, and explore new opportunities to collaborate with others.",
            "We seek to be friends with as many countries as possible. In particular, we will work for good relations with both the US and China.",
            "The US has been a constructive and stabilising presence in the region for the past 70 years. It remains an important strategic partner for Singapore. We cooperate with the US in many areas, and will enhance this cooperation in the years ahead.",
            "Our relationship with China is deep and productive. Through China's four decades of reform and opening up, generations of leaders in both countries have worked closely together. We will continue to collaborate with China in its next phase of development, including participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.",
            "In Southeast Asia, we will strive for an open and inclusive regional order, with all the major powers engaged. We will work with regional partners to strengthen ASEAN centrality and unity, and do our part to prevent the build-up of tensions in the South China Sea. This year, we are the ASEAN chair, but we will sustain our efforts for the long term.",
            "Second, Singaporeans want to live in a world-class city and an endearing home – clean, green and efficient; fun and connected; and we are prepared to think long term in planning our city and infrastructure, and building for future generations.",
            "We will invest in infrastructure to keep Singapore one of the best connected cities in Asia, a hub and conduit for the flow of goods and services, capital and people, information and knowledge. We are building Changi Airport Terminal 5 and a new Tuas Port. The Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail and the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link will open up business opportunities and draw our two peoples closer. Beyond physical links, we will also develop Singapore as a node in the global flow of data.",
            "We are renewing our HDB heartlands and investing heavily in new MRT infrastructure. Sustainable development will be a key consideration. We are making this a car-lite city, with vibrant public spaces and pathways for walking and cycling. We are working with Singaporeans to create a greener and better living environment, a City in a Garden. We will do our part to reduce carbon emissions.",
            "A far-reaching transformation of Singapore's cityscape will take shape in the coming decades. When Paya Lebar Air Base moves to Changi, it will free up an area larger than Ang Mo Kio for redevelopment. Moving the city ports to Tuas will double the size of the Central Business District. The possibilities in this new area – the Greater Southern Waterfront – are immense, and limited only by our imagination.",
            "With bold thinking, we will create a metropolis that embraces the future.",
            "Third, Singaporeans want our city to remain a nation of opportunities, where we can pursue dreams, chart fulfilling careers and lead meaningful lives. To achieve this, we are prepared to adapt to changing economic conditions, embrace technology, and continually upgrade our skills and knowledge.",
            "We will continue to renew the economy to keep it productive, enterprising and innovative. Our investment in Research and Development is bearing fruit, and will enable us to exploit deep technology and digitalisation; create a Smart Nation; and conceive, test-bed and scale up new products and services.",
            "This innovation ecosystem will strongly support entrepreneurship and further develop the start-up scene – in artificial intelligence, FinTech, advanced manufacturing, bio-science and other areas. New business centres, such as the Jurong Lake District, Punggol Digital District, and Woodlands North Coast, will each have its own character and industry niche.",
            "Companies will play a major role in economic restructuring. We will build a strong base of local firms with the capabilities to succeed both at home and abroad. Our enterprises must develop a strong culture of collaboration, especially when overseas. Singapore Inc. must be a force abroad as much as it is at home.",
            "Finally, we will invest heavily in our people. In an age of technological disruption, Singaporeans must be flexible, eager to learn, and adventurous to venture beyond our shores.",
            "We are changing the way we educate and prepare Singaporeans for life, putting less emphasis on academic grades, and more on skills and the ability to adapt to a dynamic external environment. SkillsFuture will anchor this national culture of lifelong learning for skills mastery. Adapt and Grow will match workers to jobs, and help them stay employable as industries and jobs change.",
            "Unions, employers and Government must continue to collaborate closely. Tripartism has been an enduring competitive advantage for Singapore, and we have to continually nurture and strengthen it.",
            "Fourth, Singaporeans want to live in a fair and just society, one based on meritocracy, but at the same time strives to leave no one behind. Thus we are each prepared to do our best, but also to walk alongside fellow citizens who need help to keep up.",
            "In Singapore, people must always be able to get ahead through effort and excellence. We must open up more progression pathways, and celebrate a broader range of successes. We are committed to give every child a good start in life, no matter what their family circumstances may be. We will continue to raise the quality of pre-schools and do more for children at risk.",
            "We must tackle inequality vigorously. We need to provide the right additional support to those needing it – in housing, education, skills training, and employment – so that meritocracy works well. Only then can everyone do well through hard work, talent and skills, regardless of their backgrounds.",
            "We need to pay special attention to the growing population of elderly. We will continue to help older workers stay employed, earn fair wages, and save more, so that they can age with dignity and purpose. We will enhance elderly friendly infrastructure, including new housing options, and healthcare and fitness facilities. We will keep healthcare affordable through well-designed healthcare subsidies, MediShield Life, MediFund and enhancements to ElderShield.",
            "The Government will do its part to meet the needs of different segments of Singaporeans. It will provide more support to young families and make Singapore a great place to have children; help families cope with the cost of living; and enable persons with disabilities to lead full and active lives.",
            "Most importantly, we need to build a strong culture where the better-off devote time, talent and resources to help the less fortunate. Only when everybody lends a helping hand, can we truly become a compassionate and caring society.",
            "Above all, Singaporeans want to feel a strong sense of nationhood. That is why we are prepared to participate in and enlarge our common space, while preserving and practising our own ethnic cultures.",
            "The public housing estates brought communities together. Through the education system, we adopted a common working language in English. National Service has become a key institution for nation building, and a major part of the Singaporean identity.",
            "By living and working side by side, going through ups and downs together, our diverse cultures and traditions are now interwoven. We did not expect this on 8 August 1965, but we have succeeded in nurturing a distinct Singapore identity, a sense of common destiny transcending our individual racial and religious identities. This is still a work in progress, but we have come far.",
            "The Singapore Bicentennial in 2019 – 200 years after Stamford Raffles landed in Singapore – will be an occasion to trace our roots, and draw inspiration for the journey ahead. We will reflect on what it means to be Singaporean, and on the common values and beliefs that bind us together.",
            "In an uncertain and volatile world, leadership will continue to make a critical difference to Singapore. In responding to the challenges of their times, the fourth generation leaders will work in concert with Singaporeans.",
            "A new generation of Singaporeans is coming of age. Their dreams, hopes and fears are different from those of their parents and grandparents.",
            "They dream of a bright future, and pour their energies into exploring fresh horizons and building a better world. They want to see their parents age well. They hope for a fairer and more equal society. As proud Singaporeans, they want to see this small island nation stand tall amongst the community of nations. Most of all, they are eager to take on responsibilities, participate in building and guiding Singapore, and step up to serve their community and country.",
            "The fourth generation leadership must fire up and mobilise the spirit and energy of young Singaporeans. They must grow with the people they represent; embrace a diversity of views and ideas; and yet forge a clarity of purpose and unity of action.",
            "Their duty is clear, but the path will not be easy. There will be times of hardship, when they must demonstrate leadership and resolve. There will be moments of truth, when they have to stand firm on principles and ideals while seeking practical resolutions. They will need to listen to the views and feelings of the people, and by their words and deeds, show that they have heard; yet never fear to lead and mobilise public opinion to support difficult policies in the long-term interest of Singapore.",
            "This is how they will earn the right to lead. That right cannot be inherited. The trust between the people and their leaders is not automatically passed on from one generation to the next. In each generation the people and leaders must work with one another, go through trials and tribulations together, and forge their own bonds afresh.",
            "After 52 years, we are not done building our nation. The struggle for independence, the journey from third world to first, are gradually fading from our lived memories, as a new generation comes to the fore. Born and raised in post-independence Singapore, they must dedicate themselves to write the next chapter of our story, understanding that becoming Singaporean – \"one united people, regardless of race, language or religion\" – continues to be an undertaking of conviction and choice.",
            "Together, the new generation will keep Singapore an exceptional nation.",
            "Adjourned accordingly at 8.57 pm."

          "speaker": "Dr Ng Eng Hen",
          "content": [
            ":  A strong Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) safeguards Singapore’s security, independence, and sovereignty. Without security and stability, we cannot achieve economic or social progress.",
            "However, the security landscape Singapore faces today is more complex. Asia’s military spending has already surpassed Europe’s since 2012. Many countries in our region are modernising their militaries against a backdrop of rising nationalism, unresolved maritime and territorial disputes, and persistent threats from terrorists and cyber-attacks. Intensifying US-China competition, uncertainties in the Korean Peninsula, greater contestation in the waters and airspace around Singapore, and the continuing threat of terrorism, can potentially disrupt the peace and stability of our region. These are the known threats, but just as potent are unexpected events that can change the status quo.",
            "The wider array of security challenges has placed more demands on the SAF, even as our manpower pool shrinks. Defence spending will also have to take into account a mature economy with slower projected growth in the future, and other needs from an ageing society and infrastructure spending. We can approach these challenges with confidence as steady investments in defence over the years have built a strong SAF that is able to deal with a broad spectrum of threats. More importantly, Singaporeans are united in their resolve and support to maintain a strong military and Total Defence.",
            "We recognise that new threat scenarios have evolved. Less advanced militaries and even non-state actors can now acquire sophisticated technologies and weaponry that used to be the domain of professional militaries. Through both physical and virtual threats in the cyberspace, attackers have more avenues to disrupt and destabilise Singapore.",
            "In response, the SAF will develop new fighting concepts and leverage technological advancements to increase our effectiveness and ensure more efficient use of manpower. For example, the Aerostat surveillance systems, Littoral Mission Vessels, and the Next-Generation Armoured Fighting Vehicles, supported by an advanced and secure communications network, have enabled the SAF to be a tightly connected and flexible military force, capable of deterring the spectrum of potential aggressors.",
            "The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the SAF are dealing directly with the regional terrorist threat, which is at an all-time high. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and ISIS-inspired groups in our region are building up military-level capabilities and firepower, augmented by the return of battle-experienced fighters from the Middle East to our region. The siege of Marawi in 2017 was a key example, which required the joint effort of the Philippines armed forces and its homeland security forces to dislodge militants from the city. The SAF will work closely with the Home Team to ensure an effective and coordinated response to any terrorist threat. Exercises such as NORTHSTAR and HIGHCREST will be stepped up in scale and complexity to build interoperability. More SAF and Singapore Police Force servicemen will undergo joint security operations training at the SAF’s Island Defence Training Institute. We are also working with other countries under a “Resilience, Response, Recovery” framework to strengthen our responses to prevent, deal with, and recover from terrorist attacks in the region.",
            "MINDEF will strengthen our cyber defence through the newly established Defence Cyber Organisation and SAF Cyber Defence Group. As with kinetic defences, the SAF will train and use qualified Full-Time National Servicemen (NSFs) and also grow its partnerships with local Institutes of Higher Learning to build a strong and capable cyber defence force.",
            "In 2017, Singapore celebrated the 50th anniversary of NS and showed its overwhelming support for this vital strategic institution that ensures our survival. MINDEF and the SAF will not take this support for granted. Instead, we will redouble our efforts to optimise the experience, contributions, and potential of our national servicemen. By making use of technology, the SAF has reduced the physical demands of selected NS vocations, such as Security Troopers, allowing more servicemen to be deployed to vocations that they were previously ineligible for. MINDEF will also continue to take into consideration the interests of NSFs when assigning their vocations. This approach has allowed for more effective and meaningful deployment of our servicemen, and encourages them to take greater ownership of their NS roles and responsibilities.",
            "Singapore will continue to work closely with our neighbours and regional partners to enhance regional stability and address common security challenges. As the Chairman of the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM) and ADMM-Plus",
            "1",
            "in 2018, we aim to: (a) enhance regional counter-terrorism cooperation; (b) improve the region’s capability to respond to chemical, biological, and radiological threats from terrorist groups and rogue actors; and (c) develop practical confidence-building measures and codes for unplanned encounters in the aviation and maritime domains, to reduce the risk of miscalculation and de-escalate tensions in the region.",
            "The ADMM was inaugurated in 2006. It is the highest defence consultative and cooperative mechanism in ASEAN. The ADMM-Plus was inaugurated in 2010, and includes the ten ASEAN Member States and eight Plus countries, namely Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Russia, and the United States.",
            "As a small city-state, it is vital to shape an open and inclusive regional security architecture where the interests of all countries are protected. Platforms such as the Shangri-La Dialogue, the ADMM-Plus Experts’ Working Groups, as well as the Five Power Defence Arrangements all help to promote multilateralism and inclusiveness. The SAF also contributes to international efforts to deal with trans-national threats.",
            "Bilaterally, MINDEF has deepened relations with defence partners through initiatives such as a new naval exercise with the US Navy and a new Naval Bilateral Agreement with India. Cooperation with Australia is progressing steadily as we commence construction of facilities to support more SAF troops to train in Queensland in 2019. We will strengthen our ties with China, and deepen military-to-military ties between the SAF and the People’s Liberation Army. The SAF will also seek out more opportunities to train with the armed forces of Malaysia and Indonesia, to build stronger trust and people-to-people ties.",
            "Ultimately, Singaporeans are responsible for our own defence. Our strongest weapon against external forces is our unity and resolve to protect our way of life and keep Singapore independent and sovereign. No amount of tanks, planes, or ships – no matter how sophisticated the systems we build – can make up for a divided nation. In this new era, where hybrid warfare can be waged first through cyberspace before any physical means, potential aggressors will seek to turn one Singaporean against the other to weaken our social compact. More than ever, Total Defence is needed and every Singaporean has to play his or her part to safeguard Singapore. Only together, can we continue to keep Singapore safe and secure for another generation."

            ":  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will strive to deliver our mission of ensuring Singapore’s safety and security, by transforming the Home Team for greater operational readiness and effectiveness, and strengthening our engagement with the community and international partners.",
            "The security environment remains complex.",
            "The terrorism threat to Singapore continues to be at a high level. We will continue to strengthen our counter-terrorism capabilities.",
            "Criminal syndicates exploit technology and the Internet, and operate across national boundaries. Online scams and online trafficking of drugs have become more prevalent. Our society has also been impacted by the worsening global drug situation, with new psychoactive substances emerging, and some countries adopting a more liberal approach towards drugs.",
            "We need to guard against attempts by foreign parties to exploit fault lines in our society and influence developments in Singapore to advance their own agenda. It is for Singaporeans to decide on our domestic politics and policies. We must defend our sovereign right to make choices for ourselves.",
            "Our racial and religious harmony has been a pillar of our peace, prosperity and progress. We must defend this vigorously, reject unequivocally teachings and practices that would divide us, and instead take active steps to grow our common space.",
            "The Home Team will have to deal with these security challenges even as we grapple with manpower constraints.",
            "We will take bold and transformative steps to develop stronger capabilities, leverage emerging technology for operations, deepen the proficiencies of our officers, and strengthen laws where necessary to enhance the Home Team’s effectiveness.",
            "The Home Team's joint capabilities will span the areas of operations, investigation, and intelligence. The new Home Team Operations Centre will be a nerve centre which will employ cutting-edge technologies and harness data, to ensure a swift and coordinated Home Team response to incidents. We will further integrate our island-wide network of cameras and sensors to enhance sense-making, and enable us to identify and deal effectively with security threats and criminal activities.",
            "We will make a strong push in digital transformation and robotics. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) will continue to integrate robotics – such as the use of exo-skeletons – into its operations, to improve the safety and capabilities of our fire-fighters. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will employ more biometric solutions to tighten border security, but will also facilitate more efficient immigration clearance through the use of automated clearance for cars. The Police investigation process will be digitalised, while the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will trial the use of automation for urine testing. The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) will use business intelligence tools to automate routine work, and video analytics to enhance supervision of inmates. These initiatives will free up our officers’ time, allowing them to perform more complex and higher value-added tasks, and improve their productivity and effectiveness.",
            "We will continue to invest heavily in our people. Home Team officers will have more training opportunities to keep abreast of digital transformation and the changing operational environment. Officers will be cross-trained to reap synergies and optimise resources. We will build up the capacity and capabilities of our Emergency Medical Services to deliver better emergency response outcomes while meeting the growing demand for such services.",
            "We will enhance our service delivery to the public with more convenient e-services and platforms. ICA has developed ‘MyICA’, a web portal which allows citizens to access a full range of e-services with a single login. The Police Hub is a convenient one-stop portal for the public to lodge reports, provide feedback, and check on transactions.",
            "To enable our law enforcement agencies to protect Singaporeans and deal with security threats more effectively, we have introduced new legislation, such as the Infrastructure Protection Act and the Public Order and Security (Special Powers) Act. We will complete a fundamental review of the Penal Code, where a significant focus has been placed on enhancing protection for vulnerable persons.",
            "We will build on our strong community networks and high levels of public trust, to leverage the collective strength of the community to deal with threats to Singapore’s safety and security.",
            "Our security response to the terrorism threat must be complemented by community vigilance and resilience. SGSecure will continue to be one of our priorities in this area. Since the launch of SGSecure, we have made good progress in raising public awareness about the threat of terrorism. We will next focus on enhancing the community’s preparedness to respond to such threats. At workplaces, we will develop advisories to enhance the capabilities of premise owners and small businesses in contingency planning and protective security. In schools, we will train our students in first aid and emergency drills. We will equip grassroots leaders and volunteers with emergency response skills, such as enabling them to perform psychological first aid to mitigate post-attack trauma. We will continue to partner the community to prevent radical ideologies from taking root in Singapore.",
            "We will also continue to promote our Community First Responders (CFRs) programme. As part of the Save-A-Life initiative, SCDF will install Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) in all HDB estates by 2019, and pilot them in private condominiums. SCDF will collaborate with the Ministry of Health to train more people in CPR and the use of AEDs. SCDF will expand the CFR scheme to include response to other incidents such as rubbish fires.",
            "We will continue to partner the community in the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. SPS will conduct more programmes for inmates and their families.

            ":  Singapore is facing new and complex challenges to our national security. Changes in the external geopolitical landscape are creating new tensions and uncertainty in the global security environment that we must respond to. At the same time, persistent threats – terrorism, cybersecurity risks, and other traditional security challenges – continue to pose significant risks to citizens and our way of life. Our ability to respond to the multivariate threats is critical to ensure that we maintain our stability, cohesion, and resilience.",
            "Dealing with such challenges requires a coordinated response. The National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS) works with other Government agencies to anticipate threats and develop responses in a timely manner, to ensure that the Government as a whole is well-coordinated to deal effectively with present and future risks.",
            "NSCS is working to enhance the Government’s ability to identify emergent risks to national security. These could range from new disruptive technologies to unintended consequences of existing developments. The work will draw from a wide range of experts in relevant fields, including academia. The identification of risks will guide the Government’s prioritisation of response measures, including resource allocation.",
            "lnter-dependencies and cross-cutting risks which affect multiple domains and agencies are not easily discernible but may affect our national security. For instance, our critical infrastructure depends on different networks of utilities, information, and people. Vulnerabilities in any one of these networks could have a far-reaching impact across sectors in the economy. This applies to many domains, such as energy, water, health, infocomm, banking and finance, and transport. NSCS is working with relevant stakeholders in the different domains to identify and mitigate cross-cutting risks. The identification of these risks will also allow the Government to factor in such risks upfront in its long-term planning.",
            "To keep public officers up to date with the changing security environment, NSCS develops and conducts national security education programmes. We want to ensure that our officers in different Government agencies are aware of and sensitive to national security considerations, and are able to translate these considerations into appropriate responses in their own policy domains.",
            "The terrorism threat is at a high and the Government needs to anticipate and deal with the threat upstream. NSCS works with agencies and research institutes to understand trends and research related to violent extremism, and shares these insights with a wide range of partners. These efforts have been useful, for example in equipping front-line officers in non-security domains with the knowledge and skills to safeguard more vulnerable groups like youth, against extremist messaging.",
            "National security is critical for the survival and prosperity of Singapore. The challenges in the coming years are complex. The Government must stay agile and alert. NSCS will continue to work with agencies and stakeholders to identify risks, sensitise our officers, build capabilities, and develop coordinated responses to national security issues."

The Ministry of Transport will further enhance our transport network to connect Singaporeans to destinations island-wide and around the world, to make Singapore our best home.",
            "Our aviation and maritime sectors are the lifelines of Singapore’s economy. They position Singapore as a global city at the heart of international business, trade, and investment. Together, they contribute more than 10% of our GDP and 250,000 jobs.",
            "We cannot take this for granted. Many in the region are working hard to replace us, with shipping and flight routes bypassing Singapore.",
            "To anchor Singapore as a world-class air hub and International Maritime Centre, we are investing in the Changi Airport expansion and the next generation Tuas Port. This will strengthen our edge to seize new opportunities and capture greater growth for Singapore.",
            "We are building new connections with our nearest neighbour, Malaysia. The Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail and Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link will open opportunities for work and play, and give both countries a greater stake in each other’s success.",
            "Within Singapore, we continue to enhance public transport and active mobility, so that Singaporeans can enjoy many choices for work and play.",
            "By 2030, we will expand our rail network by 130km. Construction of the Thomson-East Coast Line is underway. This will be followed by the Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line. We are on track to bring eight in ten households within a 10-minute walk from a train station by 2030. In parallel, we will develop a workforce of capable engineers and skilled technicians.",
            "Rail reliability is a key priority, as we make steady progress towards our MKBF (Mean Kilometres Between Failure) target of 1,000,000 train-km by 2020. We will continue to accelerate asset renewal, and intensify maintenance of our older lines through extended engineering hours.",
            "To advance active mobility, all HDB towns will have cycling networks and good bike parking facilities by 2030. We will introduce a licensing framework for bicycle sharing operators and registration for e-scooters by end-2018. This will enhance enforcement against indiscriminate parking and reckless riding, and instil a more responsible user culture.",
            "We are reviewing the regulatory framework to license the private hire car (PHC) industry. We aim to keep the PHC and taxi industries open and contestable, and protect the interests of commuters and drivers.",
            "As developments in autonomous vehicle (AV) and on-demand transport options gather pace, we will harness these technologies to provide convenient first-last mile commutes.",
            "To create a cleaner and greener environment, we have launched Singapore’s first large-scale electric car sharing service, which aims to deploy up to 1,000 electric cars and 2,000 charge points by 2020. We will also deploy for trial 50 diesel-hybrid buses by 2019 and 60 electric buses by 2020.",
            "As we rely less on cars, precious space will be freed up for other uses that will raise the quality of life for all Singaporeans.",
            "We will further digitalise services and make them more user-friendly to individuals and businesses. To bring greater convenience to businesses, we will put port documentation requirements onto a single portal, and centralise applications for aviation safety approvals.",
            "We will leverage technology to enhance transport operations. We are using data analytics to pre-empt faults in the rail network and improve rail reliability. We will also use predictive analytics, machine learning, and other data tools to enhance air and vessel traffic management, and improve safety and efficiency.",
            "We will facilitate experimentation and promote innovation. The Living Labs at our airport and sea port enable technology providers and industry partners to co-develop innovations in a real operating environment. The One-North test bed facilitates the testing and development of AVs, Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and related technologies. A scheme has been launched to support start-ups to translate new ideas into marketable solutions. And we will share more transport data to foster the co-creation of data-driven innovations.",
            "We will provide all Singaporeans good transport connectivity, regardless of their mobility needs. Today, all MRT stations and bus interchanges have barrier-free access. We will make all public buses wheelchair accessible by 2020. By 2023, we will have 50 Silver Zones and triple the number of pedestrian overhead bridges with lifts.",
            "We are working with industry partners to develop assistive technologies for commuters with special needs, such as the Assistive Passenger Information System for the visual and hearing impaired. The Family-Friendly Advisory Panel is engaging diverse commuter groups to understand their mobility needs, such as families with young children.",
            "We will work closely with our tripartite partners and education institutions, to re-skill and build deep expertise within the transport workforce. Through the air, sea, and land transport Industry Transformation Maps, we will create more than 21,000 new jobs by 2030. There will be many exciting career prospects for Singaporeans, and growth opportunities for Singapore companies.",
            "In 2019, we will mark 200 years since Sir Stamford Raffles landed on our shores. Our strategic geographical location on the trade route between East and West helped transform Singapore from a sleepy fishing village to a modern metropolis. Connectivity continues to be paramount. Our drive towards being a Smart Nation will better connect the way we live, work, and play so that productivity can grow and innovation can flourish. The work of the Future Economy Council will also strengthen our physical, digital, financial, and trade connections to the rest of the world to ensure our relevance. MOT will play its part in supporting these key initiatives to build a better and brighter future for Singapore and Singaporeans."

            "We are tapering the building of new flats to a more sustainable level, but we will continue to maintain a sufficient supply to meet the housing needs of Singaporeans, from young families, to seniors and singles. We will also ensure that public housing remains affordable for all Singaporeans. We have enhanced housing grants significantly for both new and resale flats in recent years, and will continue to review our policies to keep Housing Development Board (HDB) flats affordable.",
            "The new HDB flats will be spread across mature and non-mature estates. The waiting times for these flats are typically around four years. But we have brought forward the construction of some of these new flats, so that the waiting times can be shortened to about two to three years. We will launch a total of 3,000 such flats with shorter waiting times in 2018 and 2019, and will explore doing more in the future.",
            "In the second half of 2018, we will launch the first batch of flats in the new HDB town of Tengah. Tengah will be designed as a “Forest Town”, surrounded by lush greenery and nature. Residents will have convenient access to a wide range of amenities and will enjoy quality living with homes equipped with smart and eco-friendly features. Residents will also benefit from more seamless connectivity within the town, be it by public transport or dedicated cycling paths, as well as new forms of mobility such as autonomous or driverless vehicles.",
            "Even as we do more to improve the design of new towns, we will continue to renew and rejuvenate our existing housing estates and flats through various initiatives such as the Remaking our Heartland programme, Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, and Home Improvement Programme.",
            "At the same time, we will pay special attention to the housing needs of particular groups of Singaporeans.",
            "a. For our seniors, we will pilot a new model of assisted living that combines housing with care services, to enable them to live independently and with dignity. We will review and update the Enhancement for Active Seniors programme with new items such as accessibility solutions for flats with multi-step entrances. We will also do more to help seniors who wish to monetise the value of their flats for retirement.",
            "b. We will continue with efforts to help vulnerable Singaporeans, especially those living in rental flats. The Fresh Start Housing Scheme has given second-timer public rental families a better chance to own a home again. We will study how to further support the homeownership aspirations of our tenants in public rental.",
            "Beyond our housing policies, we will plan and build a smarter, greener, and more liveable city.",
            "a. We will continue with our master-planning efforts to shape a distinctive Singapore – one with the comforts of a modern city, and with its own character, charm, and identity. Our Civic District is a good example of what is possible, with its well-utilised public spaces, and beautifully-restored heritage buildings adapted for arts and cultural uses.",
            "b. We will partner stakeholders to create public and green spaces for all to enjoy. Fort Canning Park will be rejuvenated with enhanced heritage trails, new galleries, and more family-friendly spaces. There will also be opportunities for communities along the 24km Rail Corridor to shape its programming and development. By 2021, the Rail Corridor will be linked to parks, nature areas, and trails such as the Coast-to-Coast Trail and the 150km Round Island Route, giving Singaporeans multiple options to explore green spaces all over our island.",
            "c. We will support the local farming sector to boost productivity and enhance our food security. We released new farm land for the first time in over two decades, and the enhanced Agricultural Productivity Fund will help local farms adopt more productive technologies. We will also do more to strengthen the overall food ecosystem to keep our food supply safe and resilient.",
            "d. We will work closely with the built environment industry on its transformation, to raise productivity and to develop innovative urban solutions. We target to double the adoption of productive construction methods from the current 20% to 40% of all new projects by 2020. Facility Management (FM) and property transaction services will also be part of this industry transformation, with a strong push on Design for Maintainability and smart FM to keep our built infrastructure in good shape.",
            "The work we do over the next few years is critical because it will set the foundation for longer-term major projects that are in the pipeline. Over the coming decade, Singapore will be undergoing its most extensive transformation yet. We have new and tremendous possibilities to make Singapore stand out as a leading city for Asia and the world.",
            "We are building Changi Airport Terminal 5 and Tuas Port to expand our airport and sea port capacities, and to position ourselves for the future. We are also building two new connections to Malaysia – the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail and Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link. All these will strengthen our air, sea, and land links with the world, and enhance our status as a regional and international hub.",
            "Within Singapore, we are developing new regional centres in Jurong and Woodlands, as well as new clusters outside of the downtown core, for example, the Jurong Innovation District and Punggol Digital District. These will enable us to broaden our urban development, attract more investments, and support the creation of jobs closer to home.",
            "Where possible, we will introduce district-level infrastructure such as common services tunnel, district cooling, and pneumatic waste conveyance systems in these new developments for greater resource efficiencies. We will also see how best to deploy advanced technologies such as real-time integrated FM, autonomous vehicles, and smart energy grids. We want to make full use of technologies to uplift our quality of life, and to take Singapore’s sustainable development to the next level.",
            "At the same time, we are redoubling our efforts to green Singapore, and enhance our City in a Garden. By 2030, 90% of Singaporeans will live within a 10-minute walk of a park, and our network of green corridors will be expanded from 310km to 400km.",
            "In this next phase of urban transformation, we must work even harder to distinguish ourselves from other global cities. We want Singapore to be a truly outstanding city for Asia and the world, where the human spirit flourishes. We want to be an inclusive city for Singaporeans of all ages and abilities; a home where everyone has a place, and everyone belongs.",
            "To achieve this, we must move beyond the status quo. That is why we have set out bold plans to transform our city. We want to partner all Singaporeans – the community, businesses, and other stakeholders – to shape our future city together.",
            "Singapore is our home, where we raise our families, create shared memories, and forge close bonds with one another. Together, we can build a better home and a better Singapore, for our families and for future generations of Singaporeans."

            "Climate change is a global concern. As a low-lying island state, Singapore is especially vulnerable to its impact. We will continue to advocate for and contribute to global climate action. We will undertake our Voluntary National Review of the Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations in July 2018. To rally the region, we will organise the Special ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Climate Action (SAMCA) and Expanded SAMCA (E-SAMCA) in July 2018.",
            "The 2016 Climate Action Plan set out our adaptation measures to build Singapore’s resilience to climate change, and our mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in every sector. The carbon tax which takes effect from 2019 will provide an economy-wide price signal to spur emissions reduction. In this Year of Climate Action and beyond, we will encourage and support businesses and communities to reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainable living and working.",
            "We will continue to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as enhancing stormwater management systems and diversifying our water supply with more desalination and NEWater plants. In tandem, we are pursuing better management of our water demand. We will also deepen our local research capabilities on climate science and weather through the Centre for Climate Research Singapore.",
            "Using resources efficiently is critical to reducing emissions, limiting pollution, and strengthening Singapore’s economic resilience. We will strive to become a Zero Waste nation and extract greater value from waste as a resource, so as to achieve our vision of a circular economy. Just as we have closed the water loop by recycling water endlessly, we should similarly strive towards closing the waste loop.",
            "The Government will take the lead by developing infrastructure and frameworks, such as the Extended Producer Responsibility framework to enhance recycling and manage electrical and electronic waste. We are implementing mandatory reporting of packaging data and packaging waste reduction plans by 2021, and supporting the wider use of on-site food waste digesters at commercial premises and hawker centres. We are working towards the reuse of incineration bottom ash to extend the lifespan of Semakau Landfill.",
            "At the same time, we need to kindle in Singaporeans a national consciousness towards the environment, where everyone takes individual and collective responsibility and plays a part through practising sustainable consumption and recycling at home.",
            "As our population and economy grow, the demands on our infrastructure will increase, even as our manpower and resource constraints tighten. We must transform our environmental services industry and workforce through technology and innovation, to support our move towards greater carbon and resource efficiency.",
            "The upcoming Tuas Water Reclamation Plant and the Integrated Waste Management Facility, the first in the world, will be our signature innovation platform to reap synergies from the water-energy-waste nexus. Effluent water from wastewater treatment will be used for cooling waste incineration equipment; food waste will be co-digested with used water sludge to enhance biogas production to increase the overall plant thermal efficiency. Integrating the facilities will reduce carbon emissions by more than 200,000 tonnes annually.",
            "We are stepping up research and development and improving resource efficiency. For instance, the Waste-to-Energy Research Facility, the first of its kind in Singapore, will enable the transition of emerging technologies (such as turning waste and biomass into synthetic gas) from research into demonstration and test-bedding projects. To enhance energy efficiency in water treatment, we are leading research in technologies such as anaerobic membrane bioreactors for used water treatment, and electro-deionisation and biomimicry for desalinated water. To expand the use of solar energy, we are tapping reservoir surface space and piloting a floating solar system at Tengeh Reservoir.",
            "To better serve the public, we are leveraging smart technologies such as sensors and other digital technologies. As part of our Smart Water Grid, we have set up 320 sensor stations island-wide to monitor 5,500km of water distribution pipe network real-time. We are conducting trials on the Automated Meter Reading system to provide timely water consumption data to help households save water.",
            "We will provide opportunities for technology collaboration and adaptation across the environmental services industry. As part of the Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map to ensure a vibrant, sustainable, and professional cleaning and waste management industry, we are embracing the use of automation, robotics, and data analytics to enhance productivity in the industry. Besides new public housing estates, the pneumatic waste conveyance systems are being implemented in new private residential developments with at least 500 dwelling units. Increasingly, we will use technology to remotely manage waste collection, and robotics to sort recyclables at materials recovery facilities. The use of autonomous cleaning equipment will free workers to focus on higher value work. The future of delivering environmental services will provide an exciting array of green jobs for our people.",
            "As we strive to build a liveable and sustainable Singapore, we will continue to integrate and transform our blue and green spaces. Through the Active, Beautiful, Clean (ABC) Waters programme, we will continue to turn concrete drains, canals, and reservoirs into vibrant and beautiful rivers, streams, and lakes. Over the next few years, ABC Waters projects at locations such as the Jurong Lake and Sungei Whampoa will be completed.",
            "While the Government will continue to strengthen our regulatory regime to safeguard our environment and public health, creating a liveable and endearing home ultimately depends on everyone taking ownership of our environment. Through the Sustainable Singapore movement, we will continue to rally Singaporeans, the larger community, and industry partners to realise this shared vision.",
            "Our hawker centres are an important hub for social interaction and an integral part of our daily life and national identity. Beyond providing affordable and good food, our hawker centres are important community spaces that bring together people from all walks of life, and help to strengthen the bonds of our multi-racial society. In 2015, we announced that we would build 20 new hawker centres by 2027. Since then, seven new modern hawker centres have opened. Our Hawker Centre 3.0 initiatives are aimed at ensuring the viability, vitality, and continuity of the hawker trade. We are extending productivity initiatives such as the automated tray return systems and centralised dishwashing services to more hawker centres. We will continue to invest in developing and enhancing our hawker centres to ensure that future generations continue to enjoy our unique and vibrant hawker culture.",

            "We regularly review our corporate regulations to ensure we have an efficient, transparent, and business-friendly environment. We will partner the private sector to co-create solutions for businesses, and harness technology to improve services for businesses and citizens.",
            "As ASEAN Chair in 2018, we are promoting ASEAN financial integration with initiatives to sustain growth, boost resilience, and foster innovation for the region.",
            "We will continue to support Singapore’s development as a smart, green, and liveable city. The introduction of a carbon tax is part of an overall approach to improve Singapore’s energy efficiency and address our climate change commitments. Major investments will be made to rejuvenate ageing infrastructure, develop new districts and transport networks, and enhance our air, sea, and land links. We will invest in Strategic National Projects that lay the foundation for a Smart Nation, and strengthen our connectivity to the world.",
            "The Government has substantially increased social spending in major areas including education, healthcare, housing, Workfare, and Silver Support. MOF will continue to support individuals and families, strengthen partnerships between the Government and the community, and encourage a spirit of giving through SG Cares.",
            "We are investing heavily in pre-school, education, and skills upgrading, to ensure that citizens have opportunities to develop their potential throughout life. We will support Singaporeans to stay healthy, make informed healthcare choices, and prepare for their healthcare needs in old age. We will also continue to expand our healthcare capacity and strengthen long-term care, while moderating the growth in healthcare costs. We will do more to strengthen our families and enable our seniors to stay active, contribute meaningfully, and age with confidence. We will promote sports, arts and heritage, philanthropy, and volunteerism, to build common interests for a stronger society.",
            "Singapore is on a sound fiscal footing today, because we have always emphasised prudent spending and built resilient and broad-based revenue sources. We have also invested our resources wisely and used our investment returns in sustainable ways.",
            "We must continue to maintain a sound and sustainable fiscal system, and ensure a balanced budget over the medium term. Our fiscal position is expected to tighten considerably in the coming years due to rising expenditures, especially in healthcare, infrastructure, and security. On the revenue side, we have to adjust to changes in the global environment that could impact our competitiveness. Several countries are moving to reduce their corporate income tax rates. There are also ongoing discussions to develop international tax rules under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project.",
            "This is why we are taking steps to strengthen our revenue position, including through an increase in the Goods and Services Tax. As we build up our revenues, we will ensure that taxes remain competitive to encourage private enterprise and individual initiative. We will continue to keep our overall tax and transfer system equitable, fair, and progressive.",
            "We will also continue to seek the best value for the money we spend. We will do this by managing our expenditure growth carefully, and continually seeking more cost-effective solutions in the public sector.",
            "We will explore new funding approaches for large-scale infrastructure investments, particularly through borrowing by Statutory Boards and Government-owned companies. We will leverage the strength of our financial position to optimise our borrowing, and invest sustainably in longer-term infrastructure that will position Singapore well for the future.",
            "We will continue to be good stewards of our reserves. Our reserves provide us with the means to weather shocks and crises, and strengthen investor and market confidence in Singapore. We will continue to uphold the framework that enables us to invest our reserves for long-term returns, and to use part of the returns to supplement our budgetary needs.",
            "We will harness our fiscal resources prudently and responsibly, so as to advance the well-being of all Singaporeans. We will do so in partnership with citizens and the community."

Working with the people, our partners and stakeholders, we aim to realise our vision of ‘A Trusted Legal System; A Trusted Singapore’.",
            "MinLaw will continue to review our laws, to ensure that they remain progressive, modern, and relevant to the evolving needs of our society.",
            "To ensure just outcomes and fair procedures in the criminal justice system, we amended the Criminal Procedure Code and Evidence Act in 2018. We are reviewing the Penal Code together with the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the review committee will make its recommendations later this year. We intend to cover new offences to deal with the changing crime environment, introduce measures to enhance protection for vulnerable victims, and assess the adequacy of existing punishments for sexual offences. The laws on attempted suicide and marital rape immunity are also being reviewed.",
            "We are working closely with the Judiciary and legal practitioners on a broadbased review of our civil justice system. The aim is to keep legal costs affordable, and to reduce complexity of civil proceedings. To meet these goals, we are reviewing the framework of legal costs, and enhancing judicial control in civil proceedings. We are also studying measures to make it easier and more effective for plaintiffs to enforce judgments given in their favour, such as maintenance orders made in matrimonial disputes.",
            "Together with the Ministry of Social and Family Development and the courts, MinLaw has established the Family Justice Review Committee to enhance the family justice system, by reducing acrimony and stress in family-related litigation, to ensure a system that centres on the welfare of the child and the family.",
            "MinLaw will continue to provide legal aid and ensure that justice remains accessible to vulnerable Singaporeans. We will also enhance frameworks that enable Singaporeans to resolve their disputes quickly in a cost effective manner, and as amicably as possible. The Community Mediation Centre provides mediation services and works with other agencies to promote neighbourliness within our communities. The Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals and the Small Claims Tribunals (SCT) provide cost-effective avenues for our people and businesses to resolve disputes without the need for legal representation. We are reviewing the claims limits for the SCT to allow more to benefit from this quick and inexpensive forum.",
            "We will continue to drive Singapore’s development as an international legal services hub, help our legal professionals acquire expertise in new growth areas, and assist them to access the opportunities afforded by the growth of Asia and ASEAN. MinLaw will also continue to promote the international use of Singapore law, standards, and frameworks in commerce and dispute resolution.",
            "MinLaw will work closely with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, the Singapore International Mediation Centre, and the Singapore International Commercial Court to strengthen our position as a venue of choice for international dispute resolution. We have updated the relevant legislation and will strengthen our infrastructure with the expansion of Maxwell Chambers.",
            "We will help law firms and lawyers to develop the expertise required to better capture growth opportunities in key legal practice areas such as restructuring, and projects and infrastructure.",
            "We are also helping them to prepare for the future economy through the adoption of technology, internationalisation, and capability building. We launched the “Tech Start for Law” programme in 2017 with the Law Society and then-SPRING",
            "2",
            ", and will be developing the next phase of this programme to meet the needs of our law firms. We also launched the “Lawyers Go Global” programme with the Law Society and then-IE Singapore in early 2018, which will help our law firms seize opportunities abroad through overseas mission trips, and branding and marketing efforts.",
            "The Singapore Academy of Law has launched the Legal Industry Framework for Training and Education (LIFTED), which supports legal practitioners, in-house counsel, and legal support/ paralegals. We will work with the Academy, as well as other stakeholders, to support Singaporean lawyers in deepening skills and qualifications through the SkillsFuture Study Awards and SkillsFuture Credit.",
            "IP is an area with new growth potential. We are progressively reviewing our IP laws to keep pace with technology changes, strengthen IP protection, and enable industry to tap on potential gains. To support an innovation-driven economy, the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore will develop more expertise in IP management, strategy, and valuation, and help our businesses realise the full value of their IP through its IP ValueLab.",

            "We have been actively participating in international law-making at regional and multilateral forums. We play a leading role in key negotiations such as dispute settlement, international cooperation to combat crime, and the recognition and enforcement of judgments. We do our part for the international community by serving as a neutral venue for state-related disputes, enabled through partnerships with the Permanent Court of Arbitration among others. We will further the development of international law expertise in emerging issues through the support of local think-tanks.",
            "In line with the Smart Nation initiative, MinLaw and its Statutory Boards have embarked on digitalisation efforts to raise productivity and work efficiency, and to improve service delivery. We aim to improve the user experience by revamping our digital platforms, implementing mobile app-based services and employing data analytics to better understand our customers.",
            "The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) is also actively leveraging data and technology, including the development of a paperless Land Titles Registry system and the use of drones to support land administration and management. SLA has been leading Singapore’s efforts in building geospatial capabilities together with the Government Technology Agency. It has launched GeoWorks, which facilitates the cocreation of business opportunities with start-ups and industry partners. SLA will be releasing the Singapore Geospatial Master Plan that will set out the strategic initiatives to strengthen Singapore's geospatial capabilities."

            ":  Singapore has succeeded because we have been able to anticipate challenges and opportunities, take a long-term view, and plan ahead to prepare for the future. Singaporeans expect this of their Government. The Strategy Group coordinates and organises the Public Service to implement the strategic priorities of the Government, in order to achieve the best outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans.",
            "We are entering a new phase of nation building. The world around us is changing rapidly and often in unexpected ways. Our own economy is undergoing a fundamental transformation amidst a shift in the global economic centre of gravity towards Asia. Technology will change the way we live, work, and play. And the texture of our society is evolving as our population ages and new social challenges emerge.",
            "This more complex landscape will require policy responses to challenges that are still emerging and therefore not yet well-defined. It will require Government agencies to work more closely together because solutions to policy challenges will increasingly cut across ministry domains. We will also need to tackle the challenges of today, while at the same time building for tomorrow. The Strategy Group identifies these cross-cutting medium- to long-term priorities, and organises the efforts of Government agencies to collectively address them.",
            "We will continue to strengthen Whole-of-Government planning and execution. First, we will stretch the bounds of our ambition for a better future that we will build together. Second, we will ensure that all parts of Government work in stronger alignment in pursuit of these goals. Third, we will ensure that resources and capabilities support our national priorities.",
            "Our population policy is one such cross-cutting issue that will define this phase of nation building. Our changing demography has wide-ranging effects on many Government strategies – including in areas such as the economy, healthcare, infrastructure, defence planning, and social cohesion.",
            "In the medium-term, our ageing population presents both challenges and opportunities to sustain a dynamic economy. The slower growth of our local workforce provides a strong impetus to press on with economic restructuring. In the long-term, our fertility rates and our openness to others who are willing and able to contribute to Singapore will shape the type of society that future generations of Singaporeans will live in.",
            "We will thus focus on three broad strategies across Government to maintain a population profile that improves the lives of each generation. First, we will develop and implement policies to enable all Singaporeans to age with purpose and dignity. Second, we will make Singapore a great place for families, where marriage and parenthood are achievable, enjoyable, and celebrated. Third, we will maintain a careful balance in our foreign worker as well as immigrant flows.",
            "In doing so, our population policies will support a cohesive society and vibrant economy. Singapore will continue to be a place where Singaporeans are proud to call home.",
            "Climate change is another cross-cutting issue that requires a Whole-of-Nation response. Singapore must address climate change and safeguard our collective future. As a low-lying, tropical island state, we must develop plans to address the impact of climate change such as rising sea levels, higher temperatures, and more extreme rainfall patterns. At the same time, we need to work as part of the international community to reduce our collective carbon footprint.",
            "The Strategy Group will coordinate Singapore’s domestic and international actions to protect ourselves against the impact of climate change, and support international efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. We will fulfil our commitment to the Paris Agreement. The Government will implement the carbon tax, and work together with all stakeholders, including people and businesses, to reduce energy use, increase energy efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gases. To this end, 2018 has been designated as the Year of Climate Action to raise awareness and intensify the national effort to bring down our emissions and adopt sustainable practices.",
            "Just as we had seized new opportunities to develop solutions to address water scarcity, we can and must do the same for climate change. We will leverage our strengths in research, technology, and innovation to seize green growth opportunities. We will develop solutions to address sustainability challenges in our region and beyond, as countries make the transition towards low-carbon economies. This will create good opportunities for Singaporeans and our companies, and ensure Singapore remains economically competitive, sustainable, vibrant, and liveable.",
            "Across Government, we are building from a position of strength. We will continue to plan for the medium- to long-term and lay strong foundations for our collective future. We invite all Singaporeans to join us in this journey."

We aspire to serve Singapore and Singaporeans well through anticipating their needs, and delivering services to them in an agile and responsive manner. We will organise ourselves to serve from the people's perspective, not from agencies’ perspective; strengthen the trust and bond with Singaporeans; and uphold the Public Service values of Integrity, Service, and Excellence.",
            "While we develop a long term plan for the next lap for our Public Service, we will press on with efforts for our agencies to better deliver on the Government’s priorities. All public sector agencies are developing plans to transform their operations and services. We will further integrate the Public Service by grouping services provided by different agencies together for our citizens at key moments in their lives. We are starting with Moments-of-Life for Families, which aims to be more citizencentric, intuitive, and convenient for Singaporeans starting a family to access Government schemes.",
            "Our agencies will go beyond “Whole-of-Government”, and mobilise “Whole-of-Nation” efforts. We will partner businesses, citizens, and other stakeholders to develop better solutions together. We will continue to actively reach out to others, whether overseas or in the private sector, hear their views, learn from their successes and failures, and improve ourselves along the way. We will communicate clearly and simply to the public, and seek to bring everyone on board.",
            "Our comparative advantage is in anticipating needs and responding to challenges. We will sustain this advantage. We will champion innovation and test-bed new ideas. We will respond quickly to issues and be more efficient, innovative, and productive. We will tap on digital technologies as an enabler. We will sharpen and deepen our Public Sector Transformation efforts, making use of, and responding to the disruptions brought on by new technology and business models.",

            "We will build a system for our people to thrive, with shared values and aspirations for Singapore to succeed. In line with the SkillsFuture movement, we will also equip public officers with the skills necessary for tomorrow’s challenges. The Civil Service College has refreshed its training programmes and methods of delivery to meet these needs. We have restructured career paths to give officers career progression opportunities, regardless of academic qualifications.",
            "We will bring people of diverse skillsets to work together. We will also continue to build new capabilities for the Public Service to serve Singapore’s future needs. These include stronger engineering capabilities to develop our city infrastructure, and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) expertise to make us a Smart Nation and Digital Government. We are training public officers in data analytics and digital literacy, so as to better understand citizens’ needs and improve public services.",
            "We value our officers and will continue to look after their needs. Agencies will adopt more flexible and inclusive hiring practices, including hiring more persons with disabilities and freelancers. As a diverse workforce, we recognise that officers have different needs at different stages of life. We will consider more flexible practices that better suit officers’ life-cycle needs.",
            "Transformation requires strong leadership. We will continue to invest in developing our leaders, and ensure that they have the right values and skills. Diversity of skills within leadership teams is essential for keeping our system resilient against emerging challenges. We will continue to ensure a strong leadership pipeline. Our leadership development efforts have expanded to cover specialist leaders in all fields and from more diverse backgrounds. We are better equipping leaders to lead transformation efforts through coaching support, 360 degree assessments, and exposure to more diverse experiences. We will do more to hone the managerial and leadership skills of junior leaders.",
            "The Singapore Public Service aims to work in a \"Whole-of-Nation\" manner to deliver a better future, and strengthen the trust and bond between the Government and Singaporeans. We will continue to strive to be an enduring pillar for our nation’s success."

We will build on the strong foundations, and use digital technologies decisively to transform the Public Service. Citizens and businesses can look forward to transacting with the Government in a paperless and presence-less manner, anytime and anywhere. This does not mean that the Government intends to replace the human touch with digitalisation and automation. We will continue to serve with heart, using digital technology to do more for citizens and with citizens.",
            "A key strategy is to use the digital medium to provide integrated, user-centric services to citizens. The Moments-of-Life app for Families will be piloted in June 2018, providing one-stop services for new parents and ensuring support for every child. A similar approach will be taken to provide seamless experiences to citizens at other significant milestones of their lives, as well as for businesses interacting with the Government. We will engage citizens regularly to better understand their needs, and design more effective solutions for them.",

We are establishing a Centre of Excellence for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Smart Systems, with expertise in areas such as data science, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and cybersecurity. This will allow us to keep up with rapidly changing technologies, and have a greater capacity to innovate. In other words, “Think Big, Start Small, Act Fast”. We want to recruit the best Singaporean talent and give them opportunities to transform our nation and society. We are also committed to preparing public officers to be digitally ready to use new digital tools and solutions to do their job better.",

            "In the early years of our independence, Singapore committed ourselves to long term investments in physical infrastructure, to build public housing, public schools, roads, and parks to raise our quality of life and make ourselves an exemplary city-state. Today, in this digital age, we will need to build leading edge digital infrastructure. Our Smart Nation Strategic National Projects include a National Digital Identity and e-Payments, which are essential for both the digital economy and digital government, to support seamless digital transactions and digital commerce.",
            "We are making good progress on these projects. They will complement the Government’s digital economy efforts to accelerate digitalisation of sectors, build a strong local Infocomm and Media sector, and create future digital technology sectors.",
            "Human capital remains our key national resource. We must ensure that all Singaporeans are equipped with relevant digital skills to take advantage of new jobs and opportunities. The Government will continue to invest in skills training and upgrading through the TechSkills Accelerator and SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace programme.",
            "As we push ahead with digital technology, we need to also ensure that no one is left behind. Our digitalisation efforts should be inclusive-by-design. On the part of Government, we will set digital service standards and review all Government websites and digital services to ensure they are user-friendly and accessible. The Digital Readiness Blueprint will outline strategies for digital access, digital literacy, and digital participation, to ensure that every Singaporean has the means, skills, confidence, and motivation to make use of technology to achieve a better quality of life.",
            "As a Smart Nation, we must also be aware of and prepared for new threats and risks arising from technology. Robust data governance and cybersecurity measures are critical. With the enactment of the Public Sector Governance Act in April 2018, the Government will be implementing measures to safeguard data sharing within the public sector. We will continue to regularly review the security and resilience of our systems, to safeguard the Government and citizens’ data, and to keep them safe from malicious cyber activities.",
            "For the private sector, the Personal Data Protection Commission is reviewing the laws on personal data protection to ensure that they remain relevant. But we all need to play our part, as businesses and citizens, to adopt good cyber-hygiene, be alert and aware, and make cybersecurity a priority.",
            "Across the world, digital technologies are transforming our way of life and how we live, work, and play. To prosper and stay relevant in the world, and to build a better future for ourselves, Singapore has to embrace these changes, experiment and innovate, invest in the right capabilities and skills, and build a Smart Nation. We have made progress and we need to press on with confidence, working in concert across Government agencies, companies, and communities."

Singapore has benefited from a rules-based open multilateral trading architecture, by which nations have prospered. However, this has come under pressure as workers, particularly those in the more advanced economies, feel dislocated by technology and globalisation. Some countries have taken on more protectionist and nativist attitudes towards trade and investment.",

We are one of the key financial hubs in the world and will strengthen our attributes to be a digital hub.",

Asia is where the next billion middle-class consumers will be, and where our enterprises will find abundant growth opportunities. We must develop a deep understanding of the region, not just economically, but also culturally. This way, we can carve out a niche as a place where companies and people seek to come, to understand and take advantage of the diversity of Asian consumer tastes and preferences.",
            "We will strengthen our value proposition as a launch pad to help enterprises coming through Singapore connect with the region and the world. We have established an Infrastructure Office to bring together local and international partners across the value chain to identify opportunities, and facilitate investments and financing. This will enable these enterprises to tap on the rising infrastructure demand in the region. We will also position Singapore as a test-bedding hub for start-ups developing new products, services, and solutions for regional and global markets.",

These MNCs will bring with them ideas, innovative capabilities, and expertise, to create new value for Asian markets based on our insights. We seek also to be the go-to place for Asian MNCs that are taking their business global. Amidst these, MNCs, in working with local suppliers, will help to transfer knowledge to and deepen capabilities of our enterprises, and strengthen our corporate ecosystem. They will also create good jobs which will place our people at the forefront of developments for their industries.",
            "Enterprise Singapore (ESG) will work with all enterprises who want to grow and transform. ESG will be enterprise-centric and walk with enterprises at different stages of their growth, including to tailor programmes to their specific needs. For example, we will simplify access to assistance programmes for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) looking to upgrade their capabilities, while providing more customised support for growth-oriented enterprises to deepen their capabilities and innovative capacities. We will also support our enterprises’ internationalisation efforts through our global networks, and encourage partnerships between enterprises so that they are better placed to seize new opportunities and projects abroad. ESG and the Economic Development Board (EDB) will work closely with each other, and with other agencies such as the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), to support enterprises in these endeavours.",

As we deploy technology and build new capabilities, we will also equip our workers to be digitally confident, so that they have the skills and the capabilities to take advantage of opportunities in the future economy.",
            "We will remain open to talent from around the world that complements our local workforce and raises our competitiveness, especially in new growth areas. Through the Global Innovation Alliance, we will strengthen our linkages to innovation hubs across the world. Our students will be connected to the world; they will transcend borders and be inspired by new ideas. Our people will find exciting opportunities to pursue, and diverse talent with whom to collaborate.",
            "We will remain an open economy, with a pro-business, pro-competition, and pro-innovation environment. We will meld the best ideas, talent, and enterprises of the world in Singapore. We can and will transform our economy, as all stakeholders pull together to create good jobs and opportunities for our people."

            ": Every generation seeks to do better than the one before. Besides improving employment outcomes, we want a more inclusive workforce, more progressive workplaces, and a greater sense of security in retirement. Despite global disruptions to business models and employment arrangements, Singaporeans can distinguish ourselves by becoming an agile workforce that charts a bold path forward.",
            "To have better jobs and higher incomes, our workers need businesses to transform. To stay competitive and innovative, our businesses need workers to adapt. We must maximise the benefits from technology, and minimise the cost of dislocations. To achieve good employment outcomes, we need business transformation and worker adaptation to be in sync with each other.",
            "As our society matures, we aspire for a more inclusive workforce that values seniors and working women, and provides opportunities to persons with disabilities and ex-offenders. Our workplaces must have more progressive Human Resource (HR) practices with strong emphasis on employee protection, engagement, safety, and health. Industrial relations must continue to be underpinned by mutual respect and fair play between employers and employees. This has been the cornerstone of Singapore’s unique brand of tripartism that has stood the test of time.",
            "With longer life expectancy, we must continue to strengthen retirement adequacy. We should enable Singaporeans to work as long as they wish to, whether through regular employment or participation in the emerging gig economy. We should also ensure that our Central Provident Fund (CPF) system remains responsive to the needs of Singaporeans.",
            "We will scale up the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme to support the implementation of Industry Transformation Maps for more pervasive productivity improvements and innovation, especially among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Together with partners like Enterprise Singapore and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute, we will promote ready-to-go solutions and industry-level projects for maximum reach and impact.",
            "We will launch SkillsFuture for Enterprises to help businesses make human capital development a key part of their corporate capabilities, to better support their internationalisation and growth. To spur transformation, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will work through economic agencies to provide selective flexibility in our foreign manpower policy to help businesses and industries meet short-term or emerging skills gaps.",
            "We will step up support for mid-career jobseekers and the long-term unemployed. The enhanced Place-and-Train schemes and Professional Conversion Programmes will help more workers re-skill and move into new occupations or sectors with progression. The new Career Trial will enable more jobseekers to try out short-term work stints, to facilitate their assessment of new jobs and careers.",
            "We will also transform our employment services through technology. The “MyCareersFuture” portal will make job searches more personalised, smarter, and faster, to better help jobseekers and employers find suitable matches.",
            "Our foreign manpower policy will remain carefully calibrated to support our economic objectives while moderating social impact. We will continuously review the Fair Consideration Framework to secure the interests of working Singaporeans.",
            "Singapore also has much to gain from our enterprises accessing global expertise. Through the Capability Transfer Programme, businesses can speed up the transfer of global expertise to strengthen their Singaporean core. We will support businesses that are committed to building a complementary local-foreign workforce.",
            "The re-employment age was raised to 67 in July 2017. With active ageing and improved health, we will work with tripartite partners to enable more seniors to work longer. Through WorkPro, we will support employers to re-design jobs to make them easier, safer, and smarter for seniors. We will actively promote the adoption of the Tripartite Standard on age-friendly workplace practices.",
            "The Progressive Wage Model (PWM), which was initiated by the labour movement, has benefited more than 70,000 resident workers in the cleaning, landscaping, and security sectors. We will work with tripartite partners to enhance and extend PWM to more sectors to give more lower-wage workers better progression in jobs, skills, and wages.",
            "We will support those with caregiving responsibilities, such as working mothers, to achieve both career and family aspirations. While our full-time employment rate for women ranks highly compared to OECD countries, our female part-time employment rate is relatively low. Through the Work-Life Grant, we will support more employers to provide Flexible Working Arrangements (FWAs) and help more companies adopt the Tripartite Standards on FWAs.",
            "We will support and fund employers to enhance the employment and employability of persons with disabilities through the Open Door Programme. We will also work with the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) to equip ex-offenders with relevant skills to re-integrate into the workforce.",
            "We will champion fair and progressive workplaces and enhance core employment protection for all. We will remove the Employment Act’s salary cap to extend coverage to all managers and executives.",
            "Through the HR Industry Manpower Plan, we will strengthen the HR sector, uplift the HR profession, and promote progressive HR practices. We will also help good employers distinguish themselves through the Human Capital Partnership Programme.",
            "We will help to ensure safe and healthy workplaces. The Work Injury Compensation Act will be amended to improve protection for injured workers and shorten insurance claims processing times. Having piloted the Return-To-Work programme since 2017, we will expand coverage to support all injured workers seeking rehabilitation treatment at public hospitals by 2020. Through the programme, injured workers can recover more quickly and resume work earlier. Our Workplace Safety and Health 2028 plan will chart new strategies to achieve a workplace fatality rate of less than one per 100,000 workers by 2028.",
            "Besides helping regular employees, we will support self-employed persons and freelancers, including those who engage in the emerging gig economy. We will help them by promoting fair contracting terms, making available prolonged medical leave insurance products, and developing competency frameworks for skills upgrading so that their choice of self-employment is a viable and sustainable career option.",
            "Singaporeans can enjoy security in retirement through drawing on their CPF savings, discretionary savings, the support of their families, and monetising their housing assets. To help them plan better for retirement, the CPF Board will extend the voluntary consultation service that is currently available to all members turning age 55, to all members turning age 65 as well. We will supplement this with digital services to help more Singaporeans plan and improve their financial well-being in retirement.",
            "We will provide more support for CPF members who top-up their own and their family members’ CPF, and enhance options to invest their savings for higher returns. These measures will further help members get higher retirement payouts.",
            "We will continue to help lower-income Singaporeans build up their retirement savings through the Workfare Income Supplement scheme and to supplement their retirement income through the Silver Support scheme. We will also help self-employed persons make Medisave contributions in a convenient and timely manner.",
            "Singapore's approach to tripartism sets a high bar. We have consistently sought to be both pro-business and pro-worker in all that we do.",
            "With every generation of leaders, the tripartite partnership must be refreshed. MOM values the trust painstakingly built up over the years. With tripartism as our bedrock, we will nurture an agile workforce that is future-ready. With trust as our foundation, we will forge ahead together with our tripartite partners to fulfil the shared vision of an inclusive workforce, progressive workplaces, and secure retirement for all."

We will continue to strengthen our focus on Character and Citizenship Education and enhance Values-in-Action programmes, to provide students with more opportunities to build their character. We will deepen students’ understanding of our nation and society, as well as the region and the world. We will continue to build upon our bilingual language foundation, and make the learning of languages encouraging and fun. We are rolling out plans for enhanced outdoor learning and activities.",
            "We will foster the joy of learning in our students, to make learning meaningful and enduring for our students, and foster a passion for lifelong learning. As an Asian society, we put strong focus on academic excellence, but we need to continue with efforts to dial back the over-emphasis on examination results, which can dampen the enthusiasm for learning. We are on track to implement the changes to the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) scoring and Secondary One posting systems in 2021.",
            "We will continue to enhance Applied and Experiential Learning in our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). Through learning by doing, students will be able to cultivate an innovative spirit and apply their knowledge and skills in the real world.",
            "We will support students in uncovering their strengths and developing their talents, by ensuring that multiple pathways are available across the education system. This includes partnering industries to offer our students real world learning opportunities through programmes such as the Institute of Technical Education’s (ITE) Work-Learn Technical Diploma, the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes, and the SkillsFuture Work-Study Degree programmes. Through initiatives such as Direct School Admission in schools and aptitude-based admission in IHLs, we recognise the interests and non-academic abilities of students in our admission systems.",
            "We will also formalise and strengthen Education and Career Guidance efforts, to give students more time, guidance, and opportunities to explore their interests, and decide on their specialisations and career options. To support this, we will streamline polytechnic courses and introduce more Common Entry Programmes.",
            "We are bringing about a major change in our IHLs to also assume the mission of supporting the education and training needs of working adults. In support of industry transformation, our IHLs will significantly expand their offerings of industry-relevant and modular training programmes. Together with private training providers and employers, we will build a vibrant and high-quality lifelong learning industry that enables continual up-skilling and re-skilling of the workforce.",
            "All these efforts are anchored on the philosophy of SkillsFuture, which is to support all Singaporeans, regardless of their starting points, to uncover their strengths and interests, and learn throughout life through multiple pathways to develop skills mastery. Over time, our society will embrace a broad meritocracy of skills.",
            "We will build on our efforts to develop ‘smart schools’, to better prepare our students for the future, and to be responsible members of a more digitalised society.",
            "We will support self-directed as well as collaborative learning by enhancing the Singapore Student Learning Space, which will be rolled out to all schools this year. Students will be empowered to learn anytime, anywhere, and at their own pace.",
            "We will raise the capabilities of teachers as designers of learning experiences, leverage technology to improve learning experiences, and promote collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas.",
            "We will strengthen the interface between schools and parents through the Parents Gateway. This online platform will allow both groups to work together to better support the learning needs of our students.",
            "As we make bold strides in our education landscape, we must ensure that the disadvantaged are not left behind.",
            "Education will continue to be a key pillar of social mobility. We are expanding the number of MOE Kindergartens, as part of the Government’s efforts to improve quality, affordability, and accessibility in the pre-school sector, to ensure a good start for all children. Our schools will continue to provide equal opportunities for all students, regardless of background, to access quality education. We will continue to expand and strengthen our ecosystem of partnerships, working closely with our stakeholders to bring out the best in our students. This includes collaboration with Self-Help Groups to provide holistic support to less advantaged students and their families.",
            "To cater to students who need a conducive after-school care environment, we will expand the number of school-based Student Care Centres (SCCs) and places. All primary schools will have a school-based SCC by 2020. They will cater to the educational, social, and emotional well-being of our students, especially those from disadvantaged families.",
            "We must uphold and enhance education as a platform for social mixing. From 2019, we will reserve 20% of places at every affiliated secondary school for students who do not benefit from affiliation priority. We will actively promote interaction among students of all backgrounds through initiatives such as applied learning, Co-Curricular Activities and Outward Bound School camps.",
            "From 2019, we will roll out compulsory education for children with special educational needs. With our social service sector partners, we will deliver quality education to serve the varied needs of our students, optimise their potential, and nurture them to become independent and confident individuals. We will expand the School-to-Work transition programme to offer customised training to help more students secure employment.",
            "The scope of MOE’s work has expanded over the years to also cover pre-school and lifelong learning. Education is indeed a lifelong journey. It starts with the transmission of values, nurturing a curiosity to learn, and developing basic literacy and numeracy abilities. It continues through life with the acquisition of skills, knowledge, and experience. We will continue to closely partner parents, employers, and communities, to mould the future of Singapore."

MCI will also enhance Government communications and develop our libraries of the future.",
            "In a future increasingly shaped by digital technologies, Singapore must harness these changes to create opportunities for all. To that end, MCI will strengthen the Infocomm, Media, and Design (ICMD) sectors as growth multipliers for Singapore. We will implement the Infocomm Media Industry Transformation Map and deepen our capabilities in digital technologies, to grow the sector and create exciting new jobs. We will strengthen our media sector, so we can continue producing high-quality and inspiring content. We will forge ahead with the Design 2025 Masterplan to leverage design as an enabler of innovation and business transformation.",
            "A stronger ICMD sector will enable Singapore to accelerate digital transformation across the economy. We will expand our SMEs Go Digital programme to help our Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) ride this new wave of growth, and develop more targeted Industry Digital Plans. MCI will also launch the Open Innovation Platform to promote innovation and enterprise.",
            "We will prepare Singaporeans for a more vibrant, innovation-driven digital economy. We will ramp up the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) efforts to equip more Singaporeans with relevant skills. We will launch Digital Leadership programmes to groom the next generation of leaders in digital transformation.",
            "Singapore’s digital economy will be supported by world-class infrastructure and regulations. We will improve connectivity with the fifth generation of mobile technology (“5G”), and increase international data flows. We will ensure our regulations remain fit for purpose, including the Broadcasting Act and the Personal Data Protection Act.",
            "We will introduce a Digital Readiness Blueprint to enable all Singaporeans to fully participate in and benefit from digital opportunities in their everyday lives. We will do more to help disadvantaged and vulnerable communities, such as seniors and the low-income, use digital technology. We will look into developing a basic digital access package and setting up touchpoints in the community to provide basic one-on-one assistance on using digital devices and accessing digital services. We will help Singaporeans build information and media literacy skills so that they are able to discern, evaluate, and manage information in an increasingly complex digital environment. This will also allow Singaporeans to guard against the proliferation of falsehoods. We will also partner schools to equip students with coding, computational thinking, and digital making skills to develop the next generation of future-ready Singaporeans.",
            "We will continue to keep our cyberspace secure, for it is the foundation of a Smart Nation. Our National Cybersecurity Strategy sets out a comprehensive approach to do so. We will implement the Strategy to strengthen our critical information infrastructure and develop our cybersecurity ecosystem. We will also grow our international partnerships, as cyber threats do not respect geographical boundaries. We will continue to contribute to multilateral efforts to develop cyber norms and work with international partners to drive the development of cybersecurity standards for emerging technologies.",
            "Even as we encourage Singaporeans to embrace digital technologies to improve their lives, we must be on guard against threats and risks that propagate through such technologies. One such threat is deliberate online falsehoods, which threaten our multi-racial society by sowing discord, exploiting fault lines, and undermining public institutions. Apart from building Singaporeans’ info-literacy skills, we will leverage technology to swiftly respond to such threats, including building up the Government’s “Factually” platform.",
            "In light of an increasingly complex communications landscape, we will develop a Whole-of-Government Communications Roadmap, to transform government communications capabilities and leverage technology to improve the way the Government engages different age groups and communities. Public Service Broadcasting will focus on local content reflective of our rich cultural heritage, and delivering it through traditional and digital platforms.",
            "We will do more to engage Singaporeans better. Singaporeans at all levels will have an opportunity to voice their views and suggestions. We will continue to expand our pool of community, youth, and professional partners to widen our outreach to niche communities. We will also hold Listening Points in new areas to reach out to more segments of the population.",
            "Our libraries are national treasures, providing inclusive social spaces that foster lifelong learning. We will continue to build our Libraries of the Future, and conduct more programmes to make every Singaporean an active library user. The National Library Board mobile app already brings our libraries to our fingertips; we will continue to digitalise more library services so they are even more user-friendly. The National Archives celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. We will leverage this Golden Jubilee to help Singaporeans uncover gems in our collections and better understand our shared history.",
            "Next year we also commemorate the Singapore Bicentennial – the 200th anniversary of Sir Stamford Raffles’ landing on Singapore. Beyond looking at the 200 years from 1819, the Bicentennial will go back a further 500 years to the 14th century, to appreciate the context of Singapore’s evolution leading up to 1819. It is an opportunity to reflect on our rich history, appreciate our transformation into a global city, and reaffirm the values that will take us forward as a sovereign nation.

            "The financial sector is integral to Singapore’s growth as a competitive economy, a globally connected city, and a Smart Nation. As an integrated regulator and supervisor of the financial sector, MAS will safeguard the stability of Singapore’s financial system while ensuring that our regulatory frameworks remain supportive of innovation. MAS will work with the financial industry to advance FinTech innovations including those aimed at more convenient and lower-cost services for consumers, support Asia’s development while being a leading hub in global finance, and serving the growth of the Singapore economy.",

MAS will implement strategies to facilitate the growth of infrastructure financing, trade financing, and enterprise financing to support the region’s development. We will support industry efforts to increase insurance penetration in the region and catalyse effective disaster risk financing solutions. We will also strengthen our capital markets infrastructure to boost liquidity and price discovery in the foreign exchange, debt, and equity markets. MAS will anchor deeper asset management capabilities in Singapore, and implement the new Singapore Variable Capital Company structure to position Singapore as a global hub for fund management and domiciliation.",

With Singapore chairing ASEAN in 2018, MAS will work with fellow ASEAN member states and industry partners to pursue initiatives to achieve sustainable growth, boost economic resilience, and foster innovation in the region. MAS is also exploring innovative trade finance connectivity and cross-border real-time payment linkages with key partners in the region.",
            "MAS has been at the forefront globally in the use of regulatory sandboxes to encourage experimentation, and will enhance this approach. We will strengthen the payments infrastructure to enable real-time, convenient electronic payment transfers. MAS worked with the industry to roll out PayNow, enabling people to make inter-bank transfers conveniently and securely using just their mobile number or National Registration Identity Card (NRIC). PayNow will be extended to allow businesses to pay each other and receive payments from customers seamlessly, for efficiency gains and cost reduction.",

More Professional Conversion Programmes will be developed in various areas of specialisation, geared to emerging job roles. MAS will work with the Institute of Banking and Finance and tripartite partners to set up a dedicated career centre to provide job matching and placement assistance.",
            "MAS will continue to enhance its financial regulatory framework to help ensure stability amidst volatile global financial markets as well as new and emerging risks. We will strengthen cyber resilience across the industry and leverage technology to enhance our supervision and enforcement capabilities. MAS has implemented a 24/7 surveillance system to monitor cyber threats in the financial industry, and will strengthen capabilities in cyber intelligence and enhance platforms for information exchange on cyber incidents.",

            "Beyond setting rules, MAS is working to foster a culture that motivates ethical behaviour and responsible risk-taking in the financial industry. Culture and conduct weaknesses underlie many cases of misconduct, poor governance, and excessive risk-taking. MAS will propose guidelines to raise standards of conduct across the financial industry, and step up supervisory reviews relating to risk governance and culture in financial institutions."

Many companies, both foreign and local, recognise Singapore’s R&D value proposition and have deepened their R&D activities here. The Bloomberg Innovation Index has ranked Singapore as the third most innovative economy in the world, and the top innovation hub in our region. We have a vibrant and growing ecosystem of start-ups, venture capitalists, incubators, and accelerators, leveraging Singapore’s strengths as a financial centre and a trusted location to protect intellectual property.",

The RIE 2020 Plan is directing $19 billion between 2016 and 2020 towards four focus areas: Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering, Health and Biomedical Sciences, Urban Solutions and Sustainability, and Services and Digital Economy. These are areas of both national need and existing scientific strengths for Singapore. While continuing to invest in academic excellence, we have sharpened our focus in research funding towards creating and capturing value from our R&D investments. This includes investing in research translation, facilitating innovation, and supporting start-ups and growth companies. Stronger linkages across the value chain are enabling the flow-through of knowledge and technology from research into industry and community applications. The rapid growth in innovative high-technology enterprises in Singapore is encouraging more young Singaporeans to pursue careers built around science and technology.",

By aligning RIE’s efforts more closely to the Future Economy Council’s (FEC) efforts, we will accelerate the deployment of solutions to enable economic transformation. These include new programmes to support the transformation of our Maritime and Aviation sectors to sustain Singapore’s status as an international transport and logistics hub, and development of a more responsive and resilient next-generation energy grid architecture. We will expand our investment in digital and automation technologies including robotics and artificial intelligence. These investments support the FEC’s efforts to encourage adoption of digitalisation and automation across our economic sectors.",

SGInnovate, a new entity started in 2016, has been expanding its accelerator programmes to support start-ups and growth-stage companies in deep-technology areas. Working with economic agencies like Enterprise Singapore, it will support Smart Nation efforts in emerging sectors such as Smart Energy, Digital Manufacturing, Fintech, Digital Health, and the Internet of Things. Budding entrepreneurs are matched with mentors, introduced to venture capital firms, and will be able to access R&D talent. Together with other economic agencies, we will facilitate strategic partnerships among Singapore-based companies to expand their capabilities and help them access global markets.",

We will refresh our strategic investments in major research centres in our universities and in our CREATE (Campus for Research Excellence and Technology Enterprise) collaborations with international partners, and continue to position Singapore as a global node of scientific excellence. Our NRF Fellowships and Investigatorships continue to attract promising young scientists to conduct research in Singapore, and provide opportunities for established scientists to pursue ground-breaking research. Our Returning Singaporean Scientists scheme attracts overseas Singaporean scientists home to grow the core of Singaporean researchers, and eventually take up leadership positions here. In line with SkillsFuture, we will work with partner agencies and industry to increase the innovation and enterprise talent pool, identify key frontier skill sets in demand, and work with our Institutes of Higher Learning to train more Singaporeans for jobs in these fields.",

To achieve this, we are embarking on major shifts in our healthcare system to move Beyond Healthcare to Health, Beyond Hospital to Community, and Beyond Quality to Value; and to promote and enable Successful Ageing in Singapore.",
            "MOH's first priority is to help Singaporeans stay healthy. We have promoted healthier food and lifestyle choices, encouraged disease screening, and declared War on Diabetes. We will expand these efforts and embark on new ones to move towards the goal of developing health promoting communities. Singaporeans will be empowered through information, technology, and smart behavioural nudges to eat healthily, keep active and take charge of their health, while industries and employers will be encouraged to provide supportive environments for healthy behaviour. We will also explore measures to further discourage unhealthy habits, such as smoking and excessive sugar consumption.",
            "To continue to safeguard public health in Singapore in the face of increased globalisation and emergence of new diseases, MOH will enhance our surveillance, preparedness, and response on infectious diseases. The upcoming National Centre for Infectious Diseases will serve as a focal point for these efforts. MOH will also lead in the implementation of a National Anti-Microbial Resistance Plan to prevent the emergence and spread of drug-resistant micro-organisms.",
            "Even as we build more hospital capacity with the completion of Sengkang General and Community Hospitals this year, we need to strengthen our primary care foundation by building new polyclinics, expanding existing ones, and establishing more Primary Care Networks comprising General Practitioners. Our hospitals will also partner with primary care and community care providers to bring about seamless care for patients. A new Healthcare Services legislation will be enacted to enhance regulatory clarity, strengthen governance, and safeguard patient safety and welfare. The National Electronic Health Record will improve the continuity of care for patients.",
            "Beyond increasing capacity, we will transform care models. The new MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation will work with healthcare institutions to experiment with innovative and potentially game-changing concepts. New models will be tested, with successful ones scaled up. We will also deepen our efforts to develop Regional Health Systems, which will spearhead the development of new capabilities, such as community nursing and successful programmes that shift the nexus of care beyond the hospital to the community. We will selectively deploy regulatory sandboxes to facilitate experimentation in new services and innovative care models while ensuring patient safety.",
            "MOH will review healthcare financing policies to support new care models and to better integrate care in the community. This includes more targeted government subsidies to better direct support towards those in greater need, as well as timely and appropriate changes to MediShield Life and to Medisave usage and coverage.",
            "Beyond ensuring good quality care, we will strive towards helping Singaporeans make better choices. To support healthcare professionals, patients, and the public in making more informed and appropriate decisions, the Agency for Care Effectiveness will expand their range of education, advisory products, and programmes beyond Drug Guidances and Appropriate Care Guides. To encourage more appropriate consumption of healthcare, MOH will publish fee benchmarks for medical procedures and services and has also introduced co-payment requirements for new Integrated Shield Plan Riders.",
            "We will continue our push for productivity improvements. A new agency will be set up to consolidate the procurement and supply chain functions across our public healthcare clusters. This will bring about better economies of scale and enable us to develop new models and capabilities that improve efficiency and benefit patients. MOH is also working with public hospitals to share information and practices that can enhance patient outcomes while managing costs. Such a value-driven care approach would help raise and maintain clinical quality across our hospitals in a cost-effective manner.",
            "We will press on with the implementation of the Action Plan for Successful Ageing. This includes efforts to expand community-based care facilities and experiment with new forms of housing for more accessible care. We will develop social nodes in the community to bring active ageing, preventive health, functional health screening, and other programmes to the doorsteps of seniors. The formation of the Silver Generation Office and nationwide expansion of the Community Networks for Seniors will further facilitate better integration of health and social services, and encourage more Singaporeans to volunteer and contribute towards successful ageing efforts. We will complete the review of ElderShield and strengthen the social safety net for long-term care.",
            "MOH will continue to build a strong local pipeline of healthcare professionals. We will create good job opportunities for Singaporeans in the growing healthcare sector, and enable our healthcare workforce to stay relevant through skills upgrading. For nurses, who constitute the largest group in our healthcare workforce, we will invest in a comprehensive Continuing Education and Training system, and in particular, build up capabilities for nurse-led, community-based care.",
            "We will update and align our Health Information Technology (IT) Master Plan to our priorities. We will leverage new developments in data analytics, artificial intelligence, robotics and other technological fields to transform how we work and deliver care. We will also continue to invest in health and biomedical research that can yield benefits for Singaporeans and our healthcare system.",
            "The transformation of our healthcare system will only be possible with the combined efforts of public and private healthcare institutions, voluntary welfare organisations, and other agencies. It would require the involvement of patients, healthcare professionals, healthcare insurers, employers, and Government. MOH will facilitate participation and collaboration among all stakeholders.",
            "We are confident that our plans will help Singaporeans stay healthy and active at all ages, while ensuring that quality healthcare remains accessible, affordable, and sustainable. Together, we can achieve Better Health, Better Care and Better Life for all."

            ": In the coming years, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will continue to strengthen our partnership with the community in order to nurture resilient individuals, strong families, and a caring society.",
            "To give every child a good start in life, we will press on with the transformation of the early childhood sector, so that more families can benefit from accessible, affordable, and good quality early childhood services. We will expand full day preschool places to provide a place for every child who needs one. Two out of every three pre-schoolers will have a place in government or government-supported pre-schools by 2023, in centres run by Anchor Operators and Partner Operators, as well as MOE Kindergartens. To build a strong foundation for bilingual learning, we will also double the number of Anchor Operator pre-schools which offer Malay or Tamil as Mother Tongue Languages, in addition to Chinese.",
            "To support sustainable growth of this sector, the Early Childhood Development Agency will work closely with industry partners and the National Institute of Early Childhood Development to ensure that our early childhood educators have meaningful and rewarding careers. We will also make good use of training and technology to raise standards and productivity.",
            "For children from low-income families, we will develop a strong ecosystem of support through the KidSTART pilot. We will partner parents to enable their children to develop holistically in the familiar settings of their home and pre-school.",
            "We must continue to make Singapore one of the best places to build strong families and bring up children. Together with our community partners, we will foster a family-friendly environment, and share the joys of marriage and parenthood. We will provide marriage preparation and support programmes through our community partners, so that couples and families are equipped to build strong relationships. We will also continue to provide resources to support parents in caring for and bonding with their children.",
            "Even as we pursue these, we recognise that some marriages may not work out. Through the work of the newly-formed Committee to Review and Enhance Reforms in the Family Justice System, we will enhance the therapeutic and restorative approach in the family justice system, so as to reduce the negative impact on children arising from family break-up and divorce.",
            "Our network of Social Service Offices (SSOs) has brought help closer to those in need. We will continue to tackle our social challenges by enhancing social service delivery on the ground. Through the SSOs, we will strengthen our partnerships and processes across agencies and community partners, to provide more holistic, clientcentric support. We aim to help clients receive assistance and apply for multiple help schemes more conveniently, no matter which agency they first approach. We will also channel Government, private sector, and community resources to yield greater and more long-lasting impact. By significantly tightening processes and improving coordination, we will ease the burden on clients, and better help them to get back on their feet.",
            "We will support youth-at-risk with opportunities to succeed in life, by intervening more aggressively upstream, and adopting a more preventive, rehabilitative, and integrative approach towards youth-at-risk, youth offenders, and their families. The National Committee on Prevention, Rehabilitation and Recidivism, comprising Government agencies and community partners, will review the effectiveness of our approaches, identify new strategies, and drive greater coordination across the public, private, and people sectors.",
            "Through our new Integrated Service Providers, we will provide youth-at-risk and youth offenders with programmes that are better tailored to their needs and delivered with greater consistency. This will raise the quality of youth programmes, and better help our youth achieve positive outcomes in life.",
            "With SG Enable, we will continue to implement the Third Enabling Masterplan to empower persons with disabilities to live their lives to their fullest potential. For children with developmental needs, we will intervene early and tailor support services to best help them in their growing years. As persons with disabilities progress through different stages of life, we will provide more seamless support, such as by easing the transition from school to work. To enhance opportunities for employment and lifelong learning, we will prepare and equip persons with disabilities to be effective at the workplace, and work closely with employers to build an inclusive company culture. We will also support caregivers to ensure their well-being and peace of mind, with regard to the care of their loved ones.",
            "We will care for our seniors, who continue to enrich our society with their wisdom and experience. We will support and encourage Singaporeans to plan ahead to safeguard and unlock their assets with a Lasting Power of Attorney, in the event that they lose mental capacity. For those who have lost mental capacity, and have no family to help, we will empower credible and trustworthy members of the community to step in to support. In doing so, we hope that Singaporeans can enter their silver years with confidence and peace of mind.",
            "We will continue to enhance comprehensive support for children who experience abuse and neglect. This includes intervention to support families to make the home environment safer for children, and expanding foster care so that children who cannot be with their biological families can still grow up in a family environment. We will also explore how to further enhance kinship care arrangements, where children are cared for by relatives, and thus are able to remain more closely connected with their families.",
            "We will introduce legislation to protect vulnerable adults who are suffering from abuse, neglect, or self-neglect in their homes. Along with changes to the law, we will strengthen linkages across agencies and the community to support vulnerable adults and their families.",
            "Through the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), we will continue to develop the social service sector, as they are vital partners in our mission to uplift and protect vulnerable individuals and families. We will groom leaders and professionals, deepen skills and capabilities, and create more developmental pathways. We will also continue to strengthen the organisational capabilities of Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) through initiatives such as the VWOs-Charities Capability Fund.",
            "Over the years, VWOs, corporates, community organisations, social service professionals, and many Singaporeans have stepped forward to extend a helping hand to people in need. In line with the SG Cares movement, we will further nurture this spirit of giving. NCSS will work with VWOs to build the volunteer management capabilities of our VWOs, and better shape volunteer roles and opportunities so that volunteers can contribute meaningfully. We will also champion social innovation and enterprise, and enable more consistent and sustainable giving by individuals and corporates. These efforts will actualise and amplify the goodwill in society.",
            "Creating a more cohesive society is a continuous endeavour over the long-term. We invite all Singaporeans to partner us in this journey to strengthen our society and improve the lives of others, as we work towards a better future together."

            ": The Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth (MCCY) will focus on building a caring, cohesive, and confident nation that is enabled by an active citizenry and a vibrant arts and heritage, sports, community, and youth landscape. There are many challenges we will face as a country in the next chapter of our journey. These include economic and demographic challenges, which may affect social cohesion and harmony. To rise above these challenges, Singaporeans must have a strong sense of shared identity, trust and engage each other, and exercise their civic responsibilities for the common good. MCCY will do more to encourage these qualities, and grow a strong society.",
            "Our culture and heritage are important parts of what makes us Singaporean. This year, we launched the Our SG Heritage Plan, a long-term comprehensive national masterplan to safeguard and promote our shared heritage for future generations. We ratified the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage on 22 February 2018. As a Member State, we will work towards listing an element on the UNESCO Representative List that reflects our multicultural and multiracial makeup, resonates with Singaporeans, and helps build a greater sense of national identity. We will continue our conversations with the community to define the intangible aspects of our heritage. This demonstrates Singapore’s commitment to safeguard and promote our heritage, which is important to strengthen our identity as a nation. We will also make changes to the relevant legislation within the next two years to better support the preservation of our tangible and intangible heritage, and to safeguard our archaeological history more effectively.",
            "The arts scene is more vibrant today, with more Singaporeans recognising the value of the arts to the individual, community, and to Singapore society. We will continue to enrich and grow our arts scene, and support our artists in areas such as audience development, community arts, arts education, capability development, internationalisation, as well as research and documentation. We will also adopt the Tripartite Standard on Contracting with Self-Employed Persons in the arts and culture sector to promote fair and progressive employment practices. This will be complemented by the setting up of a national resource centre, to support freelancers in their efforts to excel and enjoy meaningful careers.",
            "Sport has the capacity to inspire and rally a nation. When we cheer on our athletes and celebrate their achievements, we reaffirm our identity as one people. Our contingents achieved their best away performances at the Southeast Asian Games and ASEAN Para Games in Malaysia in 2017, and put in commendable performances at the Commonwealth Games in Australia in April 2018. The Government is committed to supporting our athletes’ aspirations, and will continue to develop and enhance Singapore’s High Performance Sports system, in areas such as talent identification, coach development, and sports science and medicine capabilities. We will work with key sports stakeholders such as the Singapore National Olympic Council, Singapore National Paralympic Council, and the National Sports Associations, to prepare our athletes and rally the nation as One Team Singapore.",
            "A society is cohesive when its members respect one another as equals regardless of differences, and when it works for everyone and not just a few. We will continue to grow the common space for interactions and shared experiences, and promote equal access to arts and heritage, sports, and youth programmes such as ArtReach, SportCares Champions, Saturday Night Lights, and Youth Corps Singapore. We will expand the range of affordable quality sports programmes at ActiveSG centres, and build on the momentum of Get Active! Singapore celebrations, to encourage more Singaporeans to bond through sport. Using programmes such as BRIDGE (Broadening Religious/Racial Interaction through Dialogue and General Education), we will increase our support for community-led initiatives that deepen understanding on sensitive issues of race and religion.",
            "To further promote inclusivity, the Disability Sports Master Plan aims to expand access and opportunities for sports participation to all, regardless of abilities. We will launch two more inclusive gyms and more disability sports programmes, such as Wheelchair Tennis, in 2018. We will continue to grow awareness and outreach of disability sports through platforms such as the Inclusive Sports Festival, and partnerships with stakeholders like the Ministry of Education, Special Education schools, social service organisations, and other sports stakeholders.",
            "We embarked on the Youth Conversations to provide a platform for youth to engage one another and the Government, to build our future Singapore together. Youth Conversations provide opportunities for young Singaporeans to understand important issues, appreciate one another’s views, negotiate differences, and find new solutions together. We will design conversations around wide ranging issues such as preparing for jobs in the future economy, bridging social divides, and helping the underprivileged, using various modes of engagement to provide safe spaces for dialogue. Conversations will also be conducted online, to reach out to more youth, and enable them to build and sustain connections with one another. Through the National Youth Fund, we will also support youth who want to initiate projects together to benefit the community and bring Singapore forward.",
            "Communities that look out for and care for one another are the hallmark of a strong society. SG Cares seeks to have a person in every household who volunteers, making the values of care and contribution a norm. We will convene more platforms for givers, non-profits, and sector experts to build insights, co-create solutions, and achieve national impact together. As a start, we will provide greater support to local community stakeholders in Bedok and Jurong – community partners, religious organisations, schools, and merchants in the neighbourhood – to serve the needs of residents, and coordinate and mobilise resources. We will also encourage and support good neighbourliness through a whole-of-society approach, to strengthen a shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards the neighbourhood. This enhanced community model will complement efforts to strengthen social service delivery on the ground, and the expansion of the Community Networks for Seniors. A strong local ecosystem will support vulnerable families and enable our seniors who want to age in place to do so in the community.",
            "Seniors have much to offer. We want to engage them early and help them transit to new roles in the community as they retire. We will tap on their diverse experience and involve them in giving back to society through volunteerism. In the process, they can also grow their social networks and stay active and engaged.",
            "To meet the challenges of an ageing society, we launched Active Health, a national social movement to spur Singaporeans to take ownership of their health and wellness, and support one another in sustaining an active lifestyle. To kick-start their Active Health journey, Singaporeans can visit an Active Health Lab to have their baseline health indicators assessed, and choose from a wide range of ActiveSG programmes to get active together with family, colleagues, and friends. We will roll out four more labs at Bishan, Jurong East, Sengkang, and Woodlands Sports Centres, and two Mobile Labs this year. Working with partner organisations such as the Health Promotion Board, People’s Association, and healthcare providers, we will progressively expand outreach to more people across Singapore.",
            "A strong society is one that is caring, inclusive, and has a shared sense of past and future. A strong society is one where the Singapore spirit is strong, and where we work together to make Singapore a better home. In the face of a more complex and unpredictable future, we invite every Singaporean to build an even better Singapore together."
