            ": As announced in May, we are moving the public bus industry from the current privatised model to a Government Contracting Model.",
            "We have been studying this move as early as the Land Transport Master Plan in 2008. Under the current model, the public bus operators rely on their fare and non-fare revenues to pay for their operations and buy operating assets, such as buses. When fare revenues are uncertain, as it has been in recent years, operators may be reluctant to expand capacity ahead of demand, or to improve service levels beyond regulatory standards on their own accord. This was why the Government had to step in with the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP) in 2012 to quickly raise service standards and to add capacity, even as we worked towards a more sustainable bus industry model.",
            "Under the proposed Government Contracting Model, LTA owns the buses, plans the routes and engages private bus operators through competitive tenders to run the services. This will enable us to respond more quickly and effectively to changes in ridership and commuter needs. The model also allows for more operators, potentially even overseas ones, to compete for the contracts. Bus operators will need to compete on the basis of costs and service quality. Over time, this will lead to the provision of better bus services in a cost-competitive manner, thereby benefiting commuters.",
            "Mr Dhinakaran, Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Teo Siong Seng asked whether the Government is setting aside a budget for the new bus contracting model and how much the Government will subsidise bus operations. I think it is probably not in the Government's interest to reveal any budget that we may have set aside and how much we are prepared to subsidise before the tenders are issued and the returns are seen, as this may well skew the bids against us.",
            "The eventual amount of subsidy will crucially depend on whether fares and bus service standards are set realistically. Regardless of industry model, the cost of the overall bus system has to be paid for either by commuters in the form of fares, or taxpayers in the form of Government subsidies. There surely is no free lunch. Therefore, we have to strike the right balance. The Government is committed to ensure the affordability of public transport fares. However, regular fare adjustments are still necessary to ensure the overall financial sustainability of the public transport system.",
            "Likewise, new bus routes and higher service levels have to be assessed judiciously. Even today, we receive many requests to run bus routes that have low ridership. From the point of view of the select few who benefit, these bus routes are, of course, \"necessary\". But if we run too many of these routes throughout the system, either higher fares or more Government subsidies will be required.",
            "Mr Giam asked about how we intend to treat the current bus assets owned by the two incumbent public bus operators. We will discuss this issue as part of our negotiations with SBST and SMRT on the nine bus packages that they will continue to operate after 2016.",
            "Finally, Mr Giam may perhaps not be aware that we have already implemented the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF) starting with the Downtown Line last year, even before the announcement of the public bus contracting model. In fact, the Government Contracting Model for buses brings us closer to the NRFF, where the Government, instead of the operator, owns the operating assets and is responsible for major capital asset investments."

            ": Thank you, Madam. I have four supplementary questions, three of which are related to each other. First is how does the Government ensure that there is genuine contestability and competition among the operators so that they will be kept on their toes to constantly improve service quality and efficiency? How will it ensure that the new model will not see the same few players dominating the market?",
            "Secondly, how will the Government ensure that it is easy for new players to enter the market and also easy for non-performing operators to exit?",
            "Thirdly, how many new players does the Government plan to allow into this market?",
            "Fourthly, does the Government have plans to set up a corporatised, not-for-profit entity like a National Transport Corporation or Transport for London, that manages the assets in the day-to-day operations of the bus network, while leaving LTA to play the regulatory and planning role, as this could lead to greater efficiency and accountability and minimise the risk of regulatory capture?"
          ]
        },
        {
          "speaker": "Mr Lui Tuck Yew",
          "content": [
            ": Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Perhaps, I will start with a reply to how we would encourage new players to enter the market and then I will go into the specifics of contestability and how many new players.",
            "One important thing is to lower barriers to entry, which is why we decided that as we embarked into the Government Contracting Model that it would be best for LTA to purchase and own the buses. For each package, you may be looking at perhaps 400 to 500 buses. For 400 buses, you may be looking at $150 million and $200 million dollars – quite a significant capital investment if it has to be invested by a new player.",
            "We do not want to preclude the possibility of operators that are already in the local market running private buses quite efficiently who may be prepared to make a bid for one of these packages, provided we lower the barriers to entry.",
            "How do we ensure genuine contestability? Well, to have as many bidders as possible, to make the bidding as simple as it can be so that your evaluation is as straightforward as possible.",
            "There is another reason why we have decided to purchase and provide the buses. Because we intend to have a five-plus-two option – five years, with the option for an operator, if he is successful and performing well, to extend for another two years. So, this is five-plus-two. After that, it is re-tendered.",
            "Obviously, the lifespan of a bus extends well beyond the five or seven years. If an operator were to bring in their own buses, then the challenge is how do they cost this into their bid? Do they bring in second-hand buses, meaning the lifespan would run out by the time they finish; or do they bring in new buses knowing that this could disadvantage operators from certain countries, for example, the European countries, because they are on the different side of the road? And so the buses that they use here may well not be so suitable if they were to use them in some other place, like back in their home countries.",
            "So, genuine contestability comes about from lowering the barriers to entry, making sure that you have got competitive bids, structuring the tender so that it is as clear and as simple as possible so that when you evaluate, you can evaluate across a common base line, so that the potential operators do not need to price in too many areas of uncertainty.",
            "As to how many new players, we are actually open to this. The initial part is that three of the 12 packages will be put up for tenders and we will then negotiate with SBST and SMRT to run the remaining nine packages. Over the longer period, the intent is to put up all 12 packages for tender. Whether we continue to have two, three or more players will depend on the returns that come in.",
            "On the not-for-profit entity and whether there should be a corporate player to own the buses, we do not see a necessity for that at this point in time. Basically, it is really the same model that we are trying to adopt as for rail. In rail, we provide the infrastructure, we provide the first set of rolling stock and the operator then subsequently buys it over at the right point in time. The bus industry had been operating on quite a different model in the past because the operators used to have to pay for the depots, buses and everything. What we are trying to do here in the Government Contracting Model is to provide as much as possible the same kind of support to the bus industry as we did to the rail industry in the early years."

          "speaker": "Mr R Dhinakaran",
          "content": [
            ": Madam, I thank the Minister. I would like to ask a supplementary question. How do you plan to structure the subsidies for various bus route segments, and whether this kind of subsidy system will be transparent before the tender takes place?"

        {
          "speaker": "Mr Lui Tuck Yew",
          "content": [
            ": First, I thank the Member for the very perceptive question. It is not clear at this point in time that all the packages will require subsidy or how much the subsidy is going to be. Essentially, what will happen is that the operators will bid, most likely, on the cost to run a bus on a per-km basis. We may contract them to run, for example, a million km. So, there is a certain price that we will have to pay them for doing so.",
            "Under the gross cost model which we are adopting, all the fare revenues will be collected and it will come to the Government. Of course, if the fare revenues do not match what we have to pay to the operator, there will be a need for a subsidy. Or if the fares do not go up enough in subsequent years, even as the cost may go up based on what is built into the tender returns, then there would be a need for a subsidy. So, we do not yet know at this point in time.",
            "What we will know when the tender returns come in is that we have asked the potential bidders to run a package of routes that we are already operating today. That package of routes, based on the number of buses, frequency and service quality, will let us know what is the revenue that is collected. We will also know how much we have to pay each of the bidders and we can then match the revenue collected for this package of routes with what we have to pay to the successful tenderer. That will determine whether we need to provide a subsidy or not. Hopefully, that results in a higher degree of transparency in terms of how we award this, based on a competitive tender."

            ": The Minister discussed eventual subsidies. How will the Minister ensure that this endeavour is financially sustainable in the long term? Lower fares could mean higher subsidies. How will the Minister attempt to ensure higher productivity among service providers to allow for affordable fares and, therefore, sustainable subsidies in the long term?"

          "speaker": "Mr Lui Tuck Yew",
          "content": [
            ": Mdm Speaker, I want to thank the Member for a very important question because I think financial sustainability of the industry is something that we have to pay a great deal of attention to.",
            "I would look at it in several ways. One is to make sure that we judiciously assess all the requests that come in, whether it is to operate new routes or to improve service standards. Because if you operate more and more new routes and the ridership is low, well, the Government and indirectly the taxpayers take on the burden of making sure it is financially sustainable. If you run too many new routes where the ridership is low, then subsidies will, of course, have to go up because the operating cost will exceed the fare revenue that you can collect. That is number one – to make sure that you are quite careful about what you agree to in terms of the new routes. So, we have LTA now working out on a framework that we can perhaps all agree on, on what is the threshold that a new route ought to meet before we can agree for it to be operated, or, if you are prepared to test the new route for a certain number of months and it does not cross the threshold, then I think we will have to sometimes make a painful decision to cut that route and eliminate it.",
            "The second has to do with service standards. If you run a service where the headway is one bus every 10 minutes, the cost is less than if you were to run it every five minutes. We all know that. The more frequently you run the buses, the higher the cost will be. So, we again have to be quite judicious when we raise service standards to make sure that we do not over-step and, hence, ultimately, result in a much bigger bill in terms of the subsidies that we have to pay.",
            "I think the third thing is really to look at regular fare increases. From the middle of the last decade, I think we have actually allowed operating cost to well exceed the fare increases that were taking place each year. For example, from 2005 until 2012, when we had the Fare Review Mechanism Committee's work and we suspended any fare increases thereon, 2005 to 2012, the annual fare increase was, on average, 0.3%. We know, of course, that wage increases were much higher than this 0.3%; likewise, fuel cost. So, there will be a need for us to make sure that we have regular fare increases of the right quantum. In this, we will continue to be guided over the next few years by the formula that has been established by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee led by Mr Richard Magnus, as well as the decision that the Public Transport Council will make with regard to each and every fare increase."

            ": Mdm Speaker, Mr Teo Siong Seng has asked whether the contracting model which the Government has adopted for public bus services will be adopted for other public services, such as the MRT and healthcare.",
            "The contracting model where the Government owns and pays for infrastructure and private sector operators bid for service contracts is relevant for public transport. As pointed out earlier by the Minister for Transport, we have moved in a similar direction for the MRT with the implementation of the New Rail Financing Framework for the Downtown Line.",
            "The contracting model is one of a range of possible public-private partnership models that can be adopted, depending on the specific circumstances and our objectives in each case.",
            "In healthcare, the Government retains the role of the dominant provider of hospital beds, about 85%, so as to influence the supply of hospital beds and better manage cost increases. Through this approach, the Government is also able to set a benchmark for pricing for the private sector. However, since the 1980s, the Government has also corporatised the public sector hospitals and other healthcare institutions. This has enabled efficiency gains and helped keep costs down for patients and taxpayers.",
            "Moreover, a contracting model is in place in the nursing home sector. The Government funds the development costs and owns the buildings which house our nursing homes but leases them out through a competitive bidding process. The Government selects the operator who can best provide good quality care at affordable fees. This helps to reduce the barriers to entry into the nursing home sector and gives access to a wider range of interested operators, including voluntary welfare organisations, which provide nursing home care that is partially subsidised through charitable donations.",
            "Another model of public-private partnership is in NEWater and desalination plants. The private sector operators are able to take on the upfront costs and risks in constructing, owning and operating these plants, with the Government purchasing water according to a pre-negotiated pricing structure. This provides room for private sector ventures and innovation and yet allows us to obtain competitive prices for water.",
            "In summary, the model adopted in each area will differ according to specific circumstances and objectives. We will continue to have a mix of business models that allows the Government, where appropriate, to leverage on the strengths of the private sector to provide high standards of public services at affordable cost."

            ": Mdm Speaker, SingPass is a password system for the public to identify themselves when using various Government e-services. Launched in 2003, SingPass is part of the e-Government masterplan initiatives spearheaded by MOF and Infocomm Development Authority (IDA).",
            "Since its launch in 2003, various security improvements have been implemented. For example, since September 2012, the SingPass system requires users to enter strong passwords when the password is changed. Strong passwords must include a combination of letters and numbers and contain eight to 24 characters. For Government e-services that require online payment, users must further authenticate themselves using the systems put in place by their financial institutions.",
            "In November 2007, SingPass introduced the Immediate Reset (IMR) feature. This allowed users to reset their password online immediately. The need for IMR arose when users wanted to use an e-service but realised they forgot their password. Before IMR was introduced, SingPass users could only reset their passwords at the physical SingPass counters located at CPF Board offices or at the community centres located across the island. Alternatively, they could submit an online request to reset their SingPass and a password would be mailed to their registered addresses within four working days.",
            "To activate the IMR, the user must login using SingPass and provide (a) the answers to two security questions; and (b) his mobile number. When using IMR to reset the password, the user will be required to: (a) provide his Name, NRIC and the Date of Issue of his NRIC, and (b) answer the two security questions. A one-time password would then be sent to his mobile number. This one-time password enables the user to set a new password. After the password is reset through IMR, a notification letter would be sent to the user's registered address to inform him this had been done.",
            "On Monday, 2 June 2014, IDA was informed that the SingPass helpdesk received 11 calls from different members of the public reporting that they received a SingPass Reset Notification Letter even though they did not request for any password reset. Due to the alertness of these 11 SingPass users, IDA was able to initiate an immediate investigation. IDA detected that the one-time passwords of these 11 accounts were sent to a single mobile number at or around the same day. Further checks revealed that 1,560 accounts had also been linked to a small number of mobile phone numbers. As a precaution, IDA immediately ordered that these SingPass accounts should be deactivated. Affected users were notified by a letter via urgent delivery to their registered addresses. IDA has also alerted and has been working with other agencies on the affected SingPass accounts. As reported, investigations revealed that six fraudulent transactions involving work permit applications were made from three affected SingPass accounts. MOM has since contacted the affected users and cancelled the applications involved. Should other fraudulent transactions be found, Government agencies will contact those affected.",
            "Arising from the incident, IDA also initiated a further round of review of the different layers of protection at the network and application level. The system was also scanned for any undetected vulnerabilities. No vulnerability was uncovered. The perpetrator may have obtained the users' SingPass credentials through other means.",
            "One possibility is the widespread use of simple passwords. For example, in October 2013, Adobe reported that its system was hacked, leading to the disclosure of millions of user accounts. When security experts examined the published passwords, it found millions of users were using weak passwords such as \"123456\", or the word \"password\". Another possibility is that malware was installed in users' computers, thus allowing the perpetrator to see the user's keystrokes.",
            "Members have asked how security can be improved. My Ministry will work with MOF and IDA to further enhance security measures for SingPass and introduce stronger authentication using second-factor authentication (2FA) for e-services involving sensitive data or transactions.",
            "Besides 2FA, IDA will also further enhance SingPass. In April this year, a new contract was awarded to implement a new SingPass system by Q3 2015. The new SingPass system will require even stronger passwords. We are also looking into allowing users to define their own usernames instead of the current NRIC or FIN number. In addition, the new SingPass will come with more advanced analytics capability to identify anomalies in login transaction patterns so as to mitigate any potential security risks. Agencies will be required to implement 2FA for e-services involving sensitive data or transactions. More details on the 2FA implementation will be available in the later part of the year. IDA will work with the SingPass operator to improve the processes in handling customer queries and helpdesk services provided to SingPass users.",
            "We are also exploring mandating more frequent password changes for SingPass accounts. This may mean a slight increase in the number of cases where users cannot immediately use some e-services because they forgot their password. We seek the public's understanding and patience for this. These additional authentication steps will allow for greater peace of mind when performing sensitive online transactions.",
            "While IDA enhances the security at the SingPass end, we also need the assistance of Singaporeans to secure their own systems. In particular, malware can disclose even strong passwords to perpetrators. Hence, users need to maintain basic computer hygiene practices, such as making sure that their computer software and anti-virus software are always updated.",
            "Over the years, the Singapore Government has also stepped up efforts to foster better cyber security practices of businesses and individuals. IDA has partnered the industry through the setting up of the Cyber Security Awareness Alliance and embarked on various cyber-security awareness and outreach activities. My Ministry will continue to work with IDA and all Government agencies to improve IT security awareness of our citizens. This year, Madam, IDA will be partnering with the National Crime Prevention Council to produce an episode of CrimeWatch enacting a cybercrime case."

We have a stringent selection and screening system in place for teachers, including an interview by a panel of experienced senior educators. Besides intellectual and interpersonal qualities, individuals are also assessed for their motivation, sense of responsibility, understanding of accountability and commitment to the ethos of the teaching profession.",
            "When educators formally enter the service, there are a number of platforms to remind them of the values and beliefs that define the teaching profession and to reinforce the expectations of educators' conduct. These platforms include induction briefings for Beginning Teachers, discussion of case studies at the school level for all teachers and milestone programmes for key personnel.",
            "In 2012, in consultation with the fraternity, MOE codified the values, beliefs and conduct expected of educators. The Code of Professional Conduct for Educators was shared with all educators in 2013 to provide guidance on how educators are expected to carry themselves. Importantly, the Code sets out the boundaries educators are to observe in their relationship with students. Using the Code, school leaders have continued to conduct regular conversations with their staff to deepen the ethos of the profession.",
            "Despite these efforts, some educators have transgressed and fallen short of the standards of behaviour expected of them. The teaching fraternity has expressed outrage at these cases. MOE takes a very serious view of such misconduct by educators. My instruction is that if there is any complaint of improper behaviour, each and every case must be thoroughly investigated and, where there is evidence of violation of the Code or of criminal behaviour, the officer involved will be dealt with severely.",
            "MOE and the teaching fraternity are determined to uphold the trust and confidence that parents and the community have in our educators. MOE will work with schools to intensify the communication and engagement with teachers on the Professional Code of Conduct, make explicit the professional boundaries that must not be breached in educators' interactions with students, as well as step up vigilance to safeguard and protect our students.",
            "MOE is also going through the past cases of such incidents to draw relevant lessons from these.",
            "Students need not and should not be passive victims. Our schools teach them their right to safety and protection so that they can recognise unacceptable behaviour and seek help. At the Primary level, students are taught how to recognise abuse, to identify types of behaviour that are of concern or are socially unacceptable and how to seek help. At the Secondary level, students are taught what constitutes sexual grooming, how to protect themselves from others with malicious intent and help-seeking skills.",
            "We also seek the support of parents. Your close relationship and conversations with your children may enable early signs of problems faced by them to be detected for early intervention. We share your concern to ensure that your children are protected from sexual predators.",

We are deeply disappointed with the cases of misconduct that have happened. While we cannot completely prevent human failings, I want to assure Members that we do not tolerate such wrong-doers. Whenever we uncover any case of sexual misconduct between educators and students, they will be thoroughly investigated and the transgressors will be severely dealt with."

Jurong View Secondary School, for example, offers recreational football and badminton as CCAs, and St Hilda's Secondary School offers recreational volleyball and netball as CCAs.",
            "Beyond CCA, many schools offer enrichment programmes in sports and the arts that provide students with quality exposure but which do not culminate in competitions or performances. In certain CCAs, particularly those related to music and dance, public performances are useful platforms to enrich the experiences of students, helping them to develop confidence and a mindset of excellence.",

Earlier, schools had received recognition in the form of awards for aesthetics, uniformed groups, sports and academic value-added. From 2014, MOE has simplified the recognition system and these awards have been removed. Instead, the emphasis is on recognition of school's quality practices in delivering a holistic education, such as the best practice award for Character and Citizenship Education. Revisions have also been made to the Singapore Youth Festival since 2013 to better emphasise the process of learning and enjoyment of the arts.",
            "MOE will continue to work closely with schools to strike a good balance for students' holistic development. While schools do strive to meet students' diverse needs by providing a range of CCAs, it is not feasible for every CCA to be in every school. We recognise and we encourage parents, students and schools to keep the channels of communication open as they monitor students' development through the different learning activities so that they benefit from a well-balanced education."

We will make sure that there is always a flat that you can afford, at least within your budget.

            ": Madam, the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) was introduced in 2007 – that was seven years ago – to enhance selected HDB precincts at the block and the neighbourhood level, for the benefit of the residents. These include physical improvements, such as drop-off porches and communal facilities like precinct pavilions. As older towns have greater need for such upgrading, we give priority to those built before December 1989. Those which have already undergone the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP), Interim Upgrading Programme (IUP) or IUP Plus are also excluded from the NRP.",
            "Based on this set of criteria, 187,000 flats are eligible for NRP. Of these, 100 NRP projects have been selected so far. When completed, these projects will benefit residents in 140,000 flats, or 75% of the eligible flats. So, we are at the third-quarter mark.",
            "Our residents have responded to NRP positively. Many participated actively in the consultation process, giving us useful ideas and suggestions on the improvements that can be made to their neighbourhood through the upgrading programme. We are very encouraged by their strong support.",
            "Now that we have crossed the three-quarter mark, it is timely to review the selection criteria. We understand that residents in blocks built just after 1989 may feel that their blocks are also ageing but they have just missed out on NRP and they wish that NRP can also be extended to them. I think this is understandable.",
            "So, we will review the selection criteria and see how the NRP can be extended also to blocks built in the early 1990s. If and when we do make such an extension, we will give priority to towns which have not benefited from MUP or IUP, like the one in the Member's constituency."

In my reply, let me first say that the total number of PRs in Singapore in 2013 or in any year, is not the appropriate population to base the query or the answers on, for the simple reason that that number includes individuals who are not liable for NS. For example, they include female PRs and first generation PRs. It also includes male PRs who have already completed their NS and/or those who have not reached the age of 18 years to serve full-time NS. But I understand what the query is, so I will give the answer to them.",

Over the past five years, about 7,200 males who had become PRs under the sponsorship of their parents, what we term as second generation PRs who are liable for NS, were enlisted for and served NS. So, over the last five years, 7,200 males. Over the same five-year period, about 2,600 second generation PR males renounced their PR status, prior to serving NS.

But, at the same time, you also do not want to prevent access to this kind of credit for those borrowers who cannot normally access the type of credit you can get from banks and financial institutions. The Committee will have a wide mandate and, in fact, if Members have suggestions or concerns, they should feel free to send their suggestions and comments to MinLaw for the Committee to look at."

I would like to just point out an example in the UK, where in 2008, they introduced the Dormant Bank and Building Society Act which gives the government the right to collect and distribute unclaimed money from dormant accounts after 15 years for the benefit of the community while protecting the rights of customers to reclaim the money by setting aside a pot of funds in case these account holders come forward to claim their money back. They have implemented this over the last six years to great success, releasing a lot of funds, more than £600 million, to the Reclaim Fund Limited, which funds charitable causes and is still able to fulfil account holders who step forward after 15 years to claim back their monies. So, would the Government consider a similar legislation for Singapore?"

For example, Germany does not have it; Hong Kong does not have and neither do we. But there are jurisdictions with dormant account laws and, typically, these dormant account laws, the focus is on protecting the owners of the fund and removing the burden from the financial institutions in managing these funds.",
            "The dormant accounts are usually untouched for several years – 10, 15 years or more. In many instances where they have these laws, when the funds are unclaimed, they are, in fact, transferred to the national treasury. The UK is an exception where they allow some funds, not everything, some funds to be transferred over to a spending account which are then used to provide funding for some charities.",

To help keep medicines affordable for patients, our public healthcare institutions tender jointly for the majority of their drugs in bulk to enjoy economies of scale. Savings are reflected in the overall pricing of medicines sold to patients in the public healthcare institutions.",

These are drugs on the Standard Drugs List (SDL) and the Medication Assistance Fund (MAF). Some drugs are subsidised at 50% off the non-subsidised prices, other drugs are priced at no more than $1.40 for a week's supply. The MAF helps lower to middle income patients who require relatively more expensive drugs, such as those for treatment of cancer, with up to 75% subsidy.",

In April this year, 13 new drugs were added into the SDL and MAF, including those used in the treatment of childhood leukaemia and rheumatoid arthritis. We are further enhancing drug subsidies for Singaporeans. From 1 January 2015, lower to middle income subsidised patients at the Specialist Outpatient Clinics and polyclinics will receive 75% subsidy, up from the current 50%, for their subsidised drugs.

For households without any income, the Annual Value (AV) of their residence is taken into consideration as a proxy of their means.",

            "Over the past six months, the Committee examined testimonies from 323 witnesses. It offered to interview all 57 foreign workers who were to be repatriated, and interviewed the 20 who accepted the offer. The Committee visited the scene of the riot, foreign worker dormitories and other places where foreign workers congregate during their days off work. It also conducted open hearings lasting 24 days and heard testimonies from 93 witnesses.",
            "The COI submitted its report to me on 27 June. The report was made public on 30 June and my Ministry also sent the report to Members of this House via e-mail on the same day. The COI report describes what happened that night and analyses factors that contributed to the riot. It also makes several important recommendations and observations to improve the management of such incidents and to reduce the risk of such incidents recurring.",
            "I would like to put on record my appreciation of the Committee's hard work in undertaking an open, searching, thorough and comprehensive Inquiry. I also thank the team of investigators, legal officers and civil servants that supported the COI, as well as witnesses who gave evidence at the inquiry.",
            "Let me first summarise the COI's key findings before providing the Government's response to the COI's recommendations.",
            "The COI found that the riot was triggered by a fatal road traffic accident and that the victim's own actions were primarily responsible for the accident. The victim was intoxicated, had lost his balance and had fallen under the bus while running in the bus driver's blind spot. At the time of the accident, the time-keeper was neither on the bus nor near it.",
            "The COI concluded that the primary or triggering cause of the riot was the occurrence of this fatal accident. However, a confluence of other factors fuelled its subsequent escalation.",
            "First, the COI attributed the escalation of the riot to the crowd's misperception that the accident was caused by the bus driver and the time-keeper. The crowd also misperceived the actions of the first responders from Police and SCDF, whom the crowd saw as protecting the bus driver and the time-keeper instead of arresting them.",
            "Second, the COI's view is that some of the workers at the scene that night could have carried a \"cultural psychology\" of \"retributive justice\" that spurred them to take the law into their own hands.",
            "Finally, the COI assessed that alcohol was a major contributory factor to the nature and escalation of the riot.",
            "The COI had also carefully examined other possible causes of the riot. Based on the evidence gathered, the COI concluded that the riot was not a result of dissatisfaction among foreign workers with their employment and living conditions in Singapore. Nor was the riot premeditated or planned. It was also not related to ethnic or any endemic form of discrimination.",
            "The COI pointed out that while the riot was a shock to many Singaporeans, it was not as severe as many others that had happened in other parts of the world. There was no loss of life, no prolonged fighting between Police and the rioters, and it was dispersed relatively quickly. The riot remained contained in a small area. Arson of private property and looting did not occur. No shots were fired by the Police, and neither tear gas nor water cannon was used on the rioters.",
            "The COI thus concluded that the overall outcome of the SPF response was good, but it would have been better had it not been for the overturning and burning of Police cars, ambulances and emergency vehicles.",
            "Twenty-five people were arrested at the scene that night. More than 400 persons were called up for subsequent further investigations. Eventually, 25 persons were charged, 57 were repatriated and 213 warned and given advisories. To update Members, of the 25 charged, 14 have been convicted and sentenced, the most recently this morning. Eight of these 14 have completed their sentences and have also been repatriated. The cases of the other 11 charged are still in progress.",
            "On the Home Team's response that night, the COI commended the SCDF officers for performing their duties well. The officers demonstrated quick thinking and common sense in departing from standard operating procedures to adapt to the changing needs on the ground. The COI also assessed the Police's overall response to be relatively swift and efficient. In the first phase – which was the initial response and extrication of the deceased's body and the evacuation of the driver and time-keeper – the responding officers did a commendable job of handling the situation.",
            "The COI was of the view that during the second phase, from 10.15 pm to 10.45 pm, while the ground commander felt that his best course of action was to hold his position until the arrival of the SOC, this should have been re-evaluated when the SOC was late in arriving, as the situation on the ground was changing and the response should have been adjusted accordingly.",
            "The COI's view was that there were opportunities for Police to intervene and take decisive action during this period from 10.15 pm to 10.45 pm. The COI stated that the rioters were destroying property and pelting the officers with objects, but the COI did not agree that it was a life-threatening situation, or that the officers would have been in severe danger had they moved in to stop and arrest the rioters at that time.",
            "The COI's analysis will be useful for Police's review of their doctrines and procedures, and provide inputs for Police's scenario-based training for dealing with public order incidents. These will help our officers and commanders hone their incident management skills. The COI arrived at its assessment based on a reconstruction of all available information collected after the riot by a team of investigators.",
            "On the other hand, on the night of the riot itself, as commanders and officers arrived at the scene as quickly as they could, they faced a highly charged and rapidly evolving situation. They made their decisions in the heat of the action, and under time pressure, based on the information they had available. The Police Divisional Commander who assumed incident command arrived on the scene at 10.11 pm. A few minutes after that, the rioters started flipping cars over and setting them ablaze with the first at 10.28 pm. The commanders and officers that night did not have the benefit of hindsight. Their decisions and actions have thus to be evaluated in that context.",
            "Mdm Speaker, it is not always possible to take the analyses done after the fact and substitute them for the judgement that the commanders and officers had to make on the ground that night. We will not be able to know definitively what the outcome would be if a different course of action had been taken during this phase, given the emotional crowd which was volatile and prone to misperceptions.",
            "Mdm Speaker, the commanders and officers that night did the best they could in the circumstances they faced, with the information they had on hand. Although there was destruction and damage to emergency vehicles, the riot was brought fully under control within two hours of the initial accident, contained within the immediate location, without loss of life or serious injury, and without the use of lethal force, including firearms. The area was re-opened to people and traffic by early the next morning, a few hours later.",
            "Mdm Speaker, a riot on the streets of Singapore is unacceptable. We have to take preventive action to minimise the likelihood of such a riot occurring and improve our capability to deal effectively with a riot if one does occur. Anyone who takes part in a riot must know that he will be dealt with firmly in accordance with the law.",
            "The COI made eight recommendations under two main categories – Strengthening the Home Team and Measures to Manage Congregation Areas. The COI's recommendations have provided an independent perspective of the measures necessary to minimise the likelihood of a riot and to better prepare ourselves to respond to any such incident.",
            "The Government accepts all of the COI's recommendations. The COI's recommendations address weaknesses and areas that we have to improve on, provide validation of several of our on-going plans which address the COI's concerns, sharpen our focus on what the priorities should be, and provide impetus for us to do more in certain areas and to implement them sooner. We have also not waited for the COI's report to act, but have implemented various improvements since the riot on 8 December, some in the days immediately following the incident. I will now address the action the Government is taking on the security-related aspects of the COI's recommendations. My colleague, the Minister for Manpower, will address the foreign manpower issues after my statement.",
            "In making recommendations on the Home Team's response to public order incidents, the COI took into account how SPF's focus and resourcing had evolved with Singapore's security needs. From the mid-1970s, Singapore witnessed a rapid reduction in the number of public order incidents. Consequently, SPF gradually shifted its focus and resources from riot control to other priorities, such as crime prevention and community policing. In 1983, the number of riot control troops was reduced from 12 to eight, and from 63 to 46 officers per troop.",
            "The SOC was established in 1992, and, after 2001 in particular, became a dual-response force for anti-terrorism, in addition to public order incidents. In 2004, the size of each SOC troop was reduced from 46 to 35 officers, but this was balanced with more intensive training and by improvements in equipment and technology.",
            "The COI's view is that SPF's progressive shift of resources was a positive development. However, the COI's view is that, given the riot, Police must re-assess the likelihood of having to deal with large-scale public order incidents and strengthen the ability of its forces to do so.",
            "Let me come to each of the COI's recommendations.",
            "The COI's first recommendation is to improve Command, Control and Communications, or C3 capabilities, to help ground officers build a better picture of the ground situation, especially in rapidly changing scenarios.",
            "This is an important area that needs to be improved. Police have an on-going programme, started a few years ago, for a major upgrade of its C3 systems. Two key projects are now near completion and ready to be commissioned this year. A new Combined Operations Room will be ready in end 2014. It will be equipped with tools to track the deployment of Police resources, as well as dashboards and information management systems for improved awareness of the ground situation.",
            "The new Police C3 system is also targeted to enter service in end 2014. It will bring more advanced communications, imaging and mobile computing technology to officers at the frontline, through mobile devices with data and voice communications. The on-scene ground commander will be able to receive collated information pushed to him from the Combined Operations Room. This will help him to build a better picture of the situation to improve his decision-making. The new Combined Operations Room and C3 system will strengthen Police's capability for incident management, and to marshal and deploy forces better to deal with rapidly developing situations.",
            "Police have also started trials for body-worn and vehicle-mounted cameras. All Police fast response cars will be equipped with cameras by end 2015. The streaming of live video from vehicle-mounted cameras will help to establish a real-time situation picture that both frontline responders and operations centres can use. The cameras will also capture evidence for post-event investigation and the identification of perpetrators.",
            "Police are also studying how the Combined Operations Room can make good use of publicly posted messages and images on the Internet or social media, as these can provide early indications and valuable information on a developing public security situation. This will also enable Police to quickly clarify and dispel any rumours or untruths, which can otherwise spread very quickly and create alarm or undesirable reactions.",
            "The second recommendation is to appropriately train and equip frontline officers to respond to public order incidents.",
            "Police will review what further capabilities our frontline officers need as first responders to deal with public order incidents. This will include a review of the training and equipping of officers. As our frontline officers have multiple policing duties, we will have to tailor their capability and training at a level appropriate for first responders and their mission. Should there be a large-scale public order incident that frontline officers, with their training and equipment, cannot fully deal with on their own, they will have to contain it, and call upon fully-trained SOC anti-riot troopers to quell it. I will speak next about how the SOC will be upgraded to respond more quickly and decisively.",
            "The third recommendation of the COI is to increase the SPF's manpower resources, including the Special Operations Command, so that they can better manage mass congregation areas, such as Little India, and be ready to deal with large-scale public order incidents. The COI also said that, however, quality rather than quantity should be the major consideration in augmenting the force.",
            "We will increase the size and capability of the SOC. In fact, we will double it. We need such a specially trained and equipped force to deal with large-scale public order incidents and the heightened terrorism threat, as well as to manage more mass events that require high-level security.",
            "Currently, the SOC deploys two Police Tactical Troops (PTTs) on round-the-clock standby duty. We intend to increase the number of troops from eight to 12 so that we can put a third SOC troop on standby all the time. This additional troop will be configured for rapid deployment on lighter and more mobile platforms. We will also increase the number of officers in each troop from 35 to 44, and provide them with additional equipment to improve their sense-making and operational capabilities. This will enable each troop to deal more effectively with a wider range of situations and crowd-size. In total, we will add 300 officers to the SOC, doubling its current strength of deployable frontline troopers. We will commence the build-up immediately and progressively build up its capabilities over the next two to three years.",
            "On overall Police manpower, between 2008 and 2014, more than 1,000 new posts have been added to support new initiatives, such as frontline Community Policing, Safer Roads and investigations. More than 97% of these additional posts have been filled. Overall, Police have increased its headcount by about 15% over the past 10 years from about 9,000 to about 10,300 officers. Police require more posts for new frontline demands, such as a new Police Division Headquarters and two new Neighbourhood Police Centres, in line with shifts in our population. At the same time, Police will continue to review their structures and processes so that officers can be more effectively and productively deployed to where they are most needed.",
            "To continue to attract and retain good officers, Police have enhanced their employment terms and provided more upgrading and education opportunities for in-service officers. SPF has also raised the retirement age of uniformed officers from 50 to 55, and re-employed more retired officers. More civilian officers have also been recruited to take on specialised roles, for example, in forensics and cybercrime, to complement uniformed officers.",
            "However, there are natural limits to how much further we can grow the force without compromising standards. Indeed, the COI has recognised this and made the observation that quality rather than just quantity should be the major consideration in augmenting our force of fully-fledged Police Officers. Like other organisations or companies, it is not easy to hire and retain officers of good quality.",
            "Besides our regular Police officers, we also tap on full-time National Service officers, for example, in our Public Transport Security Command, NSmen, volunteers and community partners. In addition, Police deploy Auxiliary Police Officers to carry out duties of a more specific nature that do not require a fully-fledged Police officer who is trained to deal with a multitude of situations.",
            "Besides increasing manpower, Police have also been using improved deployment strategies, such as Community Policing, to build stronger partnerships with the community to fight crime. Police have also invested in technology as a force multiplier. For example, in the past two years, more than 18,000 Police Cameras have been installed at 3,300 HDB void decks and multi-storey car parks. These have been effective in deterring crime. All 10,000 HDB blocks will have Police Cameras by 2016. This combination of better operational deployments and applying technology have contributed significantly to keeping crime low and solving cases. For example, the number of unlicensed moneylending harassment cases has been cut by more than 50% compared to five years ago.",
            "The fourth recommendation is for SPF and SCDF to continue to build on their ability to respond in a concerted and co-ordinated manner to public order situations.",
            "The COI reported that the response to the riot demonstrated strong teamwork and collaboration between the SPF and SCDF units in the first phase of extrication and rescue.",
            "Mdm Speaker, Police, SCDF and other Home Team agencies work closely on the ground daily when responding to incidents, and have jointly developed protocols to handle major incidents. We will continue to integrate and enhance the capabilities of frontline first responders through joint standard operating procedures. These joint SOPs are also validated and improved through regular joint exercises.",
            "The fifth recommendation is for SPF to look into generally cutting layers of approval or time needed to activate essential resources to respond to public order incidents and other emergencies.",
            "The COI found that the approval process for activating the SOC was one factor that slowed their arrival. The Police have since then shortened the approval process. Prior to the 8 December riot, the activation of SOC troops required the concurrence of the Director Operations of Police. There were two key reasons for this procedure. First, the deployment of the SOC is a high-signature move and the assessment should be done by a more senior officer. Second, the Director Operations is better placed to assess the overall national needs and priorities when there are competing demands.",
            "Police have made the process for activating the SOC for a public order incident more direct. Division Commanders can now activate the first SOC troop while alerting Police Headquarters at the same time. Traffic Police will also be simultaneously activated to facilitate the SOC's speedy movement to the incident location.",

            ": Thank you. I now move on to the COI's recommendations to manage foreign worker congregation areas. This is the sixth recommendation of the COI, which is to install additional lighting, safety and surveillance devices in areas which see large congregations of foreign workers, in addition to making better basic facilities available to those who congregate there.",
            "Mdm Speaker, I had mentioned in my statement to Parliament in January this year that several measures had been progressively implemented in Little India since October 2006 to improve the physical environment; that is, prior to the 8 December riot in 2013. These included installation of backlane lighting, additional railings along Serangoon Road and operating the Little India Bus Services for workers.",
            "Since 2009, Police have deployed auxiliary police officers and private security officers in Little India to manage anti-social behaviour. In 2011, these numbers were increased, and, since then, there have been 81 officers deployed on weekends.",
            "Agencies will continue to work together to improve infrastructure and enhance safety in Little India. We are currently installing additional lighting in 44 locations in Little India. LTA has concreted the grass patch at Tekka Lane and similar works are on-going for a 10-metre wide strip of the field abutting Hampshire Road for use as a passenger waiting area for the Little India Bus Services. Permanent shelters and queue heads will be provided by the first quarter of 2015. Any change in the capacity of the Little India Bus Services will be gradual and in line with other whole-of-Government measures for Little India. Agencies will also look at various issues, such as bus service timing, to spread out demand and avoid crowding.",
            "For better traffic management, Lembu Road has, since 8 June 2014, been closed to vehicular traffic every Sunday from noon to midnight. Campbell Lane will be converted into a pedestrian mall by the first quarter of 2015. Two new traffic lights will be installed along Serangoon Road and will be synchronised with existing crossings. These measures will enhance road safety and smoothen pedestrian and vehicular traffic flow.",
            "Prior to the 8 December riot, there were 113 Police Cameras in public areas and HDB blocks in Little India. Since then, we have more than doubled the number to 250 Police Cameras. All 41 HDB blocks in Little India now have Police Cameras. Police will progressively install another 88 cameras in public areas between now and December 2015. This overall trebling of the number of cameras, beyond what was initially planned within this timeframe, will provide greater deterrence to crime and anti-social behaviour and allow Police and enforcement agencies to deploy their officers more effectively and forestall or respond more quickly to incidents.",
            "Police have stepped up presence in Little India since the riot with an additional 20 to 30 Police officers deployed every weekend along with a dedicated SOC troop. This is complemented by the 81 APOs and private security officers currently deployed there on weekends. To sustain an increased presence in the longer term, Police is looking at increasing the number of APOs and private security officers deployed in Little India from the current 81 to 93 officers. Police will continue to monitor the situation and calibrate the manpower and other measures deployed accordingly.",
            "Public agencies have also been working together to address issues in other foreign worker congregation areas, such as Geylang. Let me take Geylang as one example. There will be stricter enforcement of licensing and parking rules, and 252 more cameras installed in Geylang by end 2016, compared to the 47 existing ones. We will also be enhancing the street lighting at 36 back alleys in Geylang.",
            "For these congregation areas, Police will continue to conduct frequent patrols and enforcement checks to maintain law and order. In Geylang, for instance, an SOC troop conducts weekly anti-crime patrols to augment existing police resources patrolling the area. Police will also continue to deploy APOs to project additional uniformed presence at congregation areas.",
            "The Minister for Manpower will speak later on the COI's seventh recommendation to make more services and amenities available to foreign workers outside of congregation areas, and to work with local community stakeholders on measures to reduce congestion at congregation areas.",
            "The COI's eighth and final recommendation is to more strictly enforce against public drunkenness and set in place alcohol restrictions in hotspots where large crowds typically indulge in heavy drinking and, therefore, where a triggering incident could spark a breakdown of public order.",
            "Prior to the riot, MHA had already embarked on a wider review of measures to control the sale and public consumption of alcohol, to address concerns of public order and disamenities.",
            "Between October and December 2013, stakeholders and the general public were consulted on proposals to designate no-alcohol zones at some public places; and shorten the sale hours of liquor at retail outlets. Six hundred and twenty four persons participated in the e-Poll, and 337 pieces of written feedback were received. We also conducted focus-group discussions with members of the public and representatives from retail and public entertainment outlets. The majority supported such proposals.",
            "The second phase of consultation was launched via the REACH portal on 16 June 2014 to seek the public's views on possible models for limiting the sale and public consumption of alcohol, drawing on examples from other countries and cities. This will help us to develop a model that best suits Singapore's needs and which will be effective and sustainable. This second phase of consultation will end on 31 July 2014.",
            "Since the implementation of the Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Act on 1 April 2014, 163 individuals were found consuming alcohol in public during prohibited hours. They have been issued with Police advisories. Two liquor establishments are under investigation for contravening licensing conditions. Police has been consulting closely with the Little India Shopkeepers and Heritage Association, residents and Advisers to implement the measures as smoothly as possible. Feedback on the alcohol restrictions from residents has been generally positive.",
            "In formulating the new measures on the sale and public consumption of alcohol, we will take into consideration public and industry feedback, the COI's recommendations and our experience from the alcohol restrictions in Little India. We will introduce the necessary legislation within the next six months before the Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Act expires in March 2015.",
            "Mdm Speaker, let me thank the COI once again for its thorough and comprehensive work in the past six months. The COI adopted an open and transparent process. It sought submissions from the public, all of which were taken into account in the COI's deliberations. The public hearing was conducted in open court, with no restrictions on media or public attendance.",
            "The COI came to the conclusion that the overall outcome of the SPF response was good. There was no loss of life, no prolonged fighting between Police and the rioters, and the riot was dispersed relatively quickly. While the COI found that the Home Team had generally performed well in quelling the riot, it has also identified areas for improvement and put forth recommendations which the Government accepts. We will implement all the recommendations. Since the riot, we have already started to strengthen our capabilities and enhance our operational effectiveness.",
            "Mdm Speaker, the riot was the most serious public order incident Singapore had seen in over 40 years. Home Team officers were called to action; they quelled the riot and restored calm in Little India that night. But there were wider efforts beyond Little India and in the days that followed which helped to maintain calm and stability in Singapore. Members of this House, including Minister Lui Tuck Yew, Ms Denise Phua and Minister Iswaran walked the ground together with grassroots leaders in Little India to reassure the residents and local community. Other Members of this House did the same to reassure residents in their own areas, while other Members, including Minister Shanmugam, Minister Iswaran, Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Dhinakaran, together with staff from the High Commissions of India and Bangladesh, visited dormitories to engage the larger community of foreign workers who were not involved in the riot.",
            "Non-governmental organisations and employers stepped up efforts to assist workers. Operators of recreation centres and dormitories organised more programmes and provided more services for foreign workers. Singaporeans generally responded in a rational and calm manner. All these efforts helped to ensure that there were no spill-over tensions after the riot and helped us restore normalcy quickly. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this community effort.",
            "Mdm Speaker, Minister for Manpower Tan Chuan-Jin will now address the foreign manpower issues in relation to the COI's recommendations and observations, after which, Mdm Speaker, with your permission, we will both address any matters that Members may wish to raise. Thank you."

            ": Mdm Speaker, Deputy Prime Minister Teo provide MHA's response to the findings and recommendations of the COI into the Little India Riot on 8 December 2014. I will now respond to the part that touches on the management of the foreign workforce in Singapore.",
            "I am glad that the COI has established that the underlying cause of the 8 December riot was not systemic dissatisfaction with employment and living conditions in Singapore among foreign workers. I think we can all agree that the process of inquiry was robust and the evidence and testimonials furnished to the COI by non-government organisations, civil society activists and, more importantly, the foreign workers themselves, helped us see things in a proper perspective.",
            "The COI has also concluded that by and large, we have a good framework in place to protect foreign workers. This includes regular reviews to ensure that legislation is adequate and appropriate. Most Members would be aware that over the last few years, we have enacted a series of legislative changes to the Employment Act, the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act and the Employment Agencies Act to better protect workers.",
            "The COI's findings have also been corroborated by the interim results of another survey conducted after the riot by an independent survey company Nexus Link, and commissioned by MOM and the Migrant Workers Centre (MWC). Again, the results are consistent with the COI findings and showed that the vast majority of foreign workers, over 90%, expressed high levels of satisfaction with working in Singapore and planned to continue working here after their current employment stint. Over 80% said that they would recommend Singapore to their friends and relatives as a place for work. Satisfactory pay and working and living conditions were the top three reasons cited for recommending Singapore as a place to work.",
            "In addition to these survey findings, the fact is that over 70% of foreign workers renew their contracts after the first two years. Taken together, these pieces of evidence suggest that the majority of foreigners continue to consider Singapore an attractive place to work. Ultimately, what the workers themselves say and do matter. The COI report puts to rest the more speculative causes for the riot that were offered by some critics and that were echoed blindly by some sections of the foreign media. These same critics often propagated this, painting a negative picture of our agencies, of Singaporeans and of Singapore at large to not just our internal local audience but to the international audience as well.",
            "Significantly, the Indian media, which had a more direct interest in this issue and more access to the workers, on the whole reported responsibly and fairly on the Little India riot. As the Foreign Minister has noted, this incident has not affected our bilateral relations with India.",
            "While the COI has found no evidence of systemic mistreatment of foreign workers, they have pointed out that there might nonetheless be a minority of errant employers who mistreat their workers. I have stated this before in this House: mistreatment does exist. In an earlier statement in Parliament, I have also cited the number of egregious cases. While any case should not be tolerated, the numbers are exceedingly small. My Ministry treats feedback on mistreatment of workers, whether local or foreign, very seriously and we will investigate such employers. If there is clear evidence that any employer or any other person has breached the law, we will not hesitate to take the necessary enforcement actions. I might add that workers who provide false information – and that occurs as well – must also be held accountable.",
            "I accept fully the COI's observation that there is always room to improve the situation. Indeed, that is so. We certainly do not take the current state of affairs for granted and will be implementing the thoughtful recommendations in the COI report.",
            "The COI has recommended that more services and amenities be made available to foreign workers outside of congregation areas like in Little India. This is something that we are already doing, and intend to step up on. Indeed, providing for the needs of foreign workers requires strong inter-agency coordination overseen by an inter-Ministerial committee, covering issues like housing, transport and security. Efforts are on-going to speed up the construction of dormitories which, beyond providing adequate living space, have built-in amenities and recreational facilities to take care of the daily basic living needs of workers. The new dormitories which are being launched are required to be self-contained, with adequate space set aside for living and gathering, as well as the provision of facilities like mini-marts, gyms, canteens and TV rooms and, of course, WiFi, which is very important. Over time, we aim for more workers to be accommodated in such self-contained housing facilities which will reduce the need to travel far for basic services.",
            "We also recognise that this is not simply an issue of providing hard infrastructure. Soft infrastructure matters and operators of dormitories have a role to play. As I have previously mentioned, MOM will be establishing a regulatory framework for large dormitories that have a larger impact on their surrounding communities. I am pleased to note that from our engagements with industry, the operators are on board with us on this. My Ministry is working through the details and will provide more information of this regulatory framework in the coming months.",
            "The Government is also pressing on with efforts to establish more dedicated recreation centres for foreign workers. There are four today – in Soon Lee, Kaki Bukit, Woodlands and Penjuru. We will increase their number in tandem with the increase in our foreign workforce numbers. These centres provide a wider range of amenities that individual dormitories may not be able to, such as remittance and banking services, supermarkets and sports facilities. We will work closely with local community stakeholders in shaping the amenities and services available at these centres so that workers do not need to go far to get access to these services.",
            "The COI has also suggested that more effort be made to educate foreign workers on issues, such as their rights and protections, avenues for them to seek assistance and local social norms. Currently, we already make an effort to push out essential information to workers before they enter Singapore and throughout their stay here. Information on key salary components is included in the In-Principle Approval letter which employers must send to their in-coming workers in their home countries, in their own languages, before they depart for Singapore.",
            "As part of the Work Permit card issuance process, a comprehensive guidebook is given which covers workers' legal rights and responsibilities, channels for assistance provided by Government and non-government organisations, as well as social norms. Workers who have problems can always approach MOM for help at our Services Centre. Workers who approach us for assistance can be assured that due effort will be taken to safeguard their interests and well-being.",
            "During their stay, road-shows are conducted by Government agencies at dormitories and key foreign worker gathering spots. Newsletters are also regularly distributed to keep workers updated on our latest initiatives or policy changes. Much of our engagement of foreign workers is conducted in the workers' native languages.",
            "Nonetheless, we do accept the suggestion by the COI and will look into how our outreach to workers can be further improved. For example, we are looking to create more targeted and easier to understand materials so that key messages can be put across to foreign workers more simply. We will also look to extend our reach through collaboration with partners like student volunteers, many of whom have expressed an interest in befriending foreign worker groups.",
            "Even as we undertake to effectively manage the foreign workers in our midst, the broader lesson is that foreign worker numbers cannot grow in an unabated manner. In line with the recommendations made by the Economic Strategies Committee in 2010, we have begun to moderate the growth of foreign workers to more sustainable levels, with a greater emphasis on productivity improvements. We have also taken deliberate and progressive steps to raise the quality profile of our foreign workforce and help businesses reduce their reliance on low-cost foreign labour. This is painful but it is a necessary adjustment we are making to restructure our economy, and the Government has introduced the $5.9 billion Quality Growth Programme in Budget 2013 to help our businesses and industries to make this transition.",
            "The foreign workforce tightening measures have slowed foreigner growth significantly. Excluding construction and domestic workers, the foreign worker growth rate was halved from 9.4% in 2011 to 4.6% in 2012, and halved again to just 2.3% in 2013. For construction, manpower has grown over the past few years in large part to support the ramp-up of construction projects, including essential transportation, housing and healthcare infrastructure for Singaporeans. We will continue to build in the coming years, but in a more manpower-lean manner, with many construction productivity measures being introduced.",
            "In conclusion, the COI has rightly pointed out that the riot was a unique event, perpetuated by individuals who were not representative of the majority of responsible and law-abiding foreign workers. The COI's findings have made clear that negative generalisations about the foreign workforce have no place in our society.",
            "I believe that Singaporeans genuinely appreciate the contributions of these workers and wish to co-exist harmoniously with them. On our part, the Government will continue to nurture, to manage such spaces; as well as to manage the overall numbers to minimise impact on the local community."

            "The Member asked a very interesting question. I have responded to the COI's recommendations in the sequence and the order in which the COI made its recommendations, as it is easier to understand the actions taken from that point of view. But it may not be as intuitive if you are looking at it from what the Police and other agencies actually do on a daily basis and how they would minimise the likelihood of a riot and how do they deal with it. So, I will now discuss what we are doing in that sequence rather than the sequence of the recommendations.",

            "First, we now have more Police Cameras in critical locations, not just in Little India but in other areas. In critical areas, these cameras will enable Police to make better and faster appreciation of a developing situation. In fact, it will allow the Division and Combined Operations Room (COR) to take actions even to forestall a situation from becoming something more serious and to make deployment decisions earlier.",
            "For example, if you see a crowd build up or if you see a group of people starting to get a bit rowdy, you can actually respond to that more quickly and diffuse the situation before it becomes something more serious. And then with a better appreciation of the total situation that is provided by the cameras at one central location, it is easier for the Police to deploy the various forces that they have and to coordinate their activities better. So this is what it means in operational terms on, say, a typical crowded weekend. And having seen what has happened, they can also make a call if they need other resources more quickly, such as the SOC.",
            "The second point is that Police has shortened the approval process to activate the SOC. The combination of these two means that the need for additional resources, such as the SOC, can be appreciated earlier and the call can be made earlier, cutting down the time to respond, which is one of the key issues that the COI quite rightly pointed out.",
            "Third, the new Combined Operations Room and the new C3 system will be operational by the end of this year. They will strengthen Police's incident management and enable Police to marshal and deploy forces better to deal with rapidly developing situations and provide a better and quicker response. So, not just in one locality, but even if they have a number of different incidents to manage around the island.",
            "Fourth, commanders and officers on the ground will be able to communicate better with the new communications and C3 system. I have been involved in many operations myself and the communication system is never enough to meet operational needs. We need to improve the communications and C3 system, so that the ground officers will be able to communicate better with each other. They will be better able to coordinate and adjust their responses as they will have a better picture of what is happening, where the on-scene forces are as well as those that are arriving to assist them.",
            "The Police have also revised its doctrines and protocols on communications for a major incident. Additional networks will be made available to provide communications during a major incident. This will help manage and reduce congestion of the communication networks.",
            "Fifth, as I have mentioned, we will be doubling the size and capability of the SOC progressively over the next two to three years. This will provide us with a more capable, flexible and faster response capability.",
            "Sixth, the lessons learnt from this incident, which the COI has analysed, will enter into the review of training and doctrines and in equipping of our frontline officers. The scenarios and possible responses painted by the COI will also enter into doctrine development, and the training of our officers and commanders.",
            "I have gone into some detail in my statement and also in this response because we take the lessons from this incident seriously and we take the recommendations of the COI very seriously. And MHA and the Police will implement the recommendations vigorously.",
            "In my statement, I have also stated what complementary measures we are taking in congregation areas in general and also specific to Little India. With these efforts, we will be able to minimise the likelihood of a riot taking place while at the same time, improving our capabilities to contain and quell a riot quickly if one does occur.",
            "But Madam, I have visited a number of cities, both in western countries and in eastern countries, to look at their public order and counter-terrorism forces, C3 systems and contingency planning and deployment. Even in cities with the most intensive 24-hour sensor and C3 coverage of critical areas and officers present on the ground to respond all the time, they have not been able to guarantee that there are no incidents.",
            "Just as Singaporeans did not expect the riot to break out on 8 December arising from a fatal road accident, a public order incident can be sparked off by a single trigger or a confluence of factors. It is not possible to predict or foresee to the last detail every possible incident that can arise. But we can and we will need to work on minimising the chances of a riot taking place while at the same time improving our capabilities to quell a riot if it does.",
            "I have spoken at length on the manpower issues and how we are dealing with them. These are not unique to the Police or the Home Team. Every organisation in the public sector and the private sector is dealing with these issues: productivity, recruitment, retention; how we can use our people better; where we can save manpower and re-deploy it to other areas. In the Police Force, we will do that as well. I have outlined some of those measures earlier. But we are quite confident that we will be able to strengthen the SOC with the additional 300 troops in the next two to three years' time."

What actions will they take in relation to the ground commander, if any?",
            "The second is probably the flip side of the question. The Committee was also quite complimentary of the overall result that was achieved and also singled out certain Police officers for praise. Will anything be done to recognise the efforts of these Police officers?"

The COI had put forward a more interventionist course of action that the officers might have taken that night during that half-hour period.",
            "The purpose of an inquiry after an event has occurred is to determine what happened and how things could be done better. The COI has indeed carried out a thorough analysis and put forward its views on what could have been done in such a situation with full knowledge of all the information and the facts. The assessment put forward by the COI, as I had said earlier, would be very useful to be entered into the doctrine development process, training, scenario injects or scenario-based training for officers and commanders. They would be able to consider issues, such as how would you best bring a situation under control and, if you intervened and if you took certain actions, would it cause the situation to escalate or to de-escalate? Or what relative strength of forces is needed to carry out particular courses of action?",
            "But the COI arrived at the assessment based on a reconstruction of all available information after the riot. When I evaluate the actions of the commanders and officers on that night, I have to look at the context of the situation that they faced that night and the information that they had available.",
            "Riots are dynamic situations which call for dynamic responses. This is a point which the COI also made. It is thus important for us to consider the dynamic and rapidly unfolding situation that night and the situation faced by the commanders.",
            "On the night of the riot, the officers arrived at the scene as quickly as they could. As they arrived, the commanders and officers came into the midst of a highly charged and rapidly evolving situation. In fact, some Home Team officers were injured by the actions of the crowd very early on, even during Phase 1. The officers and commanders had to make decisions in the heat of the action, under time pressure, based on the information they had available before them at that time. The Police Division Commander, as I had mentioned, arrived at 10.11 pm. Shortly after that, a few minutes after, the riot flared up and, by 10.28 pm, the first cars were flipped over and set on fire.",
            "The commanders and officers did not have the benefit of hindsight and all the information available. We know what happened that night and what decisions had been taken by the officers on the ground. But we will not be able to definitively know what might have happened if a different course of action had been taken. We cannot be sure that it will definitely be better. We do not know if it might be better or the outcome might have been worse. Because we know that the crowd was emotional and prone to misperceptions.",
            "Mdm Speaker, as I said, it is not always possible to take the analyses done after the fact and substitute them for the judgement that the commander or the officers had to make on the ground at that moment in time.",
            "The actions of the Police also have to be seen to be proportionate and fair. In fact, I would say that the day after the riot, because the actions of the Police were seen as proportionate and fair, it helped also to restore calm and confidence among all parties – Singaporeans, foreign workers and the whole community. If the Police's actions were seen to be excessive, I think it would have caused a new set of issues and concerns.",
            "I would also like to make an additional point. This is the issue of how much forces you need when you are assessing whether to take action. When you are able to have the force advantage, you can choose the amount of force to use and calibrate it better. You decide whether to escalate. When you have to intervene and you do not have a force advantage to engage a mob, matters can quickly escalate to the use of lethal force. In that situation where you do not have the force advantage, it is actually the mob that decides whether there is an uncontrolled escalation and not the officers.",
            "There will be situations where engaging is necessary, even without the force advantage, for example, when lives are at imminent risk. But I think that it is not so easy to substitute an analysis after the fact for the judgement that officers have to make on the ground.",

I think it is not a new issue and we have discussed this in Parliament for quite a number of years. As Deputy Prime Minister mentioned, the first time it was taken seriously in that sense was in 2008. That was when the House had to face the fact that there were several security lapses, for example, the escape of Mas Selamat, ICA clearing people with the wrong passport and people escaping from Court. And now we find that we are confronting this issue again because of another major incident, meaning a riot.",
            "I would like to ask Deputy Prime Minister Teo whether he himself was personally surprised at the Commissioner's statement that in his assessment 1,000 more officers were needed by the Police to be effective. Is this indicative of any communication gap between the heads of departments and the Ministers, for example?",
            "In one of my recent Parliamentary Questions (PQs) in 2012, I had asked the Government about policing resources, in particular, about community policing. And the Government did not seem to quite agree that there was a serious under resource problem. And yet during the COI, we find the Commissioner talking about robbing Peter to pay Paul to find resources, the SOC saying that they could not arrest people because they did not have enough manpower.",
            "So, I would like to ask the Minister whether he was surprised at this assessment by the Commissioner of Police and whether this indicates a communication gap. And also, whether there is some other more holistic way that the Government assesses resource deficiencies rather than to act because of incidents that occurred of such a nature?",
            "The second clarification concerns one of the findings of the COI about the causes of the riot. The COI mentioned that one of the main contributory factors was a misperception by the crowd that they were being discriminated against by the responders and so on. There were some quotes by workers asking if their lives were worthless and so on. I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he agrees that it is important for us to look at the way we do our law enforcement on our foreign workers. In other words, are we harsh towards them or do we give them a certain level of respect?",

In 2008, for example, when there was an incident of an attack of a woman at Clementi Woods, what the Police did was to round up the nearby construction workers, 200 of them, to take blood samples from them. Looking at the methods used, I mean, there may be an impression created that there is a certain stereotyping, for example, by the Police in their actions. Commissioner of Police also mentioned that in Geylang, there was hostility and antagonism towards the Police. Would the Police be looking at their policing methods?",
            "The third question is about training of the frontline officers. The COI recommended that the frontline officers should also be trained and equipped to deal with some public order disturbances. I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he agrees that no amount of training really can be a substitute for actual practice in policing such incidents. In this light, would he consider, for example, that the Police should allow more peaceful protests in Singapore in certain designated roads, so that the Police can actually, on a regular basis, test their policing capabilities in terms of policing cause-based crowds. Riots, of course we do not want that, but they progress, basically, from some sort of cause-based protest. I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he would consider that.",
            "The fourth clarification is whether the Police will be looking at drawing up specific incident management plans for hotspots, such as Little India. It was not clear from the COI findings whether there was any incident management plan drawn up prior to the incident. So, is this something that the Police are looking at?",
            "Fifth, if you look at the map, there is a boundary between two Police Divisions in Little India. I think that Race Course Road is a boundary. On the west side, it is policed by Tanglin and the eastern side, it is policed by Central. Will the Police be looking at whether this can be a complication as in, if something were to happen, who is to take charge, for example? Did this boundary, for example, cause DAC Lu, in the sequence of events, to try to marshal resources from \"E\" Division, when \"A\" Division resources were actually quite nearby? Would the Police be looking at whether a more seamless management of such hot spots under one division would be a better way?",
            "Last of all, the riot control doctrine was discussed during the COI and we were told that the incident manager was supposed to assess the crowd intent, sentiments and so on. I would like to ask whether there was actually in the plan the requirement to provide a psychologist or other assistance to the incident manager to help him make this kind of difficult assessment."

Riot control doctrine and whether or not a psychologist is useful: part of the training of the riot troopers and the commanders, in particular, is to understand crowd psychology. But whether we will have a psychologist actually next to the riot control commander to advise him continually, I am not sure that that is necessary or practical. But they have to understand crowd psychology in terms of how to deal with a crowd.",
            "I had a long talk with the SOC officers when I visited them prior to the riot and again after the riot, and they explained to me some of the approaches that they used in riot dispersal, and a lot of that involves crowd psychology.",
            "On the boundaries, I think the suggestion, the observation that Ms Lim makes is a valid one. Police are looking at this issue of where to draw the boundaries. Of course, wherever you draw the boundaries, you can have a problem. Because as Ms Lim pointed out, perhaps the Commander of \"E\" called the \"E\" Division resources, and did not call the \"A\" Division resources. But supposing it had been drawn all within one division, then you could have said \"Well, the boundary is so close by, how come you did not divide it into two, so that the resources of both divisions could be called?\" So, there is always a boundary issue whenever you have such issues.",
            "But on the incident response that night, I have looked carefully at the COI report and I have also looked carefully at the Police's AAR Report, the boundary issue did not seem to figure very prominently. Both division commanders actually came on the scene, they were able to coordinate and decide who is in charge. They called in forces from both divisions. But having said that, I think it is a valid consideration whether the boundary can be drawn at another place, but wherever you draw the boundary, you will have boundary problems.",
            "Contingency planning for that night, yes, indeed, there were contingency plans. For example, the Police activated a contingency plan that allowed them to call the fast response cars from around the island to respond quickly to the location. That is one of the contingency plans that the Police have, which they actually activated that night.",
            "On whether we want to deliberately allow protests and demonstrations in order to give the Police and the SOC practice, perhaps Ms Lim might want to go one step further and, say, allow the protests to get out of hand, so that they get a little bit more practice."

A typical football match and other events like that already provide the SOC quite a lot of activity and action. Quite frankly, I do not think many Singaporeans would want to see more chaos, demonstrations on the streets disrupting their daily lives and also taking up resources which can be used for other purposes.",
            "On the second point on misperceptions. Yes, indeed, there were different views expressed during the COI on how one could interact with people with different cultural backgrounds. Indeed, that I think is an important and valid consideration.

Basically, the manpower issue is not one which is faced only by the Police or by MHA or by the Government. Anyone who runs an organisation in Singapore knows that we face a manpower situation which we all have to deal with. No problem is going to be solved just by asking for more manpower. Whether you work in an MNC, a company or in the Government, you know you are not going to solve your manpower requirements just by asking. But we also know that there is no harm in asking, so we all ask anyway. But that is not the solution and we all know that.",

In the coming five years, we will have fewer young Singaporeans entering the workforce than in the past five years.

It is heartening to hear that there will be efforts taken to improve the lives of foreign workers here and also to help them to understand life in Singapore a bit better.

But it is not common for forces to send their nationals to enforce the law in other countries. So, we do have exchanges regularly, but actual enforcement is another matter.",
            "On the balance between terrorism and public order, this, indeed, is one of the issues which we have to face in building up any force. Do you build up a force which is dedicated only for a particular task? Because then your force is designed and trained only for that and you do not use it for anything else. And if you have another requirement, you build up another force for that. That may not be the most effective way of doing so because you may not have to deal with both simultaneously. They both may have to be on standby. You may want to actually deploy a larger force to deal with one contingency should it occur. Therefore, we do carefully judge what kinds of missions we can give the forces that we have and we train them to be multi-purpose; but we also try not to over-task them because then they will be jacks of all trades but masters of none."

We also have to actually ensure that the employers proactively and actively play their role to ensure that they manage the foreign workers well in their workplaces."

            "Of the 770,000 non-domestic work permit holders, almost half of them are Malaysians who commute to work daily and, therefore do not need dormitory beds, or those in the manufacturing and services sector who are allowed to rent and live in HDB flats and in private estates near the places of their work. The more relevant group pertaining to dormitories is the remaining half, who are the non-Malaysian construction, marine and process workers – about 90% of whom are already housed in purpose-built dormitories, factory-converted dormitories and quarters on construction sites. A vast majority of these housing premises are within regulatory norms. These dormitories are not of uniform standards. I think that is something that we acknowledge but, as mentioned, over the next few years, the aim is to speed up the construction of more purpose-built dormitories to ensure that the daily basic living needs of foreign workers are better taken care of. Over time, the aim is for a vast majority of this group of workers to be accommodated in such self-contained housing facilities. These efforts have already started a number of years ago, and will continue unabated."

Overall, SCDF responded to the riot relatively swiftly. The responding officers, led by ASP Tang and Lieutenant Neo, did a commendable job and, lastly, there was also effective command. My point is that while we debate what more could have been done, what improvements can be made, I believe it is important that this House also puts on record the bravery of the officers who conducted themselves courageously on that night. To this end, I would like to clarify whether it is the intention of MHA, in its post-mortem of the COI report, to commend the officers who carried out their duties professionally and bravely."

In my question directed at MHA during the Committee of Supply debate this year, I asked about the cultural training given to law enforcers. The Second Minister replied to say that a structured training programme is in place to ensure that APOs are able to meet operational needs. In light of the COI report which states that APOs and SPF officers should be given some basic training in cultural sensitivity, to this end, is the Ministry looking into amending the training programme for officers who patrol areas frequented by foreign workers? And if so, what is the scope of the cultural sensitivity training that the public can expect?",
            "Second question – until new laws on the regulation of public consumption of alcohol in general are passed, is there a plan to introduce the restrictions on alcohol consumption in Little India to other places frequented by foreign workers, such as Geylang and the Golden Mile Beach Road areas, since the cause of the Little India riot may potentially be replicated in other areas where large congregations of foreign workers gather?",
            "Third question – how does the Ministry plan to encourage greater awareness of section 18 of the Miscellaneous Offences Act, as recommended by the COI?",
            "To the Minister for Manpower, the COI report states that it supports better initiatives to improve accommodation facilities available to foreign workers here, as small improvements can significantly better workers' lives. To this end, how many dormitories currently comply with the URA's 2012 revised amenity provision guidelines covering all dormitories that house between 50 and 5,000 workers which require a minimum living space of 4.5 sqm per worker? When does MOM expect all dormitories to comply with the requirements set out in these guidelines? Will similar guidelines covering minimum living space be extended to employers who house their workers in other accommodation? And here I am referring particularly to marine, process and construction workers. Would MOM consider more regular monitoring of foreign worker accommodation for those workers who do not reside in large dormitories, who may be less likely to be aware of their rights in general, notwithstanding the efforts of NGOs and MOM so far?"

And I recall that when we were debating the Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Bill, Members were of the view that we should take measures after having taken into account overall considerations and feedback from other stakeholders all over Singapore, unless the Member is suggesting that we should go ahead and introduce additional temporary measures in other areas right now.",

I mentioned that just now, and this will have to be tuned for each different group and will include things like cultural attitudes, perhaps some language training and so forth.

For example, apart from MOM, there are also SLA, SCDF, CNB, the Police as well as our NSE CCC. Let me just illustrate some of the measures that have been put in place and the efforts that are being undertaken. We educate foreign workers through roadshows. The last was held, for example, in February 2014, and two more of them in July 2014. We also conduct house-to-house visits and advise residents to secure their WiFi network. Since this effort commenced, the number of unsecured WiFi networks has dipped. Obviously, we are in that estate for those who are going to the nearby Housing Board estate in order to tap on these unsecured WiFi",

We are studying a proposal to convert vacant state lands beside the dormitories into recreational sport areas for foreign workers; the need for more CCTVs in the area; more frequent visits by uniformed officers and engagement with foreign workers on crime-related issues; frequent engagement with dormitory management on security-related matters. We are also stepping up on enforcement efforts against anti-social behaviour, such as littering and urinating in public.",
            "So, it is a combined effort to keep the situation in check. But from a broader perspective, I think the solution really is to enhance these facilities in dormitories around the country so that the workers themselves have access to these dormitories. In fact, from our survey, we have found that many workers do actually stay on in the dormitories, in large part because one of their objectives in coming to Singapore is to work hard and remit monies back home. And one way is to save money. Some of them, from time to time, will go out, but when there is good access to some of these facilities within the dormitories, many of them do stay within their dormitories. So, that is the approach that we are taking, going forward. But, meanwhile, in areas where there are disamenities that are happening, we work closely with the local communities and other agencies to minimise disruption and inconveniences to residents."

The COI report described what happened that night but, as several Members have pointed out, it is also important to recall what did not happen that night. The COI pointed out that while the riot was a shock to many Singaporeans, there was no loss of life, no prolonged fighting between Police and the rioters and it was dispersed relatively quickly. The riot remained contained in a small area. Arson of private property and looting did not occur. No shots were fired by the Police and neither tear gas nor water cannon was used on the rioters.",
            "Mdm Speaker, the situation would have been totally different if we had woken up the next morning and the \"Nos\" in my previous sentence had been \"Yeses\". Singaporeans and our foreign workforce could have been deeply traumatised. The news would have echoed around the world. We would be grappling today with whether the use of force could have been avoided.",
            "Mdm Speaker, a riot on the streets of Singapore is unacceptable, even with all the \"Nos\".",
            "I would like to thank the Chairman and the members of the COI once again for its thorough and comprehensive report.",
            "The Government accepts all of the COI's recommendations and will implement them vigorously. The actions that my colleague the Minister of Manpower and I have detailed today to implement the recommendations will enable us to minimise the likelihood of a riot occurring and improve our capability to deal effectively with a riot, if it does.",
            "Mdm Speaker, one recurring theme in our deliberations today and also in the COI's proceedings and report, is the dedication and the quality of our officers. Beyond quantity, it is, ultimately, quality that counts. It is the quality of the officers and their dedication and commitment that make the key difference. That night, the commanders and officers responded to the call and rushed to the scene, arriving as quickly as they could. They showed dedication to duty and courage as they faced a large, emotionally-charged crowd with a volatile temperament – a crowd whose mood and actions could have suddenly changed with any new trigger, misinformation or misunderstanding.",
            "Our officers and commanders were steadfast in carrying out their mission. They responded when called upon, worked together with their fellow officers, and put themselves in harm's way to manage, contain and eventually quell the riot – a difficult task in the circumstances they faced.",
            "On behalf of the officers in the Home Team, I would like to express my thanks to the Members who have offered encouragement and expressed their appreciation to our Home Team officers and to their commanders.",
            "Several Members have suggested that we recognise the officers for their dedication to duty that night. The Government will consider recognising the Home Team officers who answered the call to action to quell the riot that night in the face of personal danger and under difficult circumstances. We will also see how we can recognise particular officers who stood out for their outstanding response during the riot.",
            "Mdm Speaker, the work of our Home Team officers is difficult and challenging. They work round-the-clock and often put themselves in harm's way to keep Singapore and all of us and our families safe and secure. The encouragement and support from Members of this House and from Singaporeans make a real and positive difference, not just to those who were called to action that night but to all Home Team officers. It means a lot to them that their efforts are appreciated and recognised. I am confident that, with your support, they will continue to do their utmost to keep us safe and secure.",
            "The Home Team and other Government agencies, we have all learnt valuable lessons from this incident. By implementing the COI's recommendations, we will be better prepared – the Home Team, the Government as well as Singapore will emerge readier and stronger from this incident.

            "The Radiation Protection Act was first enacted in 1973 to control the import, export, sale, transport, possession and use of radioactive material and irradiating apparatus. The Act was repealed and re-enacted in 1991 to include, amongst other amendments, the control of non-ionising radiation.",
            "In 2007, the Act was again repealed and re-enacted to transfer the roles and functions of the Centre for Radiation Protection (CRP), as the administrator of the Act, from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to the National Environment Agency (NEA). The 2007 Act was also enacted to prepare for Singapore's ratification of the Additional Protocol to the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement under the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).",
            "The Act has served us well over the years and is crucial to ensure that radioactive material and irradiating apparatus are stringently regulated and managed. Singaporeans today go about our daily lives without having to worry about the risk of being exposed to unnecessary radiation from the use of radioactive material and irradiating apparatus. This would not have been possible without the Act.",
            "However, we must not take the safe and clean environment we enjoy in Singapore today for granted. Many countries are currently using nuclear energy, or are actively exploring nuclear as a source of energy. Nonetheless, given the particular challenges that it poses, the decision to use nuclear energy should never be taken lightly and all countries have to put much thought and effort into their planning. As any such nuclear incident could have far-reaching transboundary effects, it is important for Singapore to work closely with the regional and the international community to protect our population and environment from radiological exposure.",
            "At the same time, with the increased use of nuclear energy, it also means that the transport of nuclear material across boundaries is occurring more frequently. Hence, it is pertinent that greater attention be given to protecting our population from exposure. As such, there is a need to ensure that the nuclear material is adequately protected during transport. The consequences of nuclear material falling into the wrong hands are potentially disastrous and it is important that there is a global concerted and integrated effort to protect all nuclear material.",
            "Singapore has committed to acceding to the IAEA's Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) and its 2005 Amendment. At the third Nuclear Security Summit held in The Hague in March this year, Prime Minister Lee announced that Singapore would shortly accede to the Convention as part of our commitment to upholding nuclear security as a responsible member of the international community.",
            "We have, therefore, tabled a Bill to amend our Radiation Protection Act to allow Singapore to fulfil the obligations under the CPPNM and its 2005 Amendment, as well as to enhance domestic regulations to protect Singapore from the risk of exposure. This will send a signal that Singapore places a strong emphasis on nuclear safety and security and is willing to fulfil its role as a responsible global citizen.",
            "Mdm Speaker, I shall now highlight the main amendments and new provisions proposed in this Bill.",
            "Under the CPPNM, Parties are obliged to establish various offences relating to nuclear material to ensure adequate protection of nuclear material in international transport, as well as to share information and coordinate recovery and response operations in the event of a threat posed to a consignment of nuclear material. The 2005 Amendment further strengthens the provisions of the Convention to include the protection of nuclear facilities and material in peaceful domestic use, storage as well as transport. While the Convention is already in force, the 2005 Amendment has yet to enter into force. It will enter into force after it has been ratified by two-thirds of the State Parties to the Convention.",
            "The CPPNM and its 2005 Amendment also require Parties to criminalise specific acts relating to nuclear material and nuclear facilities. Therefore, we have proposed amendments to the Radiation Protection Act to criminalise these acts. We have also proposed a second set of amendments to criminalise additional acts as required by the 2005 Amendment. This second set of amendments will be brought into force when the 2005 Amendment enters into force.",
            "These amendments to the Act will provide Singapore with comprehensive protection against criminal acts involving nuclear material. Let me outline some details:",
            "Clauses 5 and 6 of the Amendment Bill seek to further strengthen the control of various dealings with radioactive material and irradiating apparatuses under sections 5 and 6 of the Act, such as the import, export or sale of them, by increasing the maximum imprisonment terms from two to five years for those who do such acts without a licence or licensees who act contrary to the terms of the licence.",
            "Clause 9(1) provides for the criminalisation of various acts done in relation to nuclear material. The new section 26B criminalises various acts done in relation to nuclear material which cause or are likely to cause death, serious injury or substantial property damage. Given the dangerous nature of nuclear material, the new section 26C enhances the imprisonment terms for various property offences. The new section 26D makes it an offence to threaten to use nuclear material to cause death, serious injury or substantial property damage, or to threaten to commit theft or robbery of nuclear material, in order to compel a person, organisation or government to do or abstain from doing an act. The new section 26E requires a person with information that can help prevent a nuclear offence or in arresting or prosecuting the perpetrator of such an offence to disclose it to the Police. The new section 26F confers extra-territorial jurisdiction for various nuclear offences. This helps to ensure that perpetrators do not escape punishment, regardless of who they are or where the offence was committed, which is a key objective of the CPPNM.",
            "Clause 9(2) provides for the amendments needed to implement the 2005 Amendment to the Convention. The new section 26DA criminalises various acts done in relation to nuclear material and which substantially harms the environment. The new section 26DB criminalises various acts done against nuclear facilities. The new section 26DC criminalises the making of threats to commit any of these acts. The new section 26DD gives Singapore jurisdiction to deal with the unlawful export or import of nuclear material occurring in another country.",
            "We are most concerned about acts of sabotage directed against nuclear facilities with the intention to cause death or harm. The most egregious acts must be deterred with the most severe of penalties. Therefore, clause 9(2) proposes that the mandatory death penalty be levied for acts done against a nuclear facility which are committed with the intention to cause death and death is caused. For an act against a nuclear facility which causes death and is committed with the intention to cause serious injury, coupled with the knowledge that the act is likely to cause death, the proposed punishment is the discretionary death penalty. Our view is that these punishments send an appropriately strong signal that the Government regards these as very grave offences. The provisions are tightly scoped and I want to assure the House that they do not extend the death penalty beyond Singapore's existing legislation.",
            "Mdm Speaker, I would like to reiterate the importance of international cooperation.",
            "Further to this, clause 9 inserts provisions to provide for mutual legal assistance and extradition in relation to nuclear offences. To facilitate mutual legal assistance between State Parties to the CPPNM, the new section 26G provides that a foreign nuclear offence is deemed not to be a political offence. This is because the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (Cap 190A) prohibits assistance if the Attorney-General determines that the offence is of a political character. The new section 26H enables extradition between Singapore and a State Party to the Convention or its 2005 Amendment of persons accused of nuclear offences. Both sections 26G and 26H are common provisions found in many of our anti-terrorism laws.",
            "Mdm Speaker, another key obligation of the CPPNM and its 2005 Amendment is for State Parties to share information concerning any unauthorised acts done to nuclear material, any credible threat, or in order to protect threatened nuclear material, amongst others. To allow Singapore to do so, clauses 7 and 8 will amend sections 16 and 17 of the Radiation Protection Act. Amendments to section 16 will enable the Director-General of Environmental Protection to require licence holders to provide him with the requisite information or documents if required to be shared under the CPPNM or its 2005 Amendment. Amendments to section 17 will enable information obtained pursuant to the Act to be disclosed without breach of the duty of secrecy if such disclosure is for the purpose of the CPPNM or its 2005 Amendment.",
            "Mdm Speaker, I will now deal with various other miscellaneous amendments to the Act. Clause 10 inserts a new section 40A to enable enforcement costs to be recovered from a person convicted of certain offences under the Radiation Protection Act.",
            "Clause 12 amends the regulation-making power of the NEA. Regulations may be made for the purposes of implementing the CPPNM and its 2005 Amendment and to enable the screening and decontamination of persons who may be exposed to radiation, for instance, in-bound passengers from places which had nuclear accidents. This is to deal with the legislative gap identified when we were responding to the Fukushima nuclear incident.",

            "We also propose by clause 4 to extend the application of certain provisions of the Radiation Protection Act on the Government. This is on account of the fact that some departments of the Government operate or use radioactive material and irradiating apparatuses when carrying out official duties and functions. The extension of these provisions to cover the Government, especially the licensing regime, will allow NEA to monitor and track the use and location of radioactive material and irradiating equipment, and to monitor the radiation exposure level of public officers and ensure that they are adequately protected.",
            "Mdm Speaker, it is of paramount importance that we do not take our clean and safe environment for granted. Keeping Singapore safe from the risk of radiation requires stringent and continuous efforts and this Amendment Bill is a key part of such an effort. This Amendment Bill will ensure that we have the necessary measures to protect Singapore from radioactive material and irradiating apparatuses in the light of the new challenges that we face. With these, we will be better able to secure a safe environment for our people and for subsequent generations. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move."

            "First of all, many countries, especially those in our region, are currently either using nuclear energy or actively exploring using nuclear energy as a source of power. As such, it is crucial that we have the necessary measures to protect Singapore in case there is an accident, for instance, an accident in a nuclear power plant somewhere near Singapore, or an act of terror involving \"dirty bombs\". It is a valid question that she has posed on whether we are prepared for such incidents and whether our response teams are adequately trained to carry out the necessary protection measures.",

These are administered by NEA to ensure the safe use and handling of all such materials. In addition, the export of specific radioactive and nuclear material, as part of our support for global efforts to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, is controlled under the Strategic Goods (Control) Act and its Regulations and are administered by Singapore Customs.",
            "Operationally, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority deploys radiation monitoring portals at our major cargo entry points to inspect vehicles and containers for the presence of radioactive material, even if they have not been declared to be such. The officers manning the screening equipment are trained in the use of the equipment and standard procedures are in place to deal with instances when such materials are detected, with particular emphasis on protecting the officers concerned and the public in general.",
            "Multi-agency plans are in place to respond to incidents when radioactive materials are released or which may put the public's safety and security at risk. These include the scenarios which Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef has raised.",

          "content": [
            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"",
            "Sir, the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, or CDSA, criminalises the laundering of benefits derived from serious criminal offences and provides for powers to investigate and confiscate such benefits.",
            "The Act was last amended in 2010 to enhance our anti-money laundering measures and adapt them to the changing criminal landscape.",
            "With the increasingly transnational, lucrative and sophisticated nature of criminal activities, the risk of Singapore being used as a conduit to launder criminal proceeds continues to be a concern.",
            "Money laundering undermines the rule of law, erodes the integrity of our financial system and damages our reputation as a trusted international financial centre. Illicit proceeds can also be used to finance terrorism, giving rise to serious national security concerns.",
            "The Police's enforcement efforts and work with various stakeholders have led to an increase in the number of money laundering convictions from 18 in 2010 to 39 in 2013.",
            "To maintain our vigilance and stay ahead of this threat, our criminal laws and anti-money laundering measures must be regularly reviewed to ensure that we have the means to deal with criminal operations swiftly and deprive perpetrators of their illicit gains.",
            "This Bill thus proposes amendments to strengthen our ability to detect, deter and prosecute money laundering offences.",
            "Given the transnational nature of crime and the ease with which large sums can be moved across borders today, it is crucial that strong domestic regulations be complemented with effective international cooperation. Indeed, over the past three years, the number of requests for mutual legal assistance from our foreign counterparts on money laundering and terrorism financing matters has risen from 32 in 2010 to 73 in 2013.",
            "It is, therefore, in our national interest to participate proactively in the global effort against cross-border crime and money laundering. And this affirms our strong stance against such crimes and sends a clear signal that illicit assets do not have safe harbour in Singapore, upholding our status as a well-regarded and well-regulated financial centre.",
            "Therefore, the proposed amendments also seek to facilitate information sharing with foreign law enforcement agencies where transnational criminal elements are involved.",
            "Collectively, these amendments will also better align our laws with the international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, of which Singapore is a member.",
            "Sir, let me now elaborate on the key amendments. First, two amendments that enhance our ability to investigate and prosecute the laundering of criminal benefits derived from foreign predicate offences. Predicate offences are crimes that generate criminal proceeds for laundering.",
            "First, before prosecution can proceed against money laundering involving a foreign predicate offence, the CDSA currently requires that our law enforcement agencies obtain a certificate from a foreign country to establish the foreign predicate offence. However, our agencies have faced difficulties in obtaining such certificates as it is not an internationally established practice.",
            "Many jurisdictions, in fact, do not have this requirement in their laws and thus have no designated authority or powers to issue such certificates. This has adversely affected our prosecution effectiveness.",
            "Clauses 2(a) and (f) serve to allow for a wider range of evidence to be adduced to prove the foreign law which gives rise to the predicate offence.",
            "Such evidence can include foreign court judgments, statements by experts, as well as any statement provided by an appropriate foreign authority confirming that an offence had been committed under its laws.",
            "Second, the CDSA currently has the requirement of dual criminality, that is, it recognises a foreign offence only if the same act also constitutes an offence in Singapore. However, a strict application of dual criminality constrains our ability to prosecute money laundering cases involving the evasion of foreign taxes where there is no local equivalent.",
            "To address this, the amended definition of a \"foreign serious offence\" will include a foreign tax evasion offence, so long as the offence has been criminalised in the foreign jurisdiction and it is committed wilfully with intent to evade tax. These amendments are consistent with Singapore's commitments under tax treaties and will deter tax-illicit monies from flowing into Singapore.",
            "Sir, next I will touch on measures to increase deterrence against money laundering activities.",
            "Clauses 11 to 14 increase the maximum imprisonment term for money laundering offences from seven to 10 years. This is consistent with the maximum penalties for terrorism financing, recognising the similar gravity of both types of criminal activities.",
            "Today, our laws allow us to confiscate the instruments used, or intended to be used, in the commission of a crime, in addition to any benefits derived from such conduct. This ensures that criminals are deprived of all resources used for, and obtained from, their illegal activities.",
            "Such instruments can also easily re-enter circulation to perpetuate illegal activities, thereby further frustrating the intent of our legislation and enforcement efforts. To address this, clause 5 introduces new provisions to allow the Public Prosecutor to apply to the Court – upon securing a conviction for a predicate offence – to make a substitute property confiscation order against the defendant, if he had used or intended to use any instrument for the commission of the offence and it is not available for confiscation.",
            "The offender will be required to pay to the Government the value of the instrument as assessed by the Court.",
            "The current confiscation processes for benefits of crime, and the attendant safeguards, will also be applied to the substitute property confiscation order with modifications as necessary. This proposed power is in line with international requirements under FATF and will keep our confiscation regime robust.",
            "To further enhance our vigilance against potential money laundering activities, two measures will be implemented.",
            "First, the CDSA currently requires travellers, who carry physical currency and bearer negotiable instruments exceeding S$30,000 into or out of Singapore, to declare the amount in their possession at the checkpoints.",
            "Henceforth, we will prescribe the cross-border cash reporting threshold in subsidiary legislation instead, and lower the threshold from S$30,000 to S$20,000. The current threshold of S$30,000 was set in 2007 to meet FATF's recommended reporting threshold of €15,000. The revision to S$20,000 takes into account the appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the Euro in recent years and allows us to keep closer watch over large volume cash movements.",
            "Prescribing the reporting threshold in subsidiary legislation also allows timely changes to be made in response to currency fluctuations. The revised reporting threshold also aligns us better with practices of comparable international jurisdictions, such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand.",
            "Second, clause 19 introduces new provisions for certain prescribed persons to conduct customer due diligence, keep records and file cash transaction reports when they transact with a customer in cash exceeding a certain threshold amount.",
            "Such a regime is already in place for the casinos in Singapore.",
            "In line with FATF standards, we will expand such requirements to the Precious Stones and Metal Dealers, or the PSMD sector, in view of the potential risk it poses as a conduit for money laundering and terrorism financing activities.",
            "PSMDs will be required to verify the customer's identity and file a report with the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO) when they transact a sale with a customer in cash exceeding S$20,000. Such cash transaction records and relevant supporting documents are to be kept for a period of five years from the date of filing.",
            "The definition of PSMDs and customer due diligence requirements will be set out in regulations made under section 64 of the CDSA. Clause 22 amends that section to empower the Minister for Home Affairs to make a contravention of any provision of those regulations an offence.",
            "In developing this regulatory regime, MHA, MOF and MAS have jointly consulted the public and key industry players, such as the Singapore Jewellers Association and the Singapore Clock and Watch Trade Association, and received broad support for the measures. The implementation details of the PSMD and revised cross-border cash reporting measures will be announced in due course.",
            "Sir, I now come to the amendments to enhance international cooperation and to facilitate information sharing.",
            "The Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office, or STRO, was established administratively in the year 2000 within the Commercial Affairs Department. It is the office responsible for the receipt and analysis of suspicious transaction reports and other financial intelligence reports.",
            "Clause 4 formalises STRO's mandate by establishing its functions in the CDSA. To discharge its functions, STRO officers are given powers to obtain relevant information for the purpose of analysing the reports made to it.",
            "Financial intelligence derived can be shared with foreign counterparts for their investigations into foreign offences, subject to appropriate safeguards. Clause 10(c) provides more flexibility for intelligence sharing, given its importance as a channel of cooperation in our anti-crime effort.",
            "The amendments will permit sharing without the need for a formal arrangement, such as a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between STRO and its foreign counterpart, as long as the safeguards for the use and confidentiality of the information are secured through an undertaking by the foreign authority. This aligns us with the practices of key foreign jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the United States and Switzerland, which also do not require MOUs to share intelligence.",
            "Sir, I will now touch briefly on the other amendments proposed in the Bill.",
            "Clause 2(e) aligns the definition of \"financial institution\" with the corresponding definition under the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act or MAS Act to ensure consistency in coverage.",
            "As dispute adjudicators, arbitrators also have access to confidential information in the course of their work. Clause 8(b) thus extends the exemption from suspicious transaction reporting to arbitrators in respect of any matter which came to their attention during arbitration proceedings. The exemption preserves confidentiality, which is essential in the arbitration process. Established arbitration jurisdictions like the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia similarly exempt arbitrators from reporting suspicious transactions.",
            "Lastly, the Bill makes some technical amendments. For example, the term \"drug dealing\" is preferred to \"drug trafficking\" in describing the predicate drug offences in the CDSA, as it better reflects the drug-related offences scheduled in the CDSA by covering activities beyond trafficking, such as unauthorised drug manufacturing.",
            "Sir, money laundering is a sophisticated international scourge that requires a comprehensive suite of counter-measures to effectively detect and combat. To prevent such criminal activities from taking root in our financial system, our laws have to remain up-to-date, possess sufficient deterrence and facilitate international cooperation.",
            "The proposed amendments strengthen these aspects of our legislation and enhance our ability to take enforcement action against money laundering. They are also in line with international practices and standards and signal our resolute commitment to the global anti-money laundering effort. Sir, I beg to move."

          "speaker": "Mr Hri Kumar Nair",
          "content": [
            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. The Bill aims to strengthen our fight against money laundering and terrorism financing. It is good for two main reasons.",
            "First, its importance to Singapore's continued growth as a major offshore financial centre cannot be overstated. As an international financial and investment centre, we are vulnerable to cross-border money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The Singapore National Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report issued in January this year revealed that while we do have tough laws and regulations in place, more can be done in certain sectors which lack the relevant legislative and supervisory framework. The Bill, therefore, represents our continuous efforts to keep our laws relevant and effective.",
            "Second, this Bill tightens the regulation of money flows in accordance with the international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force, an inter-governmental body that Singapore has been a member of since 1992. It complements the recent changes made to the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act (TSOFA) in relation to terrorism financing in 2013, and it is, therefore, another step in a series of regulatory reforms taken to honour our international commitments.",
            "That said, I wish to raise two points of clarification.",
            "First, section 40A of the current CDSA serves to protect \"informers\". And this, in the Bill, clause 9 amends section 40A(4) of the Act such that it will read: \"In this section, \"informer\" means a person who makes a disclosure pursuant to a requirement under section 3A(3) or pursuant to section 39(1).\" The new section 3A(3) refers to persons who are required by the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Officer (STRO) to disclose documents or information, while section 39(1) refers to persons under a duty to disclose their knowledge or suspicion where such information or matter on which the knowledge or suspicion is based came to his attention in the course of his trade, profession, business or employment.",
            "The question is whether the law affords protection to a voluntary \"informer\", someone who reports his knowledge or suspicion of money laundering even if he is not required under a law to do so is not under the duty to do so. The wording of the provision indicates otherwise. Should we not encourage more people to come forward and afford them protection from civil claims? How would this tie in with protections for whistle-blowers? Could the Minister clarify, therefore, the intended scope of the provision?",
            "Second, section 39(1) of the CDSA. I accept this is not part of the amendment of the Bill but important for its understanding. Section 39(1) of the CDSA places an obligation on a person to disclose knowledge or suspicion of any act which may constitute drug dealing or criminal conduct should the pertinent information come to his attention in the course of his trade, profession, business or employment. \"Criminal conduct\" in this provision refers to \"any act constituting a serious offence or a foreign serious offence\", and \"serious offence\" encompasses a whole host of offences as specified in the Second Schedule of the CDSA.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, it can be argued that this provision casts too wide a net – it deals with an array of offences that are not likely to have anything to do with money laundering, terrorism or drug dealing. Indeed, the Second Schedule includes the offence of importing fresh fruits or vegetables without a licence under section 7 of the Control of Plants Act, the offence of importing or manufacturing animal feeds without a licence under section 4(5) of the Feeding Stuffs Act, and the offence of supplying adulterated or counterfeit health products under section 16 of the Health Products Act.",
            "The result of such an overly inclusive provision is that institutions, such as banks, will have to shoulder the onerous burden of reporting details of such seemingly disparate and wide-ranging offences. This might unnecessarily hinder the productivity of these institutions and result in indiscriminate reporting. Could the Minister help explain the reasoning behind such a wide definition of \"serious offence\"?",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, while the proposed amendments do indeed help to facilitate the detection and prosecution of money laundering offences, we must continue to monitor local risks, such as the use of our casinos or even property purchases as a possible vehicle for money laundering. We also need to keep pace with threats brought about by technology. Technology has created new vehicles for money laundering, such as digital currency like bitcoins, or even virtual goods in online gaming that have real cash value. In this regard, I note that MAS has already taken some steps to regulate virtual currency intermediaries for money laundering and terrorism financing risks. I support the Bill."

          "content": [
            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as crimes are increasingly cross-border and the proceeds of crime are easily anonymised, it is important that we continue to address weaknesses that may make Singapore an unwitting facilitator of organised and transnational crime. To this end, the global Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has been prolific in its issuance of guidelines and mutual evaluations to help countries tighten up their system weaknesses. Singapore has been subject to such evaluations and criticisms by FATF, and has been responding to them.",
            "In recent years, the Government has introduced or supported due diligence and reporting requirements to specific sectors that may facilitate money laundering, for example, corporate service providers and the legal profession. On the enforcement side, the Director of the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) recently revealed in a Business Times interview on 30 June 2014 that CAD had tripled its financial investigation resources as it was seeing a trend of overseas criminals seeking to launder money through Singapore bank accounts.",
            "Given the challenges we face as an open economy, the amendments being proposed in this Bill are another anti-money laundering measure meant to bring Singapore in further compliance with the many recommendations of FATF. I support the principles of the Bill.",
            "That said, I have some comments and clarifications about two aspects of the Bill. First, cash transaction reporting for precious stones and metal dealers and, second, substitute property confiscation orders.",
            "First, cash transaction reporting for precious stones and metal dealers. Clause 19 introduces a new Part VIB on Cash Transaction Reports. This Part will require prescribed persons to perform customer due diligence and internal control measures before entering cash transactions exceeding a prescribed amount. Though the class of persons has not yet been prescribed, it is clear from the Ministry's media release of 28 May this year that it is to apply to dealers of precious stones and metals (PSMDs).",
            "PSMDs are within the FATF list of Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions considered vulnerable to money laundering. Diamonds and gold are high-value commodities. FATF noted in a special report in 2013 – the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Through Trade in Diamonds, October 2013 – that by changing proceeds of crime into diamonds and jewellery, criminals can conceal proceeds of crime over long periods of time to avoid seizure and confiscation, transfer very high value across borders while keeping their investment relatively safe and use them as a form of payment later. Alternatively, it has been found that syndicates may use the bank accounts of diamond dealers as conduits to transfer large sums of money to persons not in the diamond trade. Domestically, the Government has identified pawnbrokers as a sector needing attention, as they are dealing in gold on a cash basis.",
            "It thus makes sense to require PSMDs to take extra care that they are not unwitting accomplices in money laundering by criminals. However, in order for businesses to do due diligence and suspicious transaction reporting, they need to have a sound understanding of the risks and be able to exercise sound judgement. Businesses would clearly benefit from information sharing by Government authorities on matters, such as which countries are of higher risk, how money launderers have abused dealers in actual cases and even certain intelligence information.",
            "The requirements placed on such businesses should also not be too onerous as there are compliance costs involved; businesses would need to build expertise through training, need to seek professional advice and keep records.",
            "I understand that at a recent local seminar on \"Know Your Customer\" requirements, even corporate service providers, like corporate secretarial firms, were wary and worried about how to do risk-based assessments of their clients, the extent of record-keeping needed and how much their business costs would increase.",
            "PSMDs in Singapore encompass a wide range of businesses, from those with international reputations like De Beers to small family-owned gold or jewellery businesses and pawn shops. Requiring such businesses to assess the risk of their customers and to do appropriate reporting and tracing may be novel and unfamiliar. The proposed reporting requirements appear rules-based, requiring reporting of cash transactions above a certain value. How far will PSMDs be required to assess risk rather than just follow rules? How will the Suspicious Transactions Reporting Office (STRO) or other Government agency assist such dealers to understand what is required and to make any necessary risk assessments?",
            "One final observation about PSMDs. Under the Bill, due diligence is required only for cash transactions. However, in a report by FATF last year, it was noted that the usage of cash in the diamond trade had diminished. Almost 50% of laundering cases reported concerned non-cash payments, such as wired funds and credit terms, while only 10% of cases seen involved cash as the sole method of payment. In this regard, FATF observed that there might be a need to scrutinise non-cash transactions as well.",
            "Next, Sir, I move on to substitute property confiscation orders. Under the existing Act, proceeds or benefits of crime are liable for confiscation. Clause 5 of this Bill introduces a new Part IVA on Substitute Property Confiscation Orders, which will apply when a defendant has used or intended to use any property, called \"an instrumentality\", to commit the offence and the instrumentality is not in the hands of the defendant. The new provisions will allow confiscation of other properties of the defendant of equivalent value to the instrumentality. An example would be where a defendant used a car to deliver drugs and the car is not in the defendant's ownership. The new section 29B would enable the Court to confiscate other properties belonging to the defendant of equivalent value to the car, say, money in the bank or furniture. In addition, the new section 29B (3) and (4) make clear that the substitute confiscation order will be for the defendant to pay the full value of the instrumentality, that is, the full value of the car. Thus, if the substitute property confiscated is realised for less than the full value of the car, the defendant is still liable to pay the difference.",
            "The wording of section 29B makes it mandatory for the Court to make the substitute confiscation order if the Public Prosecutor applies for it.",
            "Sir, provisions for confiscation of substitute property are found in the laws of other countries as well. Their purpose is to ensure that crime does not pay, by reducing the economic incentives and increasing the pecuniary loss from criminal activity. While I appreciate the efficacy of such provisions to cripple syndicates financially, I believe the clause, as worded in the Bill, could operate too harshly in certain circumstances.",
            "First, under the Bill, the instrumentality used to or intended to be used to commit the crime need not have belonged to the defendant at all, as the section simply requires that the defendant used or intended to use \"any property\" for the crime. Secondly, property used for the crime can encompass a wide range of scenarios. Under the CDSA, \"property\" is defined to include \"money and all other property, movable or immovable\". Property used to facilitate crime thus includes not just firearms or getaway vehicles, but even premises used for commission of the crime. Thirdly, the property used or intended to be used for commission of the crime may have been used just once for the crime but was generally used for legitimate purposes, for example, a flat used as a dwelling. To take the example of a flat being used for drug dealing, if section 29B is triggered, the defendant will be liable to pay the full value of a flat he may have no share in.",
            "By comparison, the model policy for confiscation of substitute assets proposed by the American Legislative Exchange Council allows asset substitution only if the State proves by a preponderance of evidence that the defendant intentionally transferred, sold or deposited property with a third party to avoid the court's jurisdiction.",
            "In the Ministry's press release of 28 May on the Bill, there was a mention that the substitute property confiscation order is meant to apply where the defendant has dissipated or disposed of the instruments of crime. However, in the Bill itself, the section will kick in so long as the instrument of crime is not held by the defendant; there need not be any dissipation by him.",
            "Sir, I have no issue with the benefits of crime and instruments of crime being subject to a confiscation order in every case. However, in the case of substitute confiscation orders, the confiscation of other property of equivalent value to an instrumentality is less clear-cut for the reasons I mentioned. It seems that the Public Prosecutor is expected to be the gatekeeper of this provision, since he is the one who decides whether to apply for the substitute confiscation order. Even so, would it not have been possible to give the cCurt limited discretion to refuse to make the orders if they would operate unjustly in particular cases? At least, the defendant should be allowed to make some representations to the Xourt before his substitute assets are confiscated."

            ": Allow me to declare my interest as a banker and also the co-chair of the private banking industry group alongside the MAS. I will focus on the issues in this Bill pertaining to tax crimes and the implications for the Singapore financial sector as well as other parts of our economy. I will also focus on some of the implementation challenges arising from this Bill.",
            "The proposed amendments to this Bill in relation to tax make important clarifications to Singapore's framework to combat tax evasion. I support the timeliness, relevance and importance of this Bill. It comes at a time when many jurisdictions around the world are focused on strengthening their tax evasion laws, enforcing anti-money laundering legislation and discussing international cooperation on tax and exchange of information.",
            "This Bill enables certain types of foreign tax offences to be treated as serious offences, whether or not the foreign tax concerned is a type that is imposed in Singapore. This means any suspicion of tax illicit funds should be reported without having to worry about what specific type of taxes have been evaded.",
            "This Bill, if implemented correctly, will promote Singapore as a financial centre with a strong legal framework. It will also help counter concerns that Singapore is a \"tax haven\" and avoid the reputational damage suffered by some other financial centres.",
            "Let us not forget that Singapore has worked hard to build our financial hub. We are, today, a successful financial centre precisely because of our strong governance structure and legal framework. Many international customers choose to bank here because it is a safe place to bank.",
            "In recent years, both the regulator here and the financial industry have taken steps to combat tax evasion. The MAS has been proactive and adopted a consultative approach to guide the industry along a suitable path for the long term. Under this guidance, financial institutions have undertaken comprehensive reviews of their customer accounts for tax illicit monies. But we must be able to strike a balance if we are to be successful. The country, in a need to uphold its solid reputation, cannot threaten the individual's rights to safeguard his or her assets. As global pressure mounts to clamp down on supposed tax cheats and countries feel compelled to cooperate internationally, there also need to be safeguards in place to prevent abuse. At the same time, Singapore must ensure its banking industry is not disadvantaged.",
            "Whilst the Bill is clear in its concepts, the implementation may give rise to some concerns. This is where correct interpretation or enforcement comes in to play. So, what are the challenges?",
            "Firstly, there lies the issue of clarity in understanding what constitutes tax evasion. Financial institutions are required to file an STR when it is \"uncertain\" if an act of evasion is committed. In practice, it is a matter of judgement if something amounts to \"tax planning\", \"tax avoidance\" or \"tax evasion\". Only the last is reportable. Hence, more guidance is needed here in terms of the distinction between tax avoidance and tax planning. The MAS must, therefore, in practice, ensure it allows an avenue for banks to ask generic questions about whether a case pattern is a reportable event.",
            "There may be instances, too, where a supposed tax crime filing may be politically motivated by a government going after whom they may deem to be their political foes.",
            "Another specific practical concern arises with the requirement to file an STR when foreign tax laws may have been violated, even if the same act was not considered tax evasion here in Singapore. Whilst a global bank with branches in every country may have the ability to make such assessments at some cost and resource, smaller regional banks or local banks may not. Hence, some care must be taken when enforcing this principle.",
            "Secondly, there is the potential issue of over-reporting. Over reporting is not \"cost-free\" or risk-free for a bank as its clients could be wrongly singled out and get requests via IRAS. Hence, FIs are caught in a situation where STR filing too little could be non-compliant but reporting too frequently would lead to loss of competitiveness. This can only be dealt with via a more rigorous onboarding and Know Your Customer process which could also be expensive and difficult to implement.",
            "The third challenge lies in the rising costs of compliance for smaller industry players. There is also the cost of training to raise staff awareness of tax crimes. FIs have to hire more transaction monitoring and AML/Compliance staff. These costs all add up. Whilst bigger global or local banks are able to provide adequate resources for this, many smaller FIs may not be able to.",
            "Hence, allow me to offer two suggestions at this juncture. The first is to allow perhaps, the setting up of a common facility or shared resource for these smaller players. The second is made in the context of Singapore being a global financial centre – for us to leverage off big data analytics globally and to work with other such centres to better track the illegal movement of funds across borders.",
            "Fourthly is the issue of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). The Bill, as such, does fit in well with the increased global focus on BEPS – the 15-point action plan sponsored by the G20 and supported by OECD. Whilst we have yet to see the full extent of this plan, no doubt, more will emerge. Global firms like Google, Starbucks, Apple have come under scrutiny for having complex tax structures that helped them save millions on their tax bills. These structures were perfectly legal but this perceived tax avoidance has now become a moral issue. Again, here, more clarity on such cases will be needed.",
            "The fifth issue is the movement of tax illicit funds into non-banks. Whilst banks and financial institutions are tightly regulated by a clear set of industry standard protocol, other industries that deal in payments and transactions may not be governed by the same stringent criteria, for example, telcos and online payment companies that deal with money flows that bypass the banking system daily. Money launderers have wised up to the fact that banks cannot hide them from the law and some may find other avenues to hide their wealth, for example, in high-end properties, precious metals, gold bars, diamonds and so on. How will such money flows be monitored?",
            "Lastly, the digital economy and the rise of the virtual currency. With the onset of the digital revolution and the increasing popularity of virtual currencies as a store of value and a means of online transactions, the Bill may need to look at the potential risk of how convertible virtual currencies that are exchanged for real money can become vulnerable to tax evasion or money laundering. The increasing use of such virtual currencies, for example, the bitcoin, would create a whole new payment system that could potentially offer more anonymity, perhaps, than traditional forms of transactions and payment systems today.",
            "Finally, the Bill addresses the need for additional powers to be bestowed on the Suspicious Transactions Reporting Office (STRO). I am supportive of this move but will suggest that STRO be as transparent as it can possibly be about its role and where data may go or be used. A lack of clarity may cause undue concern for those filing reports. Hence, an open relationship between the FIs and STRO and perhaps an ability for FIs to engage STRO to obtain some guidance or pre-clearance on selected cases would be useful and will ensure the filing of high quality STRs. Similar set-ups abroad, called Financial Intelligence Units, already exist in other countries and we can learn more about them – of the difficulties they have faced.",
            "Sir, this Bill does help Singapore safeguard our nation's reputation and sets high standards for governance and, hence, I support the Bill."

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of this Bill, especially in the current globalised, high technology and high travel climate. The enhancement of the maximum penalty for money laundering of up to 10 years of imprisonment will, hopefully, serve as a strong deterrent factor.",
            "Also importantly, as we are debating this Bill, it is a call to financial institutions to continually review and monitor their processes and checking mechanisms, to prevent serious tax crimes.",
            "I have a few queries to raise.",
            "Firstly, pertaining to \"transnational crime and money laundering\" activities, how are we most often alerted to these? Is it via Intelligence units, the Interpol, individuals, companies or the financial institutions themselves? Also, on average, how many such cases are there currently in Singapore?",
            "Secondly, will there be any difference in the management and handling of these cases if they involve individuals compared to when they implicate groups, associations or companies? Will the penalties meted out also vary accordingly?",
            "Thirdly, pertaining to the amendments that state, I quote, \"it will allow the courts to order the confiscation of any other property of an equivalent value belonging to an offender, if he disposes such instruments of crime\", can I confirm if there will be a specific timeframe within which this can be or should be conducted?",
            "Fourthly, as there are currently no internationally accepted standardised regulations for legislation that cuts across all countries and jurisdictions, we may still risk running into queries and uncertainties when handling cases. What will then be the best course of rapid action in such cases? And this should be available 24 hours, I assume.",
            "Finally, with our open borders and economy, as well as our good standing as one of the important financial centres in the region and globally, everyone, especially our financial institutions, must remain vigilant at all times."

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill. Presently, the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act or CDSA criminalises the laundering of benefits derived from proceeds of criminal offences and provides the relevant authorities with the power to investigate and confiscate such proceeds of crime. This entrusts enforcement authorities with the power and authority to clamp down on the use of these criminal proceeds to perpetuate further crimes in and around Singapore.",
            "In an effort to ensure consistency in our laws and to step up measures to combat the increasing scourge of transnational financial crimes in Singapore and the surrounding region, MHA has tabled an amendment to the CDSA to enhance the detection and prosecution of money laundering offences, increase the deterrent effect of our laws, and to facilitate information sharing with foreign financial intelligence units.",
            "I support this Bill for two reasons. First, the amendments that have been proposed in this Bill are timely. They ensure that Singapore's laws remain relevant in combating transnational financial crimes like money laundering. Secondly, the establishment of the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO) ensures that there is a focused and coordinated effort to monitor, investigate and deal with offenders. It also facilitates information sharing between local and foreign financial intelligence units. Such information sharing is key to deterring transnational crime.",
            "First, the Government must ensure that our laws are relevant and effective in combating the scourge of transnational financial crimes like money laundering and terrorist financing, and reducing their prevalence on our shores. In order to achieve this, this Bill provides for a two-pronged approach to effectively deal with these serious transnational crimes; through strong and firm deterrent penalties and the provision of robust investigation and enforcement powers for regulatory and enforcement authorities.",
            "In terms of deterrence, this Bill proposes to increase the maximum imprisonment term for money laundering offences from seven to 10 years, consistent with the maximum penalty for terrorist financing under the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act. The increased penalties for an offender convicted of money laundering offences indicate how firm and decisively offenders of such crimes will be dealt with.",
            "Further, the proposed amendments aim to empower the Courts to order the confiscation of any property of an equivalent value belonging to the offender if he dissipates or disposes such instruments of crime. Essentially, with this proposed amendment, the Courts will have the power to issue a substitute property confiscation order against an offender, if it finds that the offender had used or intended to use any instrumentality for the commission of an offence, and the instrumentality, which is a phrase gleaned from clause 5 of the Bill, is no longer available for forfeiture.",
            "This enables the Courts to effectively cut off the financial links of these transnational syndicates and to deprive offenders of their ill-gotten gains. This is essential to counter the recent increase in occurrence of syndicated financial crimes and will serve to minimise and possibly eliminate the occurrence of these offences and crimes and syndicates in the longer term.",
            "Taken together, the harsher penalties for money laundering offences and the wider ambit of power given to the Courts to tackle syndicated crimes will have a firm and effective deterrent effect on offenders who will now, I think, think twice before committing such offences on our shores.",
            "Further, the proposed amendments provide robust investigation and enforcement powers for regulatory and enforcement authorities. This is facilitated through the establishment of STRO, which is primarily responsible for the receipt and analysis of any information that would be relevant towards the investigation of serious crimes like corruption, drug trafficking and money laundering. By creating a specialised team that focuses on the investigation and enforcement of such crimes, there can be a focused and coordinated effort to monitor, investigate and deal with the offenders of such crimes.",
            "The proposed Bill also empowers officers attached to STRO with the power to require any person to disclose documents and information for the purposes of analysis and investigation. This will be an important tool to enable investigation authorities to obtain key information that would expedite its investigations and to act quickly in dealing with suspected offenders. This is particularly essential when dealing with complex financial crimes.",
            "However, despite the wide-ranging powers entrusted to STRO and its officers, the Bill ensures that these investigations respect legal professional privilege, except where any such communication, item or document was made, prepared or held with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose. This will ensure consistency of the proposed amendments to the CDSA with existing evidential laws.",
            "All in all, the CDS (Amendment) Bill provides a two-pronged approach to ensuring that our laws continue to be relevant and effective in combating the scourge of transnational financial crimes like money laundering and terrorist financing, especially in the fast-paced and ever-changing criminal landscape.",
            "Secondly, the CDS (Amendment) Bill goes further in facilitating a focused and coordinated transnational effort to investigate and deal with offenders of such crimes.",
            "Beyond merely increasing the investigation and enforcement powers of enforcement agencies in Singapore, the Bill creates and facilitates avenues for STRO and its officers to share information and intelligence with foreign financial intelligence units. This will assist in creating a fertile and collaborative environment for enforcement agencies to clamp down on transnational financial crimes through free and open intelligence sharing amongst intelligence units. This further step will be particularly important in light of the establishment of the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore and its expected operationalisation in 2014. And if possible, with respect, I would like the Minister's views on whether INTERPOL Global Complex being in Singapore will actually augment STRO in this regard.",
            "With the increasingly challenging and fast-paced operational landscape, local and foreign enforcement agencies and intelligence units must ensure that there is a collaborative framework in place to facilitate the timely exchange, the quick exchange and the vital exchange of information and intelligence. Without such an exchange, without the fluidity of information sharing, this Bill will not achieve its purpose.",
            "With the enactment of this Bill, STRO, together with other local intelligence units, will be able to work alongside foreign financial intelligence units to confront and stop the proliferation of such serious transnational financial crimes in Singapore and the surrounding region.",
            "Further, a collaborative approach to investigation and information sharing provides an opportunity for the sharing of best practices amongst various units, which will serve to enhance the capabilities and capacity of STRO and other local intelligence units.",
            "While the creation of a collaborative framework between local and foreign financial intelligence units must be applauded, could the Minister kindly clarify as to what safeguards will be put in place to ensure that information obtained and shared by our STRO is not abused or wrongfully disclosed? Given that the investigation and enforcement of such crimes and the proposed collaborative framework come under the purview of various Ministries, such as MHA, MinLaw and MFA, I would like to ask the Minister for clarification on which Ministry STRO will be established under and which Ministry will spearhead the Government's effort to deter the relevant crimes?",
            "Taken together, the proposed amendments to the CDSA and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA), and the enactment of the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act in August 2013, enhance Singapore's leading role in the wider global effort to curb money laundering and terrorist financing. By being able to cut off and confiscate the financial benefit of such crimes, while also preserving Singapore's status as a banking hub, which is the position taken by Ms Tan Su Shan, local authorities will be able to deter and curb the prevalence of these transnational crimes on our shores and in the region. Essentially, the Bill that is before Parliament today is but a piece of a much larger effort by the Government to combat transnational and syndicated crimes.",
            "Moving forward, in order for Singapore to maintain its leading role in the fight against serious crimes like drug trafficking, terrorist financing and money laundering, or even corruption, we must ensure that our laws are kept current and relevant, as we are doing today, towards dealing with the emerging and fast-changing criminal landscape.

The points that Members have raised fall broadly into three themes and I will endeavour to address them in turn.",
            "The first pertains to the scope of the CDSA and the reporting requirements. Mr Hri Kumar asked whether the wide list of predicate offences captured by the CDSA would impose an unduly onerous reporting requirement on financial institutions. Sir, the CDSA's current list of more than 400 serious offences is in line with international standards and expectations. The FATF prescribes designated categories of offences which include fraud, corruption, forgery, illicit trafficking in stolen and other goods, and counterfeiting and piracy of products.",
            "These categories include the specific offences highlighted by Mr Hri Kumar. It is internationally recognised and acknowledged that such offences – while they may seem rather extensive in the way they have been described – pose a material risk in terms of the potential to generate illicit proceeds for laundering. Hence, the need to list them in the Schedule. And the provisions in the CDSA provide the basis for our law enforcement agencies to commence prosecution if there is evidence of money laundering and to confiscate criminal benefits derived from such conduct.",
            "Ms Tan Su Shan stressed the importance of giving financial institutions, particularly the smaller ones, guidance in determining what constitutes suspicious transactions involving foreign tax offences, so that they do not fall afoul of the CDSA's reporting requirements.",
            "We recognise that this is a developing area for financial institutions, given that these requirements were only imposed last year. The Suspicious Transactions Reporting Office (STRO) has conducted workshops on combating crimes, including tax crimes, as part of its outreach efforts. STRO has disseminated guidance notes with case studies and suspicious indicators on tax crimes and related money laundering. Financial institutions may also seek clarification from STRO, which the Member raised, or industry regulators where needed.",
            "MAS has also been working with the industry to provide feedback and guidance on sound industry practices. This includes engagement with industry associations, such as the Association of Banks Singapore and the private banking industry. Most recently, on 16 June this year, MAS published the guidance on private banking controls which sets out best practices and areas to assist financial institutions to mitigate their risks.",
            "What constitutes tax evasion under the CDSA is clearly set out in the definition for \"foreign serious tax offence\" and comprises the same elements as our domestic tax evasion offences under the Income Tax Act and the Goods and Services Tax Act. The aim, ultimately, as Ms Tan has described, is to promote the filing of quality suspicious transactions reports and, in the process, heighten our vigilance against potential criminal activities.",
            "I must say, though, that while we are open to suggestions, such as shared facilities and so on, on how to further help smaller financial institutions comply with these requirements, I must emphasise that, ultimately, it is the responsibility of each financial institution operating in a global financial centre like Singapore to ensure that it has the necessary controls in place. Compliance to a high quality regulatory regime is, indeed, the advantage that a financial centre like us can provide and, in turn, enhance the competitive advantage of the institutions that operate in our environment.",
            "With regard to the Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan, as a responsible jurisdiction, Singapore is fully committed to work with other jurisdictions to fight cross-border tax offences. We note that that the BEPS recommendations have not been finalised and their impact is still uncertain. The Government will continue to monitor international developments and participate in relevant international discussions on the issue.",
            "We share Ms Tan's concern about the need to closely monitor non-finance sectors beyond financial institutions that are susceptible to money laundering activities. I should highlight that non-financial sectors are subject to the same requirements – as indeed are all other entities – to report suspicious transactions in the same way as financial institutions, as the requirement to file suspicious transaction reports (STRs) apply to everyone who comes across them in the course of work.",
            "In January this year, Singapore published a National Risk Assessment report that covered the money laundering and terrorist financing risks of both the financial and non-financial sectors. The stored value facilities of online payment companies are among the areas that have been identified in the report as being of higher risk and they are already subject to specific anti-money laundering and terrorism financing requirements.",
            "Another area that Ms Tan has highlighted is the virtual currency space. This was also highlighted in the National Risk Assessment report as an area for further study. In March this year, MAS announced that intermediaries that buy, sell or facilitate the exchange of virtual currencies will be regulated for anti-money laundering measures. MAS is currently studying the appropriate regulatory regime to be put in place and will consult the industry in due course.",
            "Ms Sylvia Lim has asked whether and how Precious Stones and Metals Dealers (PSMDs) are required to assess risk on top of the proposed cash transaction reporting requirements, and if there is a need to scrutinise the non-cash aspects of their transactions as well. The focus is on cash transactions as they pose a higher risk, compared to non-cash transactions. Cash transactions, for example, allow the transacting parties to preserve anonymity and this is a key issue. Non-cash transactions will generally pass through financial institutions that already have anti-money laundering controls in place. Further, the current suspicious transaction reporting requirements apply also to PSMDs and cover their cash and non-cash transactions. So, if there is reasonable suspicion, they should report it.",
            "I want to assure the Member that STRO has held several rounds of discussions with trade associations in the PSMD industry and will continue to engage the industry to address any concerns or doubts pertaining to reporting and other requirements. But I do want to make the point again about compliance. The point about compliance cost was raised by Ms Lim as well.",
            "The tighter the focus, the lesser the compliance cost. The larger the focus – if we extend the coverage to non-cash transactions by PMSDs – then the burden in terms of compliance will be far greater. So, I think in coming up with these legislative amendments and the regulatory elements that will give force to them, we are trying to find the balance that will impose a reasonable burden of compliance on the industry players in order to preserve the overall integrity of the system, which is something that they all value as an asset for their business.",
            "Sir, the second theme of Members' queries and comments is on international cooperation. Mr Hri Kumar has described that Singapore is an open economy with advanced technological linkages and we are, therefore, particularly vulnerable to cross border money laundering risks. Almost 30% of our money laundering convictions in the past five years involved predicate offences that were committed outside Singapore. Effective international cooperation is key to our enforcement efforts.",
            "Our agencies' ability to cooperate internationally is also subject to legal safeguards and procedures to ensure that such cooperation is legitimate and the information is kept confidential and not misused.",
            "Mr de Souza asked about the safeguards in place to ensure that information obtained and shared by STRO is not abused or wrongfully disclosed. Under the proposed amendments, as a prerequisite for information sharing, a foreign authority would need to give an undertaking and assure us of confidentiality and that the information would be used only for the purposes of advancing investigations. The foreign authority must provide sufficient detail on the offence being investigated and explain how the information that is requested is relevant to the investigation. Further, STRO officers cannot disclose information obtained for the exercise of its functions unless it is relevant to an investigation or when they are compelled to do so by the Court or any written law. So, there is a ring of safeguards around how the information can be shared and how it can be utilised.",
            "Members have also raised questions pertaining to investigations and enforcement. Mr de Souza asked about the reporting structure of STRO and which agency will spearhead efforts against money laundering. STRO will continue to be embedded within the Commercial Affairs Department as one of its key Divisions. CAD is the main enforcement agency for money laundering under MHA. At the policy level, our anti-money laundering regime is overseen by a multi-agency Steering Committee, which is co-led by MHA, MOF and MAS.",
            "On the question of INTERPOL, clearly, as part of the effort to work with international bodies and international corporations, INTERPOL's presence here will be an asset but, operationally, they will have to work out how they will give effect to such cooperation and whether the specific siting of INTERPOL's offices here will bring particular benefits.",
            "Assoc Prof Fatimah asked how our law enforcement authorities are alerted to transnational crime and money laundering activities. Generally, information can be received from foreign intelligence units or law enforcement agencies on criminal activity that may have a bearing on Singapore.",
            "Other sources of valuable intelligence are the suspicious transaction reports filed with STRO, as well as reports/complaints lodged by individuals and companies. Our agencies follow up and commence investigations where possible criminal activity is disclosed, with a view towards eventual prosecution. As I had mentioned before, there were 39 successful money laundering prosecutions in 2013.",
            "Assoc Prof Fatimah has also asked if there are any differences in the handling of money laundering cases if they involve individuals as compared to organisations. The CAD does not make such a distinction and will pursue each case based on the facts to identify the perpetrators and determine their culpability. If an individual is found to have acted on behalf of, or at the direction of an organisation, then he and the entity will be taken to task. These considerations are enumerated in sections 52 and 59 of the CDSA.",
            "With regard to money laundering penalties, the CDSA prescribes distinct penalties for individuals and organisations under sections 44 to 47. An individual faces a fine not exceeding $500,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years while an organisation faces a fine not exceeding $1 million. The actual penalties meted out depend on the severity of the offence, monetary amount involved and the number of charges levied.",
            "I will now move on to some specific questions that Members have raised on the Bill or on the CDSA provisions.",
            "On the power to confiscate property of corresponding value in place of instruments of crime, Assoc Prof Fatimah has asked if there is a specific timeframe for the application of the new substitute property confiscation order. The CDSA does not provide for a specific timeframe within which the process must be conducted. In practice, it will be carried out as soon as possible after the defendant's conviction. This is similar to the current practice for confiscation of criminal benefits.",
            "Ms Sylvia Lim opined that the proposed substitute property confiscation orders could be too harsh in certain circumstances. I think we have to balance this against the need to have a strong deterrence against such crimes – a point that Mr Hri Kumar has also mentioned. The intent of the provision is precisely to preserve that deterrent element so that criminals are deterred from being able to use any instrument to commit offences and escape the consequences simply because, for example, these instruments do not belong to them. We want to ensure that there is a strong deterrent effect there.",
            "The limited discretion given to the Courts is in line with the approach taken for the confiscation of criminal benefits under sections 4 and 5 of the CDSA, the confiscation of property controlled by terrorists under the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act, and the imposition of a monetary penalty under the Prevention of Corruption Act.",
            "I want to assure Members that the same stringent requirements apply to a substitute property confiscation order as they would a normal confiscation order against criminal benefits under Parts II, III and IV of the CDSA. First, the offender must be convicted of a drug dealing or serious offence. Second, the application for a substitute property confiscation order must be made by the Public Prosecutor to the Court after careful assessment that it is commensurate with the severity of the crime. So, yes, the Public Prosecutor is the gatekeeper, as Ms Lim has characterised. But it is an important responsibility and it has to be with reference to the severity of the crime. The Court has to be satisfied that the offender had used or intended to use the instrumentality for the commission of the offence, and that instrumentality is not available for forfeiture. The power cannot be invoked where the actual instrument of crime is available. In addition, the quantum payable is also an amount that the Court assesses to be the value of the instrumentality and is imposed as a monetary fine. It does not allow the Public Prosecutor, therefore, to cherry pick and choose other property to confiscate.",
            "So, there is a range of safeguards in place and these have already been applied in practice, and, in considering whether to apply for a substitute property confiscation order, the Public Prosecutor will consider the full facts and circumstances of the case and the totality of the actions taken to punish the defendant and deprive him of his criminal proceeds.",
            "Mr Hri Kumar asked for clarification on the protection accorded to persons who inform STRO of suspicious transactions. Section 39 imposes a general duty on all persons to report their suspicions if they come across information in the course of their work that a property was used or intended to be used to commit crime. A person who discloses such information in good faith to a STRO officer is protected from liability for any loss arising out of the disclosure under section 39(6) of the CDSA. He would be considered an \"informer\" under section 40A, which provides for protection of the person's identity and the information disclosed. This covers the vast majority of the suspicious transaction reports received.",
            "Nevertheless, I agree with Mr Hri Kumar. He makes a good point on extending such protection to any persons who disclose information voluntarily outside the circumstances described in section 39. We will study this further to see what can be done.",
            "Sir, I think I have covered the substantive points that Members have raised. Once again, I want to thank all of them for speaking on the Bill and for their general support, and for their useful comments and feedback which will inform the implementation of the provisions of the Bill and any subsequent review that we undertake.",
            "Sir, the enhanced CDSA will allow our agencies to better prevent illicit monies from flowing through Singapore, deter associated criminal activities and facilitate cooperation with the international community. These amendments also bring us into greater compliance with international standards and signal clearly our commitment to the global anti-money laundering fight. Collectively, these efforts will uphold the integrity and reputation for our financial sector, which Singapore has painstakingly built over the years. I urge Members to give your full support to the Bill. Sir, I beg to move."

            ": Mr Deputy Speaker,\tI beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"",
            "Sir, the proposed amendments to the Copyright Act are to achieve two objectives.",
            "First, to afford persons with reading disabilities greater opportunities to access copyrighted works in line with the Marrakesh Treaty.",
            "Second, to combat online piracy by allowing rights owners to more effectively seek Court orders to disable access to pirate websites.",
            "Let me first address the provisions relating to the Marrakesh Treaty.",
            "The Marrakesh Treaty, concluded under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), seeks to facilitate access to copyrighted works for persons with reading disabilities. Member States of WIPO adopted the Treaty in June last year.",
            "Singapore is committed to ensuring that our intellectual property (IP) regime serves the needs of the visually-impaired community. We will be signing and ratifying the Marrakesh Treaty by the end of this year. These amendments will put us in a position to meet the obligations of the Marrakesh Treaty.",
            "Let me now highlight four main amendments that the Bill makes in relation to the Treaty.",
            "First, the Bill allows persons with reading disabilities, as well as any person or institution acting on their behalf, to produce copies of the copyright-protected material in formats which persons with reading disabilities can access.",
            "At present, converting copyrighted material into other formats, including formats suitable for persons with reading disabilities, requires the permission of rights holders. Only two institutions that assist persons with reading disabilities, namely, the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped and the Lighthouse School, need not obtain such permission.",
            "Clause 2 amends the Act to allow a broader category of persons and institutions to create accessible format copies without requiring permission from the rights holder. This could include persons with reading disabilities; and education institutions and institutions assisting them, such as SG Enable and the Society for the Physically Disabled.",
            "Second, the Bill allows copyrighted material to be converted into any format, so that these formats are accessible to persons with reading disabilities. Presently, the Act only allows copyrighted material to be converted to a limited range of prescribed formats. These formats are restricted to sound recordings, Braille, large-print and photographic versions of the said material.",
            "Clause 2 broadens this range to encompass all formats that could assist persons with reading disabilities. Take, for instance, DAISY, or the Digital Accessible Information System. DAISY is an audio substitute for print material. It allows reading-disabled persons to navigate pages of audio books more easily. It is an increasingly popular format which the Act does not cater for. However, it would be covered under the proposed amendments.",
            "Third, in addition to literary and dramatic works, the Bill amends the Act to further allow artistic works, sound recordings and sound broadcasts to be converted into formats which are friendly to persons with reading disabilities. This will facilitate the conversion of audio books to reading disabled friendly formats like DAISY.",
            "Fourth, the Bill allows institutions assisting persons with reading disabilities, as well as educational institutions, to not only reproduce, but also distribute, import and produce for export such copies.",
            "At present, the Act only covers the making of copies. Copies which are friendly to persons with reading disabilities may, however, not be distributed or imported generally, although persons with reading disabilities may import such copies for their personal use. The ability to import is especially important for increasing access to works accessible to persons with reading disabilities.",
            "Singapore is not a major creator of such works. Allowing such works to be imported would, therefore, give the community much needed access to works from overseas institutions, such as the Royal Blind in the UK and the National Federation of the Blind in the US.",
            "To facilitate the distribution of such copies internationally, the Bill further allows institutions in Singapore, such as the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped and the Lighthouse School, to make copies for the purposes of exporting them.",
            "I turn next to the second aspect of the Bill, which seeks to empower rights owners to more effectively disable access to sites that flagrantly infringe copyright or pirate websites.",
            "Online piracy is a global issue and it affects us in Singapore as well.",
            "An independent 2012 survey by Vobile Pte Ltd found that Singapore ranked fourth out of 18 countries in Asia, and 12th out of 38 countries globally, in terms of the number of downloads of infringing content per Internet user.",
            "A 2013 survey conducted by Sycamore Research and Insight Asia also revealed that approximately three-quarters of our youth aged 19 to 24 consume copyright infringing material. Among the 900 respondents whom Sycamore Research polled late last year, the top reason for engaging in online piracy was that pirated content was available easily and for free.",
            "The prevalence of online piracy in Singapore turns customers away from legitimate content and adversely affects Singapore's creative sector. It can also undermine our reputation as a society that respects the protection of intellectual property.",
            "Digital music sales now make up a large percentage, about one-third, of music producers' total revenue. However, industry stakeholders tell us that the decline in physical music sales in Singapore has not been compensated by a commensurate rise in digital sales.",
            "The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has reported that the total music revenue in Singapore, consisting of both physical and digital sales, declined from $29.8 million in 2009 to $16.4 million last year.",
            "The decline in total music revenue could, therefore, affect the development of new musical talent in Singapore and stifle the growth of the creative industry. It could also keep providers of legitimate online content away from Singapore. We, therefore, need to take stronger measures against online piracy.",
            "Jurisdictions, such as the UK, Norway, Denmark and Belgium, have introduced legislation to permit the blocking of pirate websites. Denmark has been practising this for more than five years.",
            "Let me illustrate with the UK as an example. In the UK, the UK courts have, to date, ordered major network service providers to block access to more than 40 websites on grounds of copyright infringement. The list includes The Pirate Bay, a website notorious for its blatant infringement of copyright material. It has been blocked in many countries, including the UK, Belgium and Denmark. Just last month, Swedish authorities arrested Peter Sunde, a co-founder of The Pirate Bay who had been on the run for two years. He had been sentenced to eight months imprisonment by the Swedish courts for violating copyright laws in 2009.",
            "The battle against online copyright piracy is, as you can see, global. This Bill seeks to enable copyright owners in Singapore to better protect their rights in the online space.",
            "Before I take the House through the relevant provisions of the Bill, let me give an overview of the present system and the challenges rights holders currently face when trying to protect their rights, which this Bill seeks to address.",
            "First, rights holders can request network service providers to disable access to, or remove copyright infringing material from, its network. This is done by issuing a \"take-down\" notice to the network service provider. However, it is not a statutory requirement to comply with this take-down notice. Hence, it is not mandatory for network service providers to comply. In many cases, network service providers may contend that the take-down notice regime does not apply to them. For example, they may not have hosted the infringing material on their networks but functioned merely as conduits for the transmission of copyright infringing material.",
            "Under the current regime, rights holders can bring a legal action against network service providers for copyright infringement but, in order to succeed in removing the copyright infringing material, where the claim is disputed by the network service provider, it is necessary to establish the liability on the part of the network service provider for copyright infringement. This creates considerable uncertainty for rights holders, and both parties can incur considerable legal costs as well as time in such suits. In addition, the Copyright Act does not expressly provide for the conditions under which access to copyright infringing websites may be disabled and this adds to the uncertainty.",
            "In 2012, the Government appointed a Media Convergence Review Panel (MCRP) to study issues impacting consumers, industry and society in the converged media environment and to make recommendations on how to address these challenges.",
            "On the issue of online piracy, the MCRP recommended a multi-pronged approach, comprising public education, promotion of legitimate content services and adoption of appropriate regulatory measures.",
            "Among the various regulatory measures that could be adopted, the MCRP deemed site-blocking to be the most feasible measure to combat digital piracy. The Government has accepted the MCRP's recommendations concerning online piracy. The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) drives continuing public education efforts. It has been reaching out to the public to raise awareness about IP creation and protection through the Honour Intellectual Property (HIP) Alliance programme and other platforms.",
            "Second, rights holders are also working to increase the availability of legitimate digital content in Singapore, so that consumers are able to access such content conveniently and at reasonable prices.",
            "The Bill focuses on the third aspect – regulatory measures – and introduces a new regulatory measure to complement the other efforts. It amends the Act to institute a judicial site-blocking avenue. This will allow rights holders to apply directly to the Court for an order directing network service providers to block access to flagrantly infringing websites, without having to first establish liability on the part of the network service provider for copyright infringement. Instead, it is aimed at pirated content. The new framework is thus a \"no-fault\" regime vis-a-vis the network service providers",
            "The new measure is targeted at entire websites. Rights holders who wish to disable access to, or remove, specific parts of a website, for example, specific infringing content or specific web pages, can continue to rely on existing mechanisms in the Act, such as the notice and take-down system described earlier. This framework was derived after extensive consultations with industry stakeholders.",
            "While we sought to allow rights holders to more effectively protect themselves against pirate websites, we were also cognisant that the proposed framework should not unduly impinge upon the rights and interests of other stakeholders, including network service providers and website owners, hosting legitimate content.",
            "The proposed judicial measure balances the rights of the different stakeholders involved.",
            "First, rights holders will be able to obtain blocking orders relatively quickly and with greater certainty.",
            "Second, the interests of network service providers and online location owners will be safeguarded in three ways:",
            "(a) by prescribing statutory thresholds which ensure that only flagrantly infringing websites are caught;",
            "(b) by instituting robust procedural safeguards. This includes notice and service requirements, as well as appeals and reinstatement avenues; and",
            "(c) by the Court acting as the ultimate gate-keeper.",
            "While these measures are not exhaustive, adoption will signal our commitment against online piracy and firmly convey that Singapore does not condone copyright infringement. Stakeholders whom we consulted have generally expressed their strong support for the proposed site-blocking framework, as has the Media Literacy Council.",
            "I will now take the House through the main features of this new framework.",
            "The new framework allows rights holders to obtain blocking orders against what the Bill terms as a \"flagrantly infringing online location\". The Bill keeps the definition of \"flagrantly infringing online location\" technically neutral. This is to accommodate rapid technological advances over time.",
            "The Bill also prescribes a non-exhaustive list of factors to assist the Courts in determining whether an online location is flagrantly infringing. The intention, therefore, is to catch websites which are in blatant breach of copyright. On the other hand, sites that offer primarily legitimate digital content, legitimate business services, such as cloud storage services, search engines such as Google, or social media sites such as Facebook, that do not satisfy the factors will not be affected by the proposed schematic.",
            "The proposed measure will, therefore, not hinder access to and the exchange of legitimate content. Artistes can continue to distribute and share their content via legitimate websites.",
            "The procedure governing the application and grant of blocking orders has been carefully calibrated so as to balance the rights of rights holders, online location owners and network service providers.",
            "First, the Act requires rights holders to notify network service providers of their intention to apply for a blocking order. This allows network service providers the opportunity to resolve the matter out of Court. The application for a blocking order must be served on the network service provider. This ensures that the network service provider has the opportunity to present its case before the Court as to why an order should not be made. This could cover a variety of matters, including the technical feasibility of effecting the blocking order, the burden that the order may place on the network service provider and any adverse effect an order may have on the network service provider's business or operations.",
            "Second, website owners must also be notified of the application so that they, too, have the opportunity to present their case before the Court.",
            "In this regard, however, we are cognisant of the challenges posed by anonymity in cyber space, especially where the notice requirement to owners of online locations is concerned. As such, the Bill allows the Court to dispense with the relevant notices to the website owner where the Court is satisfied that reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain the identity or address of the website owner and send the notices to the website owner.",
            "The Bill also grants website owners a right to be heard during the blocking order application, as well as the same right of appeal as a party to the application.",
            "Third, the Bill provides for an avenue by which a party to the blocking order, as well as the website owner, can apply to Court to vary or revoke the order. For instance, website owners may apply to revoke the order if the site's content has been modified and the website has ceased to be a \"flagrantly infringing online location\". Rights holders may apply to vary the order if the web address of the website has been changed, such that the blocking is circumvented.",
            "Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, this Bill allows us to fulfil our obligations under the Marrakesh Treaty and reaffirms our unwavering commitment to respecting intellectual property. Sir, I beg to move."

            ": There are many collaboration programmes in our local Universities where students attend overseas attachments with partner universities. These include voluntary student exchange programmes and overseas work attachments. Typically, overseas programmes are compulsory for joint degree, dual masters and integrated degree and masters programmes where students are awarded jointly-validated qualifications from a local and foreign university.",
            "Our Universities have the autonomy to work with overseas partners on the structure and content of overseas programmes. These overseas components generally complement, rather than duplicate, the content covered locally, tapping on the relative strengths and niche areas of both our universities and foreign partners. For example, National University of Singapore (NUS) offers a joint degree programme in a Bachelor of Science in Life Sciences in collaboration with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). Students in this programme have the opportunity to complement their learning of life sciences in NUS with a liberal arts education at UNC-CH.",
            "There will be instances where the academic content covered in overseas programmes could conceivably have been covered locally. For instance, the Renaissance Engineering Programme (REP) offered in Nanyang Technological University is a dual-degree programme which awards students a Bachelor of Engineering Science coupled with a Master of Science in Technology Management. As part of the programme, students are given the opportunity to attend a one-year immersion in their third year at the University of California, Berkeley or Imperial College of London, to pursue an engineering specialisation and courses on technology-related entrepreneurship. While some of the academic content in that third year could possibly be covered locally, the overseas component allows students to learn in a different environment.",
            "The educational value of overseas programmes is more than just about their academic content. Overseas stints help develop cross-cultural awareness, independence and other soft skills in our students. Many students return with a stronger appreciation for and sense of responsibility to our society."

Assoc Prof Tan also asked whether the Charter has enabled ASEAN to recalibrate its norms, values and purpose to remain nimble, relevant and effective in various spheres of multilateral endeavours. I would first like to clarify for Assoc Prof Tan that there is currently no on-going review of the ASEAN Charter. The ASEAN Charter came into force on 15 December 2008. It conferred legal personality onto ASEAN as an inter-governmental institution. It codified ASEAN’s norms, values and purpose; set clear targets for ASEAN; and provided a framework for accountability and compliance for ASEAN member states. These include decision-making on the basis of consultation and consensus; maintaining ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture; reliance on the peaceful settlement of disputes; and shared commitment and collective responsibility in enhancing regional peace, security and prosperity.",
            "The impetus behind the ASEAN Charter was to serve as a framework to guide ASEAN's regional integration process, strengthen the existing ASEAN institutions and improve ASEAN's decision-making mechanisms. The ASEAN Charter outlines an approach for ASEAN to work towards the realisation of an ASEAN Community by 2015. It aims to improve ASEAN’s decision-making mechanisms by establishing a system of reporting lines and procedures. The Charter also lays out principles on ASEAN's engagements with external parties.",
            "The ASEAN Charter has been in force for five years. As ASEAN develops its Post-2015 Vision, it is vital that the ASEAN Charter continues to be relevant. For instance, while rules and processes are helpful in ASEAN’s integration, we must ensure that they do not proliferate, become obsolete and hamper ASEAN's effectiveness. The High Level Task Force (HLTF) on Strengthening the ASEAN Secretariat and Reviewing the ASEAN Organs is an example of an initiative that ASEAN member states have embarked on aimed at making ASEAN more well-equipped and nimble to respond to the challenges of our evolving regional architecture. Its work would include looking into ways to improve ASEAN’s institutions and processes, as well as reviewing ASEAN's conduct of external relations. The HLTF will submit its recommendations to the 15th meeting of the ASEAN Coordinating Council in November 2014."

Property markets tend to move in cycles, and several of these markets have already seen significant run-up in prices. Financial advisors also advise that investing in a diversified portfolio of assets, such as bonds and equities, in addition to the property they already own, is generally a more prudent way to seek good returns, and at lower risk than concentrating investments in properties.",

Based on its inspections of the nuclear power plant in Fukushima conducted in 2013, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is of the view that the food supply chain in Japan is safely under control.",

Over the same period, 526 and 426 persons aged 30 to 49 years underwent hip and knee replacement surgeries respectively at public hospitals.",
            "Common bone and cartilage conditions requiring joint replacement surgeries are hip fractures and osteoarthritis of the hip and knee joints. Fractures of hip joints are more common in the elderly and post-menopausal women due to thinning of bone structures (osteoporosis). Elderly patients are also at a higher risk of suffering fractures from falls. Osteoarthritis is more commonly observed in persons who are of advanced age, are overweight and/or have had previous joint injuries.",

For example, \"Lose to Win\" is a structured programme to lose weight and to prevent obesity; STEP (Strength Training Exercise Programme), aims to prevent falls by improving the physical function of older adults; and OPTIMAL (Osteoporosis Patient Targeted and Integrated Management for Active Living Programme) to encourage our elderly to lead an active lifestyle.",

This pilot has since been extended to include six acute hospitals and four community hospitals.",

Over 60% of the patients are able to receive the service on the actual day of discharge or the very next day while over 80% do so within three days. Nevertheless, some 60 patients considered the service but had turned down the service due to a number of reasons, such as families deciding to take care of the patients themselves and the families' ability to put in place care arrangements earlier than expected.",
