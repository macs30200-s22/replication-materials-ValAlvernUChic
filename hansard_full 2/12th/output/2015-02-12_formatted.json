            ": Mdm Speaker, both issues raised by Mr Gan were suggested as possible ways to ease COE prices in 2013 and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) had consulted extensively on them. Views on banning dealers from bidding for COEs were mixed.",
            "Some felt that dealers provided a convenient service when bidding on buyers' behalf. This approach also allowed the cost of the COE to be financed together with the vehicle cost in a loan package. Others noted that banning dealers from bidding would not lower the price of COEs as the dealers' bids were ultimately a reflection of the underlying demand and buyers' willingness to pay. Some also pointed out that a ban on dealers bidding could be easily circumvented, for instance, by the buyer providing personal details to the dealer to bid in his name.",
            "On the other hand, arguably, having a wider pool of bidders can make the auction and price discovery process more robust. On balance, the LTA decided to maintain the current system which gives vehicle buyers the flexibility to bid for themselves or have dealers bid on their behalf.",
            "The Pay-As-You-Bid model was also consulted on. It should be noted that, empirically, 80%-90% of the successful COE bids are typically clustered within 5%-10% of the final COE price. This suggests that the current bidding model is fairly robust, with not many extreme bids. In fact, experts in auction theory agree that the current system, which prices all COEs within a category uniformly, incentivises bidders to bid their true valuation. It also levels the playing field between the well informed and the less informed participants, and it is the most efficient allocation mechanism.",
            "In contrast, under a Pay-As-You-Bid system, bidders are likely to have to spend more time and transactional costs monitoring the bidding and adjusting their bids incrementally.",
            "That said, whatever the debate on the merits and demerits of different auction models, we should acknowledge the fact that COE prices are fundamentally dependent on demand and supply."

            ":Mdm Speaker, there are existing regulations for unmanned aircraft operations under the Singapore Air Navigation Order. Unmanned aircraft weighing more than seven kilograms without its fuel are subject to the same strict regulations and controls as manned aircraft, such as registration, airworthiness and flight operations requirements. For unmanned aircraft weighing seven kilograms or less, a permit from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) is required if the aircraft operates within five kilometres of an aerodrome, or at an altitude higher than 200 feet above mean sea level when outside five kilometres of an aerodrome. All operators of unmanned aircraft, regardless of whether a permit is required under current regulations for operating such an aircraft, are responsible for operating their unmanned aircraft with the safety and security of others in mind.",
            "My Ministry and CAAS, together with other Government Ministries and agencies, have started a review of the regulatory framework. The review will address how we can facilitate the increasing usage of unmanned aircraft, while managing the associated safety and security concerns. We are assessing the feasibility of differentiated levels of oversight for different uses. We are also studying if there is a need to register unmanned aircraft systems and specifying where such systems can or cannot operate. We will be consulting the relevant stakeholders in the coming months.",
            "On the concern over security and privacy, incidents where a person is found prying into another person's property using an unmanned aircraft, will be assessed on a case by case basis, taking into consideration the context and circumstances. As a general principle, enforcement action will be taken against the person carrying out activities which constitute an offence under existing laws such as the Penal Code.",
            "With regard to the operation of unmanned aircraft across international boundaries, there are international rules which prohibit such movements, unless authorisation has been issued by the States in which the flight is to operate. Prior coordination with the appropriate air traffic services authority is also required for operation over the high seas. In Singapore, contravention of these rules may lead to a fine not exceeding $100,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years."

First, how many of these permits have been issued, for those who operate unmanned aircraft of less than seven kilograms? Secondly, how long will this study be, and when will the study be concluded so that we roughly know the timeline as given by the Ministry, since the Ministry is reviewing the rules? I am also a bit concerned about mass events such as marathons and even our National Day Parade where thereby we see drones flying around. How do we know these are authorised drones or not? Will they pose a security threat to all of us?"

First, to share what the number of applications was: just in the month of January 2015 alone, there were 70 applications. This is a six-fold increase over the average of 12 applications per month a year ago in 2014. How many of those applications were approved and permits granted: between 60%-70% were approved, and just 20%-30% were not approved.",
            "The second question was about the review period. This is a multi-agency effort and as we are doing a review, we are also taking a closer look at countries such as the US and Australia who are similarly looking into their regulatory framework. There are obviously lessons to be learnt, and also experiences to be shared. The consultation with the relevant stakeholders is going to take place in the next few months. We will have to look at how extensive the regulations are going to be and then, we will be able to say with firmer sense, the timeline required. In relation to Dr Lim's interest, I think we can keep him posted on the progress."

One, I am not sure if more SACs in the pipeline will be delayed; so, what measures are there for HDB to have a prompt handover to MSF, so that the senior residents' social needs and safety will not be compromised due to such delays?

The operations are such that HDB builds the SACs, hands over to MSF, MSF works with the operators for a prompt delivery of the SACs, following internal renovations and installing of all the other equipment. For these three, they had some challenges with regards to their manpower. But I think they will engage the Advisors on the ground to try and expeditiously provide their services and facilities, and to make sure that the SACs are functional.",

MSF works very closely with the appointed operator or appointed VWO to encourage them to do the outreach to the residents. We appreciate the issue of confidentiality. We can work with MSF on Mr Baey's suggestion on whether HDB can protect the confidentiality and write to the residents to facilitate their understanding of such services that are available.

As the Member mentioned earlier, the quota is such that we reserve about 30% of the 2-room flats for singles, because we also need to meet the needs and demands of our first-time families as well as second-timers who require smaller flats. But our experience is such that where there are leftovers from the families and second-timers, these leftover 2-room flats will then be allocated to the singles.

Even if the quota today stays at 30%, the actual numbers that were taken up or allocated to singles are much higher. We will continue to monitor the situation.

Even before WorkPro was implemented, actually since 2004, we have been encouraging employers to implement progressive workplace practices. Under the previous schemes, ADVANTAGE! Scheme, WoW! Fund, as well as Flexi Works!, we have reached out to more than 3,700 companies which have benefited from these schemes, and the majority of them are SMEs.",

            "We do not have a target number for the number of companies that will come on-board. What we do is to work with our programme partners to reach out widely to as many companies as possible, and that is why we have about three to four outreach and briefing sessions every month, work with the SPRING's SME centres, as well as work through mass media platform. The idea is to reach out to as many companies as possible to get them on-board.",

            "The take-up for Age Management Grant -- because there are three components -- is actually very encouraging. As I have noted, $28 million have already been committed. For Job Redesign, one of the reasons we have identified for the low take-up is because many companies, particularly, the SMEs, do not have the expertise to implement job and work process redesign. Therefore, we are encouraging them to send their employees for some of the courses conducted by WDA which will equip them with the knowledge to implement job and process redesign, as well as working to build up local capabilities to help these companies to implement job and process redesign. We will provide the details once these are ready.",
            "The other area we have identified, which is the WorkLife component, there have been feedback as to why some companies do not take it up. For instance, one of the feedback is that companies say they may not need to actually incur any expenses in implementing flexiwork, for instance, staggered hours. Therefore, if you go on a reimbursement model, it is not an incentive because they do not actually incur cost.",
            "We have revised WorkLife last year in July, streamlined the scheme requirements, in order to allow more companies to be eligible for the scheme. One of the things we have done, for instance, is under the Development Grant portion, we have allowed companies, once they have implemented flexiwork and then put it into a policy, they will be able to get the first $20,000, whilst the second $20,000 under the Development Grant will be on a reimbursement basis.",
            "We have also streamlined the documentation requirements. For instance, instead of requiring the companies to submit, say, three to six months' worth of a list of the names of employees who have regularly used this flexiwork arrangements, we now require them to only submit the most recent one month's list of employees who have actually taken up flexiwork arrangements. This has helped. Since we implemented these, the number of employers who have come on-board this scheme has significantly increased in the last two quarters of last year. I think that more will come on-board. We will proactively reach out and encourage companies to come on-board and utilise the schemes to implement age and family-friendly workplace practices.",
            "Whilst we are mindful and we do want to ensure that this Scheme is accessible to all companies, I think we also need to be mindful that we need to balance this outcome with good governance for the funds, because we are ultimately accountable. The companies must also show commitment, value the schemes, as well as take ownership of the schemes."

Secondly, will the Senior Minister of State specifically consider prohibiting tactics, such as those that we often hear from our residents, for example, contacting persons other than the debtor in an effort to recover debts such as harassing family members and relatives; exposing the debtor's indebtedness to other people in an effort to humiliate him, such as faxing demand letters to people's workplace; carrying out debt collection activities ---"

            ":Â Madam, I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. Actually, you can look at it at three levels. The first level is really where debt collectors engage in criminal conduct. This steps clearly across the line. So, for example, you could have people causing hurt or behaving in an intimidating or threatening manner. That is criminal, and it falls within the area of criminal sanctions and penalties. And for those, there is a clear legislative regime to work towards that.",
            "The examples that the Member cited actually fall into another category. I think what the Member is saying is that there are some types of conduct which are not clearly criminal offences but are, nevertheless, harassing in any event. This is where the Protection from Harassment Act comes in, because that came into force only very recently. Prior to that, a large amount of this type of conduct really did not have much redress. But now that you have the Protection from Harassment Act, there are actually two options under the Protection from Harassment Act. There are some acts which will, again, fall into a criminal category, and then there are some, like faxing letters, turning up at the workplace, which may not necessarily be criminal but they do cause alarm, distress and harassment in any event, in which case there are civil remedies and the borrower can actually go to the State Courts and file a complaint.",
            "Then I think there is one more category which the Member is urging us to look at, which is that apart from these sanctions, can we consider guidelines or an indication to the industry of what are the appropriate practices to follow? That is something which currently falls within the purview of the Advisory Committee on Moneylending. The report is expected, as I indicated earlier, in the first quarter of 2015. So I think what the Ministry of Law would like to do is to wait for the report, then we will review it and see if there are steps that should be taken in this regard."

There have been some fairly prominent national infrastructure projects that have been stalled because the contractors may have gone bust. And some industry observers have called these \"suicide\" bids. So, is there any observation about the correlation between project failures or substantial delays due to low or unrealistic bids? Second, I would like to ask about the weightage that is allocated to productivity factored into the consideration for tender awards. The Senior Minister of State said that there are some considerations in terms of productivity. Generally, how much would this be factored in, like a certain percentage of the weightage, and how does it vary from project to project? And lastly, I would like to ask if the Ministry provides some sort of incentives for contractors to employ higher productivity methods for the public sector projects."

For instance, LTA awarded in the last 10 years more than a thousand projects, but there were only three that stalled.",
            "In terms of productivity weightage, under our Price Quality Method (PQM), it ranges from 80-20 to 60-40. So, in the straightforward projects where it is only construction, when the design is given, the weightage for quality and productivity is about 20%. In a design and build project, there is a lot more complication, then the quality weightage is higher at 40%.",

            "Mdm Speaker, allow me to explain to the House what happened in both incidents. The first service disruption occurred on 16 October 2013. New software was being installed onto one of M1's core network elements, called the Radio Network Controller (RNC). Upon installation, M1 observed abnormalities in the network and immediately started investigations. After carrying out initial diagnostics with its vendors, M1 could not identify the cause. Hence, M1 decided to uninstall the new software in the RNC and to \"roll-back\" to the original version. This step is a common industry practice when trying to isolate a problem that could arise from new software installation. The \"roll-back\" was done about two hours from the time of the disruption. However, I understand that the problem persisted and so, logically, M1 started to troubleshoot the other network components associated with the RNC. M1 subsequently established that there was a software bug in the Media Gateway and the disruption was subsequently resolved within an hour thereafter.",
            "IDA assessed that the preventive measures undertaken by M1 for this incident were reasonable. Firstly, M1 had carried out thorough testing of the software, including interoperability and compatibility, prior to the installation. Secondly, M1 successfully attempted the same software upgrade on another RNC in September 2013. Thirdly, the test cases adopted by M1 were extensive and comprehensive as M1 combined different test scenarios into each test case. This assessment was corroborated by IDA's third-party external consultant, whose advice IDA had sought for this case. Mdm Speaker, on service restoration which I elaborated upon earlier, IDA also assessed that there was no undue delay by M1 in troubleshooting, isolating and restoring services.",
            "For the 4 February 2014 incident, investigations started as soon as M1 received feedback from some subscribers that they were unable to make calls and send messages. M1 found a software bug which caused the mobile site switches to perform in an unstable manner. This, in turn, led to congestion at the various network layers. As this incident was not triggered by any network changes or recent software installation, roll-back was not necessary. To rectify the situation, M1 re-initialised the switches as well as other critical network elements, and services were fully restored thereafter.",
            "In its assessment, IDA also found that there was \"no undue delay\" in service restoration during the 4 February 2014 incident. M1 promptly activated its vendors upon discovery of the incident. Given that neither M1 nor its vendor encountered similar issues previously, there was no workaround solution readily available. This meant that M1 needed time to locate the cause of the incident, before deciding on the correct restoration action. It should also be noted that until the disruption on 4 February 2014, the same set of mobile site switches were deployed in many overseas operators' networks, and were also deployed in M1's network for several years without incident.",
            "Madam, both my Ministry and IDA fully appreciate the critical nature of mobile services and the importance that people place on these services for their everyday communication. This is why I have asked IDA to continue to ensure that our telco networks function optimally. I would like to assure the House that we remain committed to strengthen the resiliency of these networks, together with the operators. We expect operators to make sound technical decisions when designing and operating their networks. At the same time, we do not assess their culpability with perfect 100% hindsight. That would not be fair. Instead, we look at whether the decisions taken at the time were reasonable, based on the information available then to the decision-makers.",
            "While no network service is immune to failure, telcos can definitely improve the way they update and assist their customers when disruptions occur. We should expect better service, and I have told IDA that M1's public communications during the incidents should have been better managed. Operators must provide early and timely updates to its customers when outages occur."

            "For example, to better align productivity efforts in the construction sector, the Building Innovation Panel led by MND and BCA brings together nine regulatory agencies, including NEA, SCDF and LTA, to facilitate multi-agency evaluation and approval of innovative products or processes that improve construction productivity. The Panel has made it easier for several new technologies to be accepted for use in building projects in Singapore, such as Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction and Cross Laminated Timber. The use of new technologies and materials support the broader measures taken upstream, namely the higher requirements for development projects' buildability and constructability scores which are themselves the result of multi-agency deliberations. That is a sectoral example.",
            "More broadly, we have also established tripartite and inter-agency platforms to coordinate and drive national efforts across different domains. This approach has been adopted for the long-term effort to restructure our economy towards higher skills and productivity, through the tripartite National Productivity Council (NPC). The NPC is supplemented by sub-committees with sectoral focus.",
            "The multi-agency e-Gov Council is another case. It drives and coordinates the improvement of electronic services to businesses and citizens. A recent example is the processing of applications by property developers to pay an additional charge to enhance land value. By streamlining workflows and using a common IT platform, URA and SLA are able to process applications concurrently, reducing approval time.",
            "The Pro-Enterprise Panel (PEP) is another mechanism to address rules and regulations that hamper productivity. Businesses that face challenges navigating regulatory requirements may approach the PEP, which comprises senior public officers and business leaders. Since 2000, the PEP has reviewed more than 1,800 suggestions from businesses on rules and procedures and accepted more than half of them. Besides the PEP, there is a Smart Regulation Committee, which was set up to promote good regulatory design and practices across the Government, and to benchmark our regulations against international standards.",
            "Madam, our systems and processes will continue to evolve. But we are committed to strengthening the coordination of policies and processes within the Government and with our partners, and welcome suggestions on how we can do this better."

            ":Â Madam, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his reply. We know that our teachers already have very heavy academic workload and it is difficult to match teachers' interests to the sports they cover. Some schools have cited the lack of resources for scrapping certain sports CCAs and one of the resource constraints is finding a teacher to be in charge of the sport, and that is why I have suggested doing away with that requirement.",
            "For all intents and purposes, the teacher is there for safety but when the school has already outsourced the coaching of the sport, let us say, badminton, to a professional service provider, with a proper agreement, which includes having the professional provider take care of safety, can we not just leave it to the professional provider to be responsible for safety and free the teacher up to do other academic duties?"

Well, CCA is an integral part of education and we would like our students to learn not just to play the game. We want them to develop the right values, the ability to communicate and share wins and losses collectively. This is part of education. We would like teachers to be directly involved, apart from supervising or ensuring the safety of the students during CCA, in particular, games.",
            "During training, it is important for teachers to be there, they may not be good at a game and may not be able to teach the students on how to play the games, but they would be there to supervise and build the team spirit.",
            "In some cases, the presence of teachers becomes even more critical. Where there are competitions, teachers may be adjudicators. They will have to mediate between the different stakeholders: organisers, parents, coaches and so on. So, it is therefore important, for teachers to be there to supervise the training as well as during compeitions as prt of the holistic education for our students."

            ":Â Madam, there are various Government schemes to support our companies' innovation journey. SPRING offers the Innovation and Capability Voucher scheme (ICV) which provides support to SMEs for consultancy services and the implementation of integrated productivity solutions. Since 2012, SPRING has awarded around $65 million to our SMEs through 13,000 ICVs.",
            "Another example is A*STAR's Technology Adoption Programme (TAP), which was launched in July 2013. Under TAP, teams of advisors link SMEs with providers of technological solutions, or work with public research institutions to develop innovative solutions for adoption. So far, A*STAR has engaged more than 6,000 companies, and more than 1,200 companies have implemented technology solutions under the support of TAP.",
            "For companies that are pursuing more advanced innovation projects, assistance is also available from SPRING's Capability Development Grant (CDG), which co-funds up to 70% of qualifying costs. This grant covers a broad range of productivity improvement areas such as enhancements to workflow processes and technology innovations. In 2014, SPRING assisted more than 1,000 companies under CDG, and provided over $100 million in funding support.",
            "In addition, the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme provides tax deductions and cash payouts to help defray the cost of a broad range of investments along the innovation value chain, from simple purchases of IT and automation equipment to more complex R&D projects to acquire new knowledge and create novel products. In the Year of Assessment 2014, 54,000 companies made PIC claims.",
            "To develop Singapore's innovation capabilities, SPRING set up seven Centres of Innovation (COIs) in our public research institutes and polytechnics. These cover specific industry sectors, in Electronics, Environment and Water Technology, Marine and Offshore Technology, Food Innovation, Supply Chain Management, Precision Engineering, and Materials. The COIs provide technical consultation and facilities to support our companies in developing and prototyping innovative products.",
            "The results from these efforts have been encouraging. In the 2014 SME Development Survey conducted by the DP Information Group, 75% of the SMEs reported that they were planning to implement innovation in their companies. R&D investments by local SMEs have also increased. In 2012, local SMEs spent nearly $550 million on R&D activities. This is a 70% increase in R&D expenditure compared to 10 years ago, when local SMEs spent around $320 million."

First, given the progress we are making in R&D, what is the R&D spend in Singapore as a percentage of GDP? Is there a target that our country aspires to? Second, based on the feedback on the ground from SMEs, they find that the hurdle to qualify for R&D support is quite high. Usually, they think it requires breakthrough technology or major breakthroughs, and their R&D is mainly on a more incremental basis. So, I would like to ask whether there is scope for R&D to be defined in a broader sense so that more companies can qualify and focus on the innovative part of the productivity journey."

            ":Â Madam, I thank the Member for the questions. First, on R&D spending: if Members recall, our R&D spend through the national initiatives is around $16 billion over a five-year period. That was in the last cycle, which is from 2011 to 2015. That would average out to about $3 billion or so a year, which in very broad terms, is about 1% of GDP. This is public R&D funding. The target is to try and attract at least $1-$2 of matching private sector R&D to that. That gives you a sense of the broad scope, and that would more or less be in line with what is achieved in different countries, but there are variations according to the nature of their economy and the capacity of their private sector.",
            "For the second point on R&D, I think the Member's point is SMEs may be deterred because they think R&D means going for major breakthrough technologies as opposed to more incremental solutions, which might be relevant to their operations. That is a very good point. That is indeed why, in the range of measures that we have talked about, it is not just about going for major R&D ventures to achieve the kind of breakthroughs the Member referred to, but also for companies to be able to adopt simple technologies to their operations. For example, A*STAR works on creating a bunch of turnkey solutions which are plug-and-play. For example in the area of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging, where this can help in supply chain management, warehouse stock-taking and so on. For many companies, this is a simple plug-and-play solution. With the RFID tags coming down, this is something that the companies can adopt with a relatively small investment.",
            "We look at the whole range, and the idea is to allow companies to come in and to make it as easy as possible for our SMEs to come and adopt technology for precisely the reason that the Member mentioned, which is that technology can be used at any stage of development of a company."

Splitting Category D further would result in a much smaller quota available in each sub-category. This may lead to more volatility in quota and prices.",

HDB monitors that quite closely. We also require the help of local grassroots to let us know, should the tenancy breaches the agreement set out by HDB. It is a two-pronged approach: HDB will continue to do their spot checks from time to time to ensure that these flats are not sublet, not according to prescription.

            "Let me explain why we need to enact this Bill. This Bill will allow Singapore companies to enter the deep seabed mining industry. This is an emerging industry. We can leverage on our strengths and experience in the offshore oil and gas, the marine engineering as well as our trading sectors to capitalise on the growing opportunities in deep seabed mining.",
            "Introducing this Bill will bring us in line with the provisions under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the International Seabed Authority (ISA) regulations. The proposed licensing regime will ensure that our companies undertake deep seabed exploration and extraction activities in a responsible manner, and not cause damage to the marine environment. Penalties will be put in place to serve as deterrence against potential violations or, in the event of non-compliance, to hold errant companies accountable for their actions.",
            "Under the UNCLOS, the Government bears a \"due diligence\" obligation to ensure that a company sponsored by Singapore carries out its activities in a manner which conforms with relevant provisions of the UNCLOS, ISA regulations, and its exploration contract with the ISA. This obligation will be met by Singapore enacting this Bill to secure the sponsored company's compliance. In doing so, the Government will also be protected from any liability arising from environmental or non-environmental damage caused by any failure of a sponsored company to comply with its obligations.",
            "The deep seabed licensing regime is established under Part II of the Bill, consisting of clauses 4 to 17.",
            "Let me highlight some of the key elements. It will be an offence for a Singapore company to engage in deep seabed mining without a licence issued by the Minister and a contract with the ISA. Offenders may be fined up to S$300,000 for an initial offence, and they may be subject to a further fine not exceeding S$50,000 daily for a continuing offence, capped at S$500,000. As an added deterrent, individuals â including company directors who are complicit in the offence â may also be imprisoned for up to three months.",

            "Second, recently, the Secretary General of ISA mentioned about the preparation of an exploitation code for deep seabed polymetallic nodules mining, capacity building and environmental protection. Will Singapore undertake these regulations, when ready, into our legislation, in support of, and upon passing this Bill today?",
            "Third, how are contracts evaluated when they come through Singapore for an application? Do we have the relevant staff and expertise required for these evaluations, which should include geological, chemical and physical oceanographic information? Do we have trained personnel who are able to question and scrutinise these licence applications?",
            "Fourth, Madam, many such contracts, when approved, are long term and will last some, perhaps, 10 to 15 years or more. My question is: with such long duration, how will monitoring be carried out? And are these contractors required to submit regular reports, information and data? These data should not just be on the products or resources, but also on the environmental impacts. Will the annual reports of these companies also be made available to the licensing state?",
            "Fifth, the ISA does have training and capacity building in deep sea mining and research. Are there Singapore companies involved in this and do we send contractors for this training when they make an application?",
            "Sixth, pertaining to the certificate of sponsorship, with reference to Part I, clause 8, the phrase, I quote, \"The Minister may sponsor a licensee's application to the ISA for a corresponding ISA contract\", can I enquire what does the term \"sponsorship\" comprise: is it a letter of support, grant of a licence?",
            "And finally, Madam, on the Seabed Disputes Chamber, can I ask the Minister for clarification on its functions, jurisdiction and how it will work with the various states in the event a case arises where an intervention is required? I support the Bill, Madam."

            "First, she asked how many, if any, Singapore companies are currently involved in deep seabed mining. Madam, to date, as far as we know, only one Singapore-based company â Ocean Minerals Singapore (OMS) â has notified us about its intention to undertake deep seabed exploration. This company is a joint venture between Keppel and Lockheed Martin.",
            "Second question: the Member asked about the preparation of the exploitation code by ISA and whether we would undertake regulations to enforce this code. Singapore is participating in ISA's deliberations together with other ISA members in the development of the exploitation code. This Bill, when enacted, will enable the Government to introduce further regulations should the need arise, to comply with evolving international standards and regulation of deep seabed mining.",
            "Madam, the Member asked how would the contracts be evaluated and whether we have the capability to question and scrutinise these applications. Let me explain that the deep seabed mining consists of two limbs. Any company wanting to undertake deep seabed mining has to apply for a contract with the ISA and at the same time they need the country where the company is based to sponsor that application. So as far as the Singapore Ggovernment is concerned, we will evaluate applications from companies for sponsoring of the licence, from both the economic as well the environmental angles. And so, to qualify, a company must possess the technological and financial capabilities to undertake the activities they plan to do; and, secondly, demonstrate that it has planned its activities in a manner that complies with the relevant regulations in order to minimise any potential damage to the marine environment.",
            "To do so, we have set up an inter-agency taskforce comprising MTI, MEWR, MFA, MinLaw and AGC and this inter-agency taskforce has been formed to oversee such applications for licences and how we woul want to sponsor the companies. And where necessary, this taskforce will consult external experts in the maritime and marine environment fields, some of whom are engaged by the ISA.",
            "The next question is how would monitoring be carried out, because such contracts may last 10 to 15 years. As part of the ISA's regular monitoring mechanism, contractors are required to submit annual reports relating to the exploration activities that they have carried out in the deep seabed. Singapore will also require our licensed companies to file the reports with us on a regular basis and we will monitor our sponsored entities on this basis and will intervene if our companies are at risk of non-compliance.",
            "The next question that the Member raised is about the training and capacity building that ISA has and whether any Singapore companies are involved in this. Currently, we are not aware of any Singapore companies involved in ISA's training programmes and capacity building.",
            "On the certificate of sponsorship, the question is what this sponsorship comprises of. Basically, by issuing a certificate of sponsorship, the sponsoring government is declaring to the ISA that we accept the responsibility to ensure that our sponsored entity will carry out its activities in conformance with UNCLOS and the ISA regulations. And in tabling this Deep Seabed Mining Bill, we are, in fact, establishing a framework for carrying out this responsibility.",
            "And finally, the Member asked about the jurisdiction of a Seabed Disputes Chamber and how it will work with the various states. The Seabed Disputes Chamber has jurisdiction over activities in the deep seabed, and if the Seabed Disputes Chamber were to find a Singapore licensed company responsible in the dispute and orders compensation or reparation, then clauses 18 and 19 of our Bill will allow for such an order to be registered and thereafter treated as a judgment of our Court. And this will then allow Singapore to work with the ISA to enforce against any errant activities should the need arise.",

            "That this Parliament:",
            "(i) notes with concern the Auditor-General's Report on the Audit of Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC) (Paper Misc 1 of 2015), specifically its findings on:",
            "(a) the deficiencies in AHPETC's financial and accounting systems, record-keeping and safeguards;",
            "(b) the uncertain accuracy and reliability of AHPETC's accounts;",
            "(c) the lack of proper disclosure and oversight by AHPETC's Town Councillors, especially over related-party transactions and conflicts of interest; and",
            "(d) the risk that AHPETC has not properly managed and spent public funds;",
            "(ii) calls on all Town Councils to uphold high standards of accounting, reporting and corporate governance so as to safeguard residents' interests; and",
            "(iii) supports strengthening the legislative framework for Town Councils, in order to hold those responsible for their good management to proper account.",
            "A copy of the audit report has been circulated to Members as Paper Misc 1 of 2015. It was also released to the public on Monday, 9 February.",
            "This is the first time in the history of Town Councils (TCs) that the Auditor-General has undertaken a special audit on a Town Council to look into concerns about its financial circumstances, under section 4(4) of the Audit Act. Let me explain how this came about.",
            "Each year, Town Councils are required to submit their audited financial statements, auditor's report, and annual reports to my Ministry by 31 August, within five months of their financial year closure. MND will then table the reports to Parliament. All Town Councils have been able to meet the submission deadline, except AHPETC.",
            "AHPETC have not submitted their reports on time ever since their formation in 2011. Their first set of reports for Financial Year 2011 was only submitted to MND on 11 January 2013, a delay of more than four months, after repeated reminders. Even then, their Auditor's report was a qualified one, with the Auditor making a Disclaimer of Opinion on the financial statements. The Auditor listed four areas as the basis for their disclaimer. In audit terms, a Disclaimer of Opinion is a serious matter. It means that the auditors are unable to state that the financial statements provide a true and fair account of the Town Council's financial position.",
            "In response, AHPETC assured the MND that they had rectified most of the observations raised by their Auditor, and were in the midst of rectifying the others. That was in August 2013. MND decided to give the Town Council time to resolve their issues.",
            "Unfortunately, the following year saw no improvement. Their second set of reports for Financial Year 2012 was submitted to MND on 10 February 2014, after another long delay of six months. And once again, their independent Auditor, Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton, submitted a Disclaimer of Opinion on AHPETC's Financial Year 2012 financial statements.",
            "Not only was this the second consecutive year that the Town Council's independent Auditor had submitted a Disclaimer of Opinion on AHPETC's Financial Statements, but they now raised 13 areas as the basis for their disclaimer. There were nine new issues of pressing concern, in addition to four areas identified by the Auditor in the previous year, which remained unresolved contrary to AHPETC's assurance to MND. The Auditor also issued a qualified opinion on AHPETC's other legal and regulatory requirements, stating that AHPETC had not complied with the provisions of the Town Councils Act and Financial Rules in various respects. The Town Council's financial accounting had further deteriorated.",
            "This is a cause for serious concern. Town Councils collect substantial monthly Service & Conservancy Charges (S&CC) from their residents and their commercial tenants. Town Councils also receive large S&CC grants from MND. These are all public monies. As stewards of public funds, all Town Councils must keep proper accounts and records, and maintain adequate control over their assets. Who has paid and who has not? How is the money spent? Is it properly used? Is anybody doing anything wrong? Is the Town Council solvent, being able to pay its bills on time? Does the Town Council have enough reserves in its Sinking Fund to replace major infrastructure when it is needed? For example, can the Town Council afford to replace the lifts when it is time to do so?",
            "These and many other questions directly affect the interests and safety of the residents. They are not trivial technical issues raised merely to satisfy the accountants or the auditors, or to meet financial regulations. Unfortunately, the observations in AHPETC Auditor's Reports have raised serious questions about the reliability and accuracy of its financial and accounting systems.",
            "That is why on 19 February 2014, at my request, the Minister for Finance exercised his power under the Audit Act to direct the Auditor-General (AG) to conduct a special audit of AHPETC's accounts. This was not a routine audit. Auditor-General was to ascertain whether AHPETC had taken all reasonable steps to safeguard the collection and custody of AHPETC's monies, ensure adequate controls over payments, and ensure that all legal provisions relating to AHPETC's monies were fully complied with. Auditor-General was to investigate the causes of Foo Kon Tan's Disclaimer of Opinion, and ascertain the reliability and accuracy of AHPETC's financial management and accounting processes and systems.",
            "The AGO report has set out clearly its approach and its findings. It is a sad commentary on the state of affairs at the AHPETC. In summary, the Auditor-General's investigation has uncovered major lapses. It found that AHPETC had failed to take all reasonable steps to safeguard the collection and custody of AHPETC's monies, ensure adequate controls over payments, and fully comply with all legal provisions relating to AHPETC's monies. It concluded that the AHPETC had no proper accounting system resulting in the Town Council's financial statements failing to \"accurately reflect the state of affairs and transactions of AHPETC\". It added that \"there can be no assurance that AHPETC's accounts are accurate and reliable, or that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed\". In other words, AHPETC's financial and accounting processes and systems are unreliable and their accounts, inaccurate.",
            "Members can read the details in the Auditor-General's report. But let me just highlight four of AGO's key findings.",
            "The Auditor-General has found that:",
            "(a) AHPETC did not transfer monies to its Sinking Fund as required by law;",
            "(b) AHPETC had inadequate oversight of related party transactions involving ownership interests of key officers;",
            "(c) AHPETC had weak internal controls and systems to monitor payments received and made; and",
            "(d) AHPETC had no system to safeguard important documents or keep proper accounts as required under the law, and failed to provide key information required by its Auditor and the Auditor-General.",
            "As a result of these major lapses, the Auditor-General concluded that there was no assurance that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed by AHPETC.",
            "Let me quote relevant sections from the AGO report to elaborate on these findings.",
            "First, the Auditor-General found that, \"AHPETC had not complied with the Town Councils Financial Rules. It failed to make the required transfers to sinking fund bank accounts\".",
            "All Town Councils are required by law to transfer 30% to 35% of their S&CC collections and grants received to their own sinking funds. These monies are the Town Councils' own savings, for the Town Councils to replace major infrastructures like lifts and to do major repairs and repainting. The transfers have to be made promptly, to ensure that the monies are safeguarded.",
            "The Auditor-General found that more than a year after the end of each financial year, AHPETC still had not transferred the full sums required for their Sinking Fund. It owed $7.9 million for the Financial Year 2011 sinking fund, and $3.9 million for Financial Year 2012.",
            "In Financial Year 2012, AHPETC had $86 million in its sinking fund. Eighty-six million might seem like a lot of money. However, AHPETC has about 1,870 lifts which the Town Council needs to replace when their operating-life expires. In fact, over the next 10 years alone, it will need to replace 10% of the entire stock of lifts. This will cost $54 million, or 60% of the current sinking fund. So, that will leave only 40% of the current sinking fund for other major repairs and repainting works that also need to be done. Things can only get worse beyond that, because the bulk of the lift replacements â about 90% of the 1,870 lifts â are due after 2025. AHPETC needs to build up its Sinking Fund. If it continues to miss contributions to its sinking fund, the residents will eventually be living in blocks where lifts are unsafe or unreliable, and other infrastructures often break down.",
            "There is always the temptation, when a Town Council is financially strapped, to postpone saving, and say it will make up the shortfall later, or worse, to put its hand into the cookie jar, to draw from the savings to satisfy immediate needs. Just spend, use the savings first. Sounds appealing. But the Town Council will then be simply running down its reserves and mortgaging the future of its residents away. And that is why the Town Councils Act and Financial Rules enforce saving to pay for replacements and major repairs which have to be carried out in future.",
            "Second, the Auditor-General found that, \"AHPETC did not disclose fully the related party transactions in its financial statements. It also did not adequately manage the conflicts of interests of related parties arising from ownership interests of its key officers\".",
            "The related parties were two companies, FMSS and FMSI, engaged by AHPETC to carry out managing agent services and essential maintenance and lift rescue services. FMSI was a sole proprietorship owned by the Secretary of AHPETC. The directors and shareholders of the other company, FMSS, were the Secretary, General Manager and Deputy General Manager of AHPETC. The Secretary and General Manager of AHPETC are, by the way, husband and wife.",
            "The Auditor-General found that, \"The key officers of AHPETC, that is, Secretary, General Manager and Deputy General Manager, who had ownership interests in FMSS and, at the same time, performed a role for AHPETC in approving payments to FMSS were in clear conflicts of interests. Hence, it was important for AHPETC to have put in place adequate mitigating controls to manage the conflicts of interests\".",
            "However, AHPETC did not properly oversee transactions with these companies owned by its key officers. The Auditor-General found that before AHPETC entered into contracts with these companies, \"There was no documentary evidence that the AHPETC Town Councillors had specifically considered the ownership interests of AHPETC Secretary, General Manager and a Deputy General Manager. These contracts amounted to about $25.9 million in total\".",
            "The Auditor-General also found that, \"There were control weaknesses, and lack of documentary evidence that payments to the related parties were independently verified so as to ensure that work has been satisfactorily performed and payments were fully justified and correctly computed\". The report cites \"instances where the Secretary and General Manager issued payment claims as owner of FMSI and director of FMSS respectively, and subsequently, the same General Manager certified these payment claims and approved the payment vouchers in her capacity as an officer of AHPETC\". In other words, it is very convenient â the husband issued the payment voucher and the wife approved the payment and the wife also signed the cheque â it is all in the family.",
            "The Auditor-General concluded that, \"Taken in totality, AHPETC did not adequately manage the conflicts of interest involved in related party transactions\". This means that AHPETC may not have obtained the best value for the moneys paid to these related parties. Or worse, there could be opportunities of wrong-doing or unethical practices which AHPETC may not be able to detect or prevent.",
            "Compounding this risk, the Auditor-General found \"lapses in internal controls, which exposed AHPETC to the risk of loss of monies, or valuables, commitment to expenditure without requisite approval as well as wrong payments for goods and services\". The AGO report contained many examples of such lapses, including instances of a lack of segregation of duties within the payment process for many invoices to third-party vendors. For example, \"the General Manager of AHPETC certified work done as well as approved the payment vouchers and cheques\", to external vendors. This was in addition to the lapses in payment to the related parties owned by the key officers that I mentioned earlier.",
            "Now, Town Councils award millions of dollars of contracts each year. Residents and taxpayers need to know that their monies are properly spent and they are getting best value for money. When these contracts are awarded to parties related to the Town Council, the Town Council needs to be upfront with its residents as well as with taxpayers at large, so that there is transparency and proper scrutiny. In total, AHPETC has close to $27 million worth of contracts with its two related parties, FMSS and FMSI. Of these, close to $6 million was given without tender.",
            "Third, the Auditor-General observed that AHPETC did not have a system to monitor the scale of its S&CC arrears accurately. \"The statistics on arrears that AHPETC submitted to MND as well as AHPETC's Finance and Investment Committee were unreliable\". As a result, the Auditor-General concluded that \"There is no assurance that AHPETC is able to monitor and manage its S&CC arrears properly or present an accurate picture of arrears in its financial statements\".",
            "Each year, AHPETC collects about $37 million in S&CC from residents and tenants, and receives another $7 million in grants from Government. The Town Council also manages a reserve of about $90 million, accumulated from residents' monies and Government grants over the last 25 years. Without a proper accounting system, the Town Council cannot accurately ascertain how much of the arrears is recoverable. This means that the Town Council's financial position, as reported in its annual financial statement may, in fact, be overstated. If so, the Town Council may actually get into financial difficulties without realising it. There is also no assurance that Government grants, which are taxpayers' monies disbursed to the Town Council, are being safeguarded and channelled to the purpose for which they are given. And most fundamental of all, there is no safeguard against potential mischief and loss of public monies.",
            "Fourth, the Auditor-General reported that AHPETC had no proper system to safeguard important documents and had weak accounting procedures. It did not provide key information required by its Auditor and the Auditor-General. Without access to proper records, the Auditor-General, like the Town Council's own auditors, was unable to make a proper assessment of the Town Council's financial situation. As a result, the Auditor-General concluded that \"There can be no assurance that AHPETC's accounts are accurate and reliable\".",
            "Now, Madam, a key plank of Town Councils' accountability towards their residents is via their financial accounts, which have to be audited annually by an independent Auditor and tabled to Parliament. AHPETC's failure to provide information to its Auditor and the Auditor-General has completely undermined the system of accountability. While the Town Council framework is designed to give Town Councils maximum autonomy in their operations, it demands in turn that Town Councils account for their actions through proper accounting, governance and disclosure. AHPETC's repeated failure to do so shows a disregard for its obligation to account to its residents; and also disregard for this Parliament of which the AHPETC's Chairman, Vice-Chairmen and their fellow Members of Parliament have solemnly sworn to serve in.",
            "As the accounts are unreliable, we do not know the exact state of AHPETC's financial position. Based on their published reports, AHPETC's financial position has deteriorated sharply since Aljunied Town Council was merged with Hougang Town Council in 2011. The audited Financial Year 2010, financial stake accounts at Aljunied Town Councils, had reported an operating surplus of $3.3 million. By Financial Year 2012, the merged Town Council had incurred a $734,000 operating deficit.",
            "Now, a Town Council runs a surplus if its income exceeds expenditure for that year; conversely, it runs a deficit if its expenditure exceeds income. In Financial Year 2010, the Aljunied Town Council's expenditure was less than its income and, hence, the Town Council had a surplus. But in Financial Year 2012, AHPETC's expenditure had exceeded its income, resulting in a deficit. In two years, AHPETC's income rose 14% as its population base had increased, but its expenditure had shot up disproportionately by 30%.",
            "The deterioration of AHPETC's financial position was in part due to Aljunied absorbing Hougang and its bad finances. In Financial Year 2010, before merging with Aljunied, Hougang Town Council had an operating deficit of $92,000. It was also partly due to the abnormally large fees it paid to its Managing Agent, the FMSS, which was fully owned by the key officers of AHPETC.",
            "Mdm Speaker, the Auditor-General's findings confirm that something is seriously wrong at the AHPETC. They paint a picture of financial mismanagement, incompetence and negligence in corporate governance.",
            "If an auditor makes such a finding on a listed company, it will immediately cause consternation among the shareholders, and a call for the removal of the CEO and the Board of Directors. In Japan, the Chairman and CEO would hold a press conference and take a deep bow. And in the good old days, they may even commit",
            "harakiri.",
            "Where there are breaches of the Companies Act, both the company as well as the individuals responsible could be charged, and if found guilty, punished with fines and/or jail terms for the individuals.",
            "Even for charities, if their auditor makes such a damning finding, the Commissioner of Charities will haul up the Governing Board and key officers for a full inquiry. They will be suspended and eventually removed from their duties if the findings are borne out. They can also be charged and punished for any breaches of the Charities Act.",
            "Town Councils are not regulated under the Companies Act or the Charities Act. As I explained in this House in May 2013, Parliament decided in 1989 to give elected Members of Parliament more authority and responsibility over the HDB estates in their constituencies in order to strengthen the nexus between the residents and their elected Members. The strategic intent was to bring home to the Members that how they manage and run their Town Council will affect their electoral fortunes at the next election, and to voters that the Members of Parliament they elect will be responsible for looking after their housing estates. This would enhance accountability, push Members to focus on what mattered to the residents, and in turn, encourage voters to scrutinise more closely the capabilities and track record of election candidates. That is why the Town Councils Act deliberately takes a light touch approach to regulation and enforcement.",
            "However, light touch does not mean that the Members and the Councillors running the Town Council bear no responsibility and need not be held to account if the Town Council fails to perform. By law, the Members and Councillors are ultimately responsible for everything in the Town Council. They cannot simply delegate their responsibility away to their Managing Agent or any others.",
            "Unfortunately, throughout this saga, we have found the Members of Parliament running the AHPETC to be evasive, unresponsive and misleading. In response to legitimate queries from auditors, my MND officials, their own residents and the media, they stone-walled, deflected the queries, made false or dishonest claims, raised irrelevant excuses and sought to confuse the public with a flurry of red herrings.",
            "Let me give four illustrations. First, their lack of transparency â they failed to disclose things on time; they failed to submit reports they should be submitting. Every time we reminded them, again and again, they came up with yet another excuse.",
            "AHPETC's FY2011 and FY2012 financial statements were late, and its FY2013 statements are still outstanding. AHPETC's Service & Conservancy Charges (S&CC) arrears reports have been outstanding for nearly two years.",
            "Financial incompetence aside, failure to carry out critical cyclical maintenance work is an even graver safety concern. For instance, even AHPETC's FY2013 cyclical maintenance works report which informs MND of any delays in replacing major infrastructure, was late for more than six months, incomplete and inaccurate. This is serious as it potentially impacts on public health and safety. For instance, we expect lifts to be replaced after 28 years. If the Town Council prolongs the replacement of a lift beyond the recommended operating-life, we require them to disclose it, and declare that it remains in serviceable condition and has been duly certified by qualified personnel. But AHPETC does not seem to be exercised over such reporting. Each time MND officers update me on their Town Councils' submissions, it reads, \"AHPETC still outstanding\". Why this lack of transparency? Why are reports from AHPETC always outstanding?",
            "Second, the Town Council appointed a related party, FMSS, as its Managing Agent. As I explained earlier, the owners of FMSS are Mr Danny Loh, who became the Town Council's Secretary, and Ms How Weng Fan, Mr Loh's wife, who became the Town Council's General Manager. There were occasions where Ms How certified work done, approved the payment voucher and approved the cheque from the Town Council to her own company.",
            "The Auditor-General has found insufficient disclosure of the related party transactions in AHPETC's financial statements, and lack of evidence of safeguards to manage the conflicts of interests of related parties arising from the ownership interests of its key officers. Why did AHPETC not disclose these related party transactions and take steps to prevent the risk of abuse when the companies it gave contracts to were owned by its key officers?",
            "Third, FMSS was paid abnormally high fees. It was paid 20% more than the previous Managing Agent that ran Aljunied, 50% more than a comparable Town Council, and more than any other Town Council. Why? When asked, the Town Council explained publicly that the higher rates included services which used to be contracted out, such as IT administration and maintenance, resulting in savings for the Town Council. Sounds like fair enough. But is it true?",
            "In December 2012, in response to MND, the Town Council said, \"It had moved on to upscale and develop the Financial System which was in use at the former Hougang SMC\". So, it is not true. And what exactly is the capability of this \"up-scaled and developed Financial System\"? Apparently, it could not even track and make simple monthly arrears reports. To produce the reports, the Town Council told MND that they would require \"manual counting and sorting\".",
            "Fourth, their failure to deal expeditiously with problems â S&CC arrears being a prime example. Throughout this sad saga, what are the Members of Parliament of AHPETC doing? I do not expect them to take over the job of their Managing Agent, but I do expect them to exercise close supervision, and when problems arise or issues are highlighted, to step up, take responsibility, look into them quickly and address them squarely.",
            "This is the accountability that we expect of all elected Members of Parliament, or for that matter, any company director or any member of the governing board of a charity. Instead, what we have consistently gotten from the Members of Parliament of AHPETC is side-stepping and avoiding responsibility -- first \"no response\", then \"in due course\", and then followed by a series of excuses, blaming everybody else for their failure to perform.",
            "Finally, last month, AHPETC declared that they had \"embarked on a roadmap to enhance its aggregated arrears reporting module sometime in November 2014\". This is their response to a problem in June 2013, 17 months earlier! Simply astounding.",
            "Clearly, this state of affairs is unacceptable. MND will follow up in three ways.",
            "(a) AHPETC to remedy the problems: first, MND expects AHPETC to follow up and remedy the problems and weaknesses listed in the AGO Report. It is already too late for AHPETC to submit their FY2013 financial reports on time. But MND expects them to submit an unqualified set of their FY2013 financial reports to MND by 30 June 2015, and FY2014 financial reports by 31 Aug 2015. These must be tabled to Parliament, just like the financial reports from all the other Town Councils.",
            "MND further expects AHPETC to deal decisively with the gross incompetence of its Managing Agent. Please do something for the sake of your residents. There has been overpayment and public funds have been affected. Will the Town Council be suing the FMSS for return of money lost? Meanwhile, MND is studying what other legal recourse any aggrieved party may have.",
            "(b) MND to suspend the S&CC grants: second, because of these serious problems, MND has withheld this year FY2014 S&CC grant from the AHPETC. The money has been put aside in a separate deposit account, and will be paid out after the problems are fixed.",
            "MND is mindful that the suspension does not unwittingly result in the Town Council not being able to pay its essential services, leading to hardship for the local residents. In fact, we are prepared to consider paying out the S&CC grants, in full, or at least in half, if AHPETC could assure MND that the grants will be properly channelled to the purpose for which they are given.",
            "MND has asked AHPETC what measures they could institute to ensure this. AHPETC has not yet taken up MND's offer. On 12 November 2014, Ms Sylvia Lim replied MND to say that they are assessing the situation and will reply should they wish to take up the option of the half-grant. We are concerned, but we have not heard from her since then. Anyway, the earlier the AHPETC cleaned up the mess, the earlier we could resume payment of the S&CC grants. So, the ball is in the Town Council's court.",
            "(c) MND to Amend the Town Councils Act: third, MND will address the weaknesses in the current Town Councils regulatory framework. We can no longer take the light touch and assume that all Members of Parliament running Town Councils will be responsible. We will amend the Town Councils Act to ensure that the Town Councillors, including the elected Member of Parliament, carry out their duties and if they do not, to institute a proper system of enforcement and penalties.",
            "Regardless of which party is running the Town Council, there is a need to ensure proper systems, accountability and governance, to safeguard residents' interests. The Companies Act regulates companies closely. Boards of Directors are held to a high standard of fiduciary duties. The Town Councils Act has not and may not need to follow the Companies Act in full. But the basic need for accountability and good corporate governance must be followed and the legislative provisions strengthened as in the Companies Act.",
            "After the Committee of Supply this year, MND will table a Bill to amend the Town Councils Act to tighten the current legislative framework, so as to better protect the public interest. Senior Minister of State Lee Yi Shyan has been working on this and will take the Bill through Parliament. But let me set out briefly three key areas which the amended Act will address:",
            "(a) At the fundamental level, we will make clear that Town Councils are subordinate to and must comply with the authority of public law and of Government agencies charged with enforcing the law. While Town Councils are statutorily vested with the function and duty to manage and maintain common property, they do not own the common property and their powers are not unfettered.",
            "We have assumed that all Town Councils will follow this fundamental principle without needing to spell it out explicitly. But, sadly, AHPETC has proven us wrong. For example, we require all Town Councils to focus on their primary mission which is to maintain the common areas under their care. Town Councils are not set up like for-profit companies to make money. Town Councils should break-even with revenue from the S&CC collections and Government grants.",
            "For example, it is not their business to organise and operate trade fairs which compete with existing HDB shops as that would be unfair to the shops. That is why there are clear rules against such a practice. However, AHPETC has refused to comply with such rules, despite repeated reminders from MND and other Government agencies.",
            "(b) We will strengthen Town Councils' corporate governance and financial accountability, to ensure that Town Councils plan and use their finances in a sustainable way. This will take reference from best practices in companies and other organisations, and include spelling out the duties and responsibilities of the Town Councillors and elected Members of Parliament, and the penalties if they fail to perform those duties.",
            "(c) We will strengthen MND's regulatory oversight with powers to collect information and conduct investigations, and a stronger penalty framework. Currently, the Town Councils Act does not provide MND with any levers to cause Town Councils to comply, except for offence provisions in three narrow areas.",
            "MND also lacks the power to investigate irregularities or non-compliance with the Town Councils Act, as it does not have the expressed authority to require Town Councils to submit any information beyond the annual financial statements. So far, MND has been relying on moral suasion and Town Councils' self-declarations.",
            "For effective governance and regulatory oversight, MND requires powers to collect information and conduct investigations. This also has to be coupled with a stronger penalty framework, to enable the Government to take errant Town Councils to task for non-compliance.",
            "Mdm Speaker, how Town Councils perform matters. How our public housing estates are managed impacts public health, public safety, and the quality of life for millions of Singaporeans, and the value of their flats.",
            "Town Councils need competent, honest people and proper systems to serve their residents well. Good intentions and bland assurances alone are not sufficient. Elected Members of Parliament need to supervise the work of their Town Councils and their Managing Agents. While they enjoy wide autonomy, they also have huge responsibility, and they are accountable to their residents. They have statutory duties but they are also subject to national laws.",
            "Running a Town Council requires elected Members of Parliaments to govern, not just politick. Compared to the sound and fury of politicking, governing is long, tedious and unglamorous work. But good government is what secures a good life for Singaporeans, on a long-term, sustainable basis. Conversely, neglect of Government ultimately compromises residents' well-being. It may not show up immediately, but it will eventually. Meanwhile, where serious problems have been identified, MND has to intervene to require the Town Council to remedy them.",
            "Mdm Speaker, beyond ensuring that our HDB estates are well run, the Town Councils Act has a wider strategic objective: to ensure that any party aspiring to form the national government of Singapore first shows that it can run a Town Council competently. This aim remains sound. That is why despite the problems that the AHPETC has run into, we do not propose taking back the Town Council's powers and having HDB run everything again, like before. Instead, we will strengthen the Town Council framework to remedy the weaknesses in it, so that elected Members of Parliament have to perform and be held more tightly to account in running their Town Councils and towns.",
            "Madam, I do not relish making this statement. Parliament should be about accountability and responsibility. Sadly, the Auditor-General's report has found the lack of accountability and failure to take responsibility on the part of AHPETC Chairman and her Councillors. I hope they will act speedily to remedy the problems. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.",

            ":Â Â Mdm Speaker, the Workers' Party supports the motion. We treated the AGO audit seriously. I understand that the Town Council had made all efforts to respond to AGO's queries to the extent of the need to prioritise the audit over some other works due to manpower resources constraints.",
            "The Chairman of the Town Council, Sylvia Lim, attended to AGO audit personally. The staff employed by the Managing Agent working at the Town Council had undergone tremendous stress. They are overwhelmed by their workload amidst challenging conditions. I would like to thank them for putting in their best efforts.",
            "We take the findings of the AGO seriously and have responded to details of the findings in writing to AGO. The Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the Town Council as well as other Members of Parliament from the Workers' Party, elected Members, will deal with the various findings of the AGO report.",
            "I would like to first to address the public misconception that the Managing Agent was given the contract without tender. Open public tenders were called in 2012 for the Managing Agent (MA) and EMSU contracts. The most recent tender for the MA contract was called in November 2014. However, tender was not called for the MA contract for the specific transition period between July 2011 and July 2012 and for EMSU contract, the period between October 2011 and June 2012, due to the urgency to take over the management of the town and to ensure that major services were not disrupted to affect the lives of residents. The important point to note is that the Town Councils Act allows the Chairman of a Town Council to waive tender requirement under the circumstances.",
            "Mdm Speaker, the fact remains that it has been a challenge for the Workers' Party, being an Opposition Party to attract Managing Agents. When the public tender was called in 2012, three companies collected the tender documents, and only one company submitted the tender. In a more recent tender, only one company, the largest Managing Agent managing PAP Town Councils, collected the tender document but no one submitted any tender.",
            "What we learnt from this AGO audit is that we should have appointed a consultant to look at internal controls in compliance with the Town Councils Act while the elected Members of Parliament focused on taking over the management of the town to ensure that major services are not interrupted and residents' routine lives are not affected. This is something we will do if such a privilege should happen in future elections.",
            "But the problem of professional town management in compliance with financial rules will remain a real challenge if there are no established Managing Agents who are prepared to do the job. It will seem that Managing Agents serving PAP Town Councils are unwilling to serve as Managing Agents in non-PAP Town Councils, and that the reason appears to be political rather than professional. It looks like the only option for any Opposition Party to take over a Town Council will be direct management. I did this in Hougang SMC when I took over the Town Council in 1991. However, at that time, the HDB provided computer and EMSU services and the Town Council paid a fee per month for the services. The Council recruited staff directly to manage the town. Hougang SMC is a compact town.",
            "Currently, the only alternative Town Council financial accounting system was developed by Hougang SMC which had proven to be inadequate for a GRC town. Direct management means newly elected Members of Parliament will have to start from scratch to recruit and train staff to be familiar with HDB estate management, to start taking over management of the town within 90 days as required under the Town Councils Act. And, at the same time, to look for accounting software to transfer the account into a new system and pray that the system will work. If we are not able to do all these at the same time, we will be labelled as \"incompetent\".",
            "Hence, Mdm Speaker, under our current system, it seems to me that any Opposition Party which aspires to be elected in a GRC will have to build a town management team to train hundreds of staff officers first. Then, taking the advice of the Minister for National Development, start shopping for an off-the-shelf accounting software. If an Opposition Party aspires to be the next government, perhaps it may need to build an army of civil servants first. This is a strange political situation for any functioning democracy to be in.",
            "The Workers' Party was fortunate to have a Managing Agent at least with the experience in managing the town of Hougang Single Member Constituency, and who was prepared to take the challenge of managing a much larger town, to enable us to take over the management of the Aljunied GRC town, without major disruption to the services affecting the lives of thousands of residents. We did also have a financial accounting system in place although it fell short of features and functions that managing a larger town requires.",
            "I think this is not the way forward for the good of the nation. If we consider residents' interests as most important, then the Government must also protect residents' interests in the transition of town management from one Party to another Party. We are for transparency and accountability. We are not shy to support the motion that is critical of us but we will address and remedy the issues raised by AGO report.",
            "In fact, you will see from the speeches of my colleagues, we have already taken concrete steps to address and remedy many of the issues. We are fully aware that if we overlooked certain matters, the PAP Government will be the first to take us to account. We are not daunted by it, as this is what a First World Parliament should be â keep whoever is in charge on their toes, to do the job properly and be accountable to the people.",
            "AGO has taken a year to check the accounts of AHPETC for the Financial Year 2012/2013 and found lapses in several areas. It has not found the Town Council to be engaged in corrupt practices nor that any money had been lost or misappropriated after thousands of transactions were examined. We should put this episode in a proper perspective. Based on the Town Council Management Report, except S&CC arrears management and corporate governance, AHPETC's performance in other aspects of town management is comparable to other Town Councils.",
            "We support the motion to strengthen the legislative framework for Town Councils. As we relook the legislative framework, we need to look at the de-politicisation of the transitioning process and the professionalising of town management so that the incoming Town Councils can work to achieve good management and not be left stranded. Newly elected Members of Parliament should not be tested on whether they can build up town management systems from scratch, putting residents' interests at risk in the process.",
            "Finally, Madam, I would like to thank the residents living in the towns of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East, and the public for their concern and support. Despite the challenging political climate, the Workers' Party will continue to serve you to the best of its ability. Thank you."

We have given whatever documents we could to facilitate the audit, including documents with mistakes made or that it embarrassed us. The Town Council's has done its best to prioritise the audit with resources it has. The past year has been gruelling for the management and staff as we were running a \"live\" operation at the same time. The team auditing us consisted of eight members from the AGO and eight from Pricewaterhouse Coopers, a total of 16 for the past nine to 10 months. I wish to record my sincere thanks and appreciation to all those who worked long hours to complete the audit.",

            "Madam, in this debate, all the Members of Parliament of the town will be giving more insight into specific areas to enable the public to have a better understanding of the matter and the actions we have taken and are taking in response to the AGO audit. I will focus on the findings about the sinking funds and related party transactions.",
            "First, Madam, the sinking funds. We note that there could be a misunderstanding amongst some members of the public that the sinking fund monies were somehow lost. This is not the case. At all times, the monies that were not transferred to the sinking funds were still in the Town Council's operating fund bank accounts. The issue picked up concerns the transferring of the monies from one bank account to another. Let me explain how the omission of the transfer arose before I go into the corrective actions taken.",
            "Monies, such as income and Government grants, are first received into the Town Council's operating fund accounts. During FY2011 and 2012, the Town Council made some payments for sinking fund expenses out of the operating fund accounts, believing it could net off the sinking fund expenses before making the transfer to the sinking fund accounts later.",
            "The Town Council accepts that it should have transferred the full amounts due to the sinking funds each quarter and should have paid sinking fund expenses directly from the sinking fund accounts. We have taken steps and made good the transfers. For FY2011 and FY2012, the necessary transfers have been done. We have also done the transfers for FY2013 and have been making transfers for FY2014. As for the errors in transfer amounts flagged by the AGO, we have also made the corrections and payments.",
            "The AGO noted that the Town Council had wrongly used sinking funds for the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP). The TC had assumed that funds for the NRP should be deposited into sinking funds and paid from there. However, as there was actually no legal requirement to keep the NRP funds in sinking funds, we have corrected this and henceforth transacted for NRP projects out of routine or operating funds. This error arose because the Managing Agent had not encountered managing an NRP project before and was not certain whether such NRP monies should be transacted out of sinking funds or operating funds. This was not a case of using the sinking funds for the wrong purpose.",
            "Madam, there is still one issue to be attended to and that is the amount of GST refunds to be transferred back to sinking funds. This will take some time to unravel. Going forward, the Town Council will work with its IT system vendor to implement a function to capture sinking fund payments that attract GST. This will make it much easier to compute how much GST refunds from IRAS should go back into the sinking fund. The observation about the sinking fund lapses has thus been substantially addressed.",
            "Madam, next I move on to related party transactions (RPTs). The Town Council has never disputed that the Town Council and its Managing Agent (MA), FM Solutions and Services Pte Ltd, are deemed to be related parties under the financial reporting standards. In a small set-up like FMSS, which focuses on managing one town, it is inevitable that the Directors of the company would be involved in holding key positions in the Town Council as well. This issue of RPTs in our Town Council has been the focus of much media attention. Misimpressions have been created that the TC Secretary and its General Manager were the main directors and shareholders of the company, are freely being given contracts without tender and paying themselves handsomely without accountability. Contract values have been highlighted media headlines as if these were profit margins. It is necessary to highlight some key facts as these misimpressions need to be debunked.",
            "Number one, the MA has no decision-making power in relation to the award of tenders. Tenders are awarded by a Tenders and Contracts Committee consisting of Members of Parliament and appointed Councillors with no interest whatsoever in the MA.",
            "Two, the MA is not involved in evaluating any tender in which it is participating. When the MA and Essential Maintenance and Services Unit (EMSU) tenders are involved, the MA is excluded from the deliberations.",
            "Three, the only time FMSS was appointed to provide services without tender was in 2011 in the aftermath of the General Election. These waivers were only for two contracts for very short periods of time. One, for MA services for one year; and the other for EMSU services for nine months. These were transitional arrangements. For all subsequent contracts involving FMSS, open tenders were called and advertised in the papers accordingly.",
            "Five, for the first contract in 2011 for MA services, it was triggered as the incumbent MA, CPG Facilities Management, asked to be released from the contract with the TC for business reasons. There was an urgent need to put in place a computer system due to the termination of the former system in use. FMSS was appointed for a one-year period only to help the TC in the transition phase. Their rates were the rates that CPG FM charged the former Aljunied TC.",
            "Six, for the first contract in 2011 for EMSU, there was no intention to waive competition. The TC's preference was to extend the existing contractors until a tender could be called for the whole town. However, the existing contractors were not agreeable. FMSS was appointed to provide these services for nine months until the tender could be awarded for the Town. I shall elaborate more on this shortly.",
            "Seven, in 2012, open tenders were called for MA services as well as EMSU services for the six wards in Aljunied-Hougang Town. For MA services, three companies purchased the tender documents, including EM Services, that is, the Managing Agent for many PAP Town Councils. When the tender closed, only FMSS tendered to be Managing Agent (MA) for AHPETC. Prior to submitting the tender, FMSS also submitted their declaration of interest in accordance with Town Councils Financial Rule 76, sub-rule (3).",
            "Eight, as the Town Council was left to evaluate FMSS as the sole tenderer in 2012, the Town Council decided that it was prudent to have a tender process for the MA services, subject to a voluntary audit. It called for quotations from three audit firms and appointed one firm to do the review. The agreed upon scope included considering whether the current procedures and practices were adequate to ensure that the procurement was made in the ordinary course of business and whether there were adequate controls to ensure that the award was conducted in an unbiased, objective, fair and transparent manner. It also covered assessing whether the evaluation and award of the tender was conducted in accordance with existing requirements and good corporate governance practices. The auditors examined the records of the evaluation done and also sat in on an evaluation meeting. After this voluntary audit in 2012, the Town Council was graded \"A\".",

On the last page, Members will also see some additional channels by which the MA service levels are monitored by the Town Council, in particular, the Members of Parliament. Later on, my colleagues will also take Members through some of these points.",
            "Madam, in relation to the related party transactions, I would like now to talk about the disclaimer in the FY2012 financial statements on this point. In our Town Council's audit for FY2012, our auditors put in a disclaimer that because the project management fee details were not disclosed in the financial statements, they were unable to determine the completeness of the related party disclosures.",
            "The Town Council could not understand this at that time as there was no clarity of practice in the financial statements of Town Councils. For instance, the same auditors audited us in the earlier Financial Year 2011 and only required the related party disclosure to disclose MA fees. The former Aljunied Town Council Management also had related parties and yet there were no related party disclosures in the financial statements which had no disclaimers.",
            "Madam, the Town Council has no issue with disclosing the value of the related party transactions. Moving forward, we have suggested that the Ministry make it clear which parties are considered related in the Town Council's context. Most Town Councils are managed by managing agents with the Town Council's Secretary and General Manager being fairly senior staff in their respective companies. Should all TCs then make such related party disclosures?",
            "Madam, I also note that due to certain media reports, there may be a misconception that the values of the project management fees and EMSU fees paid to the MA were not recorded in the financial statements. Madam, there are no off-book payments whatsoever. These fees are recorded in the sinking funds expenses and operating fund's expenses. The auditors issue in FY2012 was that they wanted specific disclosures under a related party transaction heading. So, I thought it is important to clarify that.",
            "Madam, next, I like to move on to the AGO's finding on the EMSU contract that was awarded for nine months in 2011. AGO has flagged several lapses relating to this, such as not planning properly so as to call a tender and lack of due diligence in assessing the fee proposal. We agree we should have handled the situation better. However, please let me explain the situation at the time.",
            "The new team had just taken over management on 1 August 2011 and was focused on priorities such as stabilising the estate management operations and also of upscaling the computerised financial accounting system to cater to the GRC accounts. At that time, the EMSU services for the six wards in Aljunied-Hougang Town were then provided by three different contractors due to electoral boundary changes for GE 2011. Aljunied GRC had four wards serviced by CPG FM, one ward drawn over from Marine Parade GRC being serviced by EM Services and Hougang SMC being serviced by FM Solutions & Integrated Services.",
            "The TC had wanted to preserve the existing contractors until a tender could be called for EMSU services for the whole town. There were verbal discussions with CPG FM to extend their contract for six months but, in the end, it did not materialise. By the time the official reply was received, it was mid-September, two weeks before the contract expired on 30 September. The Town Council had appointed a committee to evaluate a proposal by FMSS to step in due to the urgency and the public interests.",
            "The committee met on Sunday, 18 September 2011 and went through the proposal to use the existing rates charged by CPG FM and EM Services. Unfortunately, it was not noticed that for two of the items, the wrong multiplier was used. The items were costed per equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) rather than the correct unit which should have been per block and per lift.",
            "There was a rounding of a unit rate to two decimal places instead of three, resulting in an erroneous calculation. Approval was obtained from the Town Councillors via email for an estimated fee of about $70,000 when the fees should have been in the region of about $50,000. We have gone back to investigate the matter. Though the approval was for a fee of $70,000, the actual amounts billed by FMSS were lower, being about $67,000 to $68,000 each month. The TC has since calculated the amounts, using the correct multipliers. There was an unintended overpayment to FMSS for the nine months. A sum of about $122,000 has since been paid back to the Town Council to correct the error.",
            "Why did the error occur? I bear personal responsibility as I was Chair of the Evaluation Committee. Despite the urgency of the matter, I should have ensured that the former contractor's invoices were sighted for comparison before the Committee accepted the pricing proposal and obtained the Town Council's approval. That said, the error was not deliberate. There was absolutely no intention on the part of the Committee nor the contractor to approve higher payment rates for this interim period of nine months.",
            "Next, Madam, I move on to the issue of disclosures of the related party transactions. It was pointed out that before entering contracts with FMSS, the relationships and extent of past or existing dealings should have been recorded, as considered by the Town Councillors. We note the advice and will exercise more diligence in detailing and recording the RPTs in future and discuss how to mitigate the risk. To this end, we will implement a checklist to be filled in by all tenderers and contractors to facilitate this.",
            "I wish to highlight, however, that in the circumstances there was little risk that the Town Councillors did not know of the relationships and the past contracts. At the time the contracts in 2011 and 2012 were entered into, the appointed Town Councillors remained the same. They knew of the circumstances of the formation of FMSS and contracts being awarded to FMSS and their values. When the tenders from FMSS were received, the ACRA-profile of FMSS was submitted and considered by the committees evaluating the tenders.",
            "Next, Madam, I move on to the issue of oversight of payments. Much has been published about the fact that the Secretary and General Manager issued invoices, certified work done and approved and signed cheques to FMSS. Appendix C, Attachment 1 and its total amount for 84 invoices of $6.6 million has been the subject of a front-page headline on 9 February 2015. The",
            "Lianhe Wanbao",
            "headline was entitled \"TC Secretary and GM pay their own companies $6.6 million\" and it has caused the intended alarm. However, Madam, the alarm is not warranted. Let me explain why.",
            "First, regarding cheque payments to FMSS, the Town Council had adopted an SOP on 8 September 2011, soon after the new management took over. It was the policy that no cheque to FMSS of whatever amount could be issued unless either the Town Council Chairman or one of the Vice Chairmen co-signed the cheque. Thus, it was not possible for FMSS to pay itself unless it was authorised by the Town Council Chair or Vice Chair who have no interest in FMSS whatsoever.",
            "Secondly, out of the amount of $6.6 million in payments, about 96% of that, or $6.4 million pertained to agreed monthly sums for MA and EMSU services rendered. These were monthly sums under contracts approved by the Town Council where the rates were already approved.",
            "Third, regarding the issue of segregation of duties, it is clear from Appendix C's list, if I may invite Members who have the report to look at Appendix C, the Attachment with the 84 invoices. Attachment 1 to Appendix C of the AGO report.",
            "It will be seen from this list of 84 invoices that from item 30 onwards to item 84, and this was following the appointment of a new finance manager, we adopted an approval process whereby there were three other persons who were not directors of the MA who were involved in the certification of work, issuing of payment vouchers and signing of cheques.",
            "In other words, the segregation of duties was done on the TC's own initiative within FY2012 itself. It should be noted that the bulk of the invoices in Attachment 1 are subject to the improved approval procedure; 55 out of 84 invoices were subjected to this improved segregation of duties. As for the 11 invoices highlighted by Pricewaterhouse where the General Manager also certified the work done, these were invoices before July 2012 and nine of them pertained to agreed monthly fees for EMSU and MA services approved by the TC earlier, leaving just two items, amounting to $1,165, which were not such agreed monthly fees.",
            "Madam, at this stage, may I have your permission to distribute",

            ":Â Â Thank you, Madam. As Members can see from Annex 3, there are three key points which I wish to highlight in the Annex. The first point is, again, to reiterate that out of the $6.6 million invoices, about 96% of them consist of monthly MA and EMSU payments which are based on fees approved by the TC earlier.",
            "Point number two, the point raised where the GM certified work done and approved the payment, 99.9% of these 11 invoices were again such pre-approved rates which had been endorsed by the TC earlier of MA and EMSU services. And the listing of the 11 invoices can be seen in the table here and Members will see that these are indeed for MA and EMSU services. If I can ask Members to turn over the page of Annex 3, the third point I would like to highlight once again is that as far as the segregation of duties is concerned, it can be seen from the Attachment 1, serial number 30 to 84 that at this juncture, we had already implemented the segregation where non-shareholder officers were involved in the payment approval process.",
            "Next, Madam, I would like to move on to the question which was asked to me and also of the Vice Chairs as to how we would verify that works were done before we sign the cheques. Madam, the three categories of works that these queries related to were FMSS' services for project management, MA services and EMSU services.",
            "So, Madam, first, I would like to touch on project management fees. For projects, the cheque signer would usually see the architects' certificate and the quantity surveyors' calculations of the value of the works done. The project management fee is a fixed 3.5% of the works. The auditor said that they were unable to verify what was presented to the cheque signer at the time, namely, FY2012. The Town Council had explained that the supporting documents had been detached after the cheques were signed as they needed to be filed by the Estate and Projects Department. So, Madam, it should be remembered that these transactions took place in FY2012.",
            "Next, for the MA payments, which are based on agreed monthly rates, the level of services provided is subject to evaluation on a daily basis. These include some of the channels that are mentioned in Annex 2, and I would not want to belabour the point. I think Members can read from Annex 2. If there are other best practices from other Town Councils which other Town Council Chairs would like to share on how they verify that the MA monthly payments are due before signing the cheques, I would be very enlightened to hear what can further be done.",
            "Next, Madam, for the EMSU services, how do we check whether the services have been rendered? Monthly reports are churned out to show performance based on time of response and actions taken based on various indicators.",
            "Next, Madam, how are we going to manage the related petty transactions better? We have started to introduce more oversight into works and payments to the MA and in this regard, Annex 2 is also relevant, which we distributed earlier. But I would also like to highlight a couple of points.",
            "First, as regards project management, we continue to require the architects' and quantity surveyors' certificates before processing project management fees. Since April 2013, the Members of Parliament have started attending project meetings to assess the necessity for works and the details. Since late 2014, the Town Council's Estate and Community Liaison Committee has been passed to approve works and project management fees before the works commenced. The Town Council Chair is also now asked to sign off on works orders before invoices are issued for project management fees.",
            "Next, Madam, for MA and EMSU fees, additional procedures have been introduced. Instead of direct invoicing, a Works Order is raised by the Office Manager and countersigned by the Town Council Chairman. Thereafter, FMSS would raise its invoice, which is forwarded to the Finance Department. The payment voucher would be approved by the Deputy General Manager before the cheque is issued. These enhancements were noted by Pricewaterhouse in the report, Appendix C, at para 1.39.",
            "Madam, going forward, we will draw up a checklist in assessing tenders and contracts to ensure that the necessary information is captured and presented to the persons deciding on awards. The decision-makers can then also decide on how best to manage the conflicts of interest.",
            "Madam, before I end, I would like to just respond to three points raised by the Minister earlier when he presented the motion. First of all, the Minister stated that the Town Council or the Members of Parliament had shown disrespect to the auditors and to Parliament by not providing information.",
            "Now, Madam, this is not the case at all. I would like to highlight to the House that thousands of documents were given to the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). As an example, they looked at 16,481 Works Orders. And if we looked at the appendices that are attached to the AGO report, they were actually much shorter than what they originally were, meaning the attachment which Pricewaterhouse included in the report saying that certain matters are outstanding.",
            "Members who have the AGO report, if you care to turn, I would like to highlight certain things. Appendix C, this is page 3, Attachment 2. Members will see that there is one payment voucher outstanding but there were actually originally 22 requests; there is only one outstanding. Attachment 3, there are three items outstanding out of an original 75. And if Members look at Attachment 4, although the heading says \"Outstanding contracts, quotations, supplemented agreement\" and so on, if Members were to read the last column of that table, PwC's response, Members will see that actually, the auditors confirmed that they have received most, if not all, of the documents. So, I urge Members to note that. We have done our best to provide whatever information we could to the auditors.",
            "Next, Madam, the Minister highlighted the fact that our financial statements were late and, in particular, he mentioned the financial statements of FY2013/2014. Minister would of course recall that the AGO audit was called in February 2014 and continued from March 2014 all the way until January. So, all the papers were stuck for this audit and it was not reasonably possible for the FY2013 annual audit to commence while this audit was going on.",
            "In his speech earlier, the Minister mentioned that some of the conditions that he might want to impose on the Town Council, going forward, is that he would require us to submit our financial statements for FY2013 and FY2014 within certain timelines, I believe he said June and August. Well, Minister, we are not certain whether we can meet these timelines but we will discuss with MND what is possible after discussion with our auditors."

            "Madam, one more point which the Minister brought up was the issue of cyclical information. He mentioned that our Town Council was slow to submit the information to MND and I would like to just make a few points so that there is no unnecessary worry on the part of our residents.",
            "First, I think Minister would know that we have been corresponding with MND and making the submissions. Admittedly, we are late but we have submitted some things and we are discussing with MND on some of those issues. So, it is not as if we have not paid attention to it.",
            "Secondly, Madam, Minister alluded to lifts and saying that there might be concerns about whether the lifts are overhauled in time, and so on and so forth. So, I would like to just state some facts based on the information that I have.",
            "The current state in our town is that, in terms of lift overhauls, there are just 12 lifts that are overdue for overhaul, so we will be attending to them. Some of the other lifts are due for the Selective Lift Replacement Programme. All the parts, hoist ropes and all that are up to date. And for the battery replacements, we are replacing them on schedule as per the MND timelines. So, that is the situation with lifts. I just wanted to make that clear, so that the residents are not unduly concerned about those comments.",
            "So, Madam, for now, let me round up. FY2012 was a full year of our operations in Aljunied-Hougang Town, and despite the almost year-long intensive audit, the 16 auditors have not uncovered any basis to suspect deliberate malpractice nor any loss of funds. There has been no finding that we have been dishonest or have falsified records. Despite the issues in financial management, our residents' interests have not been compromised.",
            "Madam, I have set out the circumstances leading to the lapses in relation to the management of sinking funds and the related-party transactions, so that the public may more fully understand what led to them. We thank the public and especially our residents for their kind understanding and support of our work. We will continue to put in efforts to do better. Thank you, Madam."

In my following speech, I would speak on existing measures that have already been set in place to ensure that public monies are spent and utilised in the most appropriate and cost-effective manner. In doing so, I would elaborate the points realised and substantiated by my colleague, Ms Sylvia Lim.",
            "In AHPETC, we have in place several Committees to look into the different operational aspects of the Town Council, one of which is known as Estate and Community Liaison Committee (ECLC). Formed in 2012, this Committee is made up of a Chairman, elected Town Councillors and other members appointed by the elected Councillors. This Committee works closely with the Estate teams in the Town Council made up of property managers and property officers.

The entire process entails a proper and detailed account of the problem at hand, the rationale behind the works, the costs involved, and the various standards obtained. Pertinent points of discussion often include whether a particular project, if necessary, is cost-effective and benefits the most number of residents.",

There should be greater safeguards that we can put in place to ensure greater accountability in the use of public monies.

Now, questions and doubts over this issue are being cleared with the release of the Auditor General's report. The operation of the Town Councils is about people's livelihood. Hence, MND must raise this issue in Parliament. I sincerely hope that, in this august chamber, we can find out where the problem lies and improve the Town Council's management and efficiency, and clear people's doubts.",
            "First, please allow me to explain the sequence of events so that we have a complete picture. During the 2011 election, Worker's Party's slogan was to build a First-world Parliament. WP emphasised then that the benefit of a First-world Parliament was for the public to better scrutinise the policy, strengthen accountability and transparency of the governments. This slogan received support from the people of the Aljunied GRC.",
            "After the election, WP promised that they would do their best to manage the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. In 2012, during the Hougang by-election, Ms Sylvia Lim, an MP of the Aljunied GRC, emphasised that WP had a dedicated and experienced management team and WP did a good job in managing Hougang Town Council before. Hence, they had the confidence to run Aljunied-Hougang Town Council well. During the 2013 Punggol East by-election, Mr Chen Show Mao, also an MP of the Aljunied GRC, said WP would manage the Town Council in a proper and responsible manner. Then WP candidate Ms Lee Li Lian, too, said that she herself also had the expertise and experience in Town Council management, hence they had the ability to manage the Town Council well. During this period, WP Members of Parliament frequently criticised the Governments for lacking accountability and transparency, and at the same time constantly emphasised how able and dedicated the WP team was.",
            "Besides emphasising their own Town Council management ability, WP also targeted Town Councils managed by the PAP. At the Punggol East by-election rally, Ms Lim, as Chairman of the WP-run Town Council, revealed that when setting up the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council after winning the election, they discovered the dealings between PAP Town Councils and the company AIM. Ms Lim questioned that, for PAP-run Town Councils to sell a management system developed with public money to a PAP-linked company, was it in the public interest? She implied that this could create nepotism. Mr Pritam Singh, Deputy Chairman of the WP-run Town Council, also raised a series of questions. He said that for the first time in history, people had found out there were PAP-owned companies, and Singaporeans wanted to know how many companies PAP owned in Singapore and overseas. What do these companies do, who are the directors? WP Members of Parliament sounded very eloquent and righteous over this AIM issue. Maybe this is because when you care deeply, you also criticise strongly?",
            "PAP has explained in Parliament in detail over the questions WP raised. And because of this, the Government has also launched a formal investigation over the AIM transactions. The investigation showed that the AIM service did not harm residents' interest whatsoever; on the contrary, by providing services to 14 Town Councils, it achieved economies of scale and brought benefits to the residents. Minister for National Development Mr Khaw Boon Wan also pointed out that PAP only had one company which was AIM, whose purpose was to provide computer management services to 14 PAP Town Councils. Because the WP has taken a firm stand over the AIM issue and shown strong resolve of accountability, people felt that the slogan of building a First-world Parliament was not merely a slogan but a political vision.",
            "The wheels of history keep rolling forward and things change all the time. While the memory of the AIM debate is still fresh in our mind, today we are here again discussing the Town Council management issue. However, this time round, it is the WP-run AHPETC that is in the spotlight, and the situation is far worse. For the second consecutive year, the independent auditor appointed by the Town Council themselves issued a Disclaimer of Opinion over the Town Council's financial report. It is very rare for an auditor to do that. MND took this matter seriously and openly expressed its concerns. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, at the request of Minister Khaw, instructed the Auditor General's Office (AGO) to audit AHPETC's last financial year's accounts. After a year's work, the AGO Report was finally released a few days ago.",
            "The AGO Report showed that there were five major areas of lapses In AHPETC: First, it didn't transfer monies into its sinking-fund as required by law; second, it had inadequate oversight of related-party transactions; third, it lacks a system to monitor S&CC arrears; fourth, there were lapses in internal controls and procurement; fifth, there were no proper document keeping and safeguards. Minister Khaw just now moved a motion regarding this Report to strengthen the legislative framework and oversight of Town Councils. It is very appropriate!",
            "When dealing with the AIM issue, the Governments has taken it seriously and did not evade the questions raised by the WP. Now, the discussion focus is on the WP-run Town Council, the Governments will treat it equally and take the same stance and attitude. This is because the incident is not just about the financial management, oversight and efficiency of the WP-run AHPETC, it also serves as an alarm to all other Town Councils, be they run by the ruling party or the opposition. The management of the Town Councils involves large amount of public money and concerns the people's interests, therefore, it cannot be taken lightly.",
            "The Report showed that there were five major areas of lapses in the management and administration of AHPETC. Overall, I think two particular points demand special attention. First, how is the quality of the AHPETC management team? If the quality is good, then there shouldn't have been so many lapses in compliance and oversight. This is a stark contrast to the WP claim earlier that their team was very competent, experienced and dedicated! Although, for the short term, these lapses in financial management and oversight will not impact the daily operations, such as cleaning, trash clearing and maintenance, if they are left unsolved, they will accumulate and eventually get out of hand; the consequence can be dire and will affect the residents' interests negatively.",
            "Second, AHPETC did not properly manage the conflicts of interests brought about by key TC officers being director or shareholder of other companies. The Report discovered that the Secretary of AHPETC is also the owner of the company that provides EMSU (Essential Maintenance Service Unit) to the Town Council; and the Secretary, General Manager and the two Deputy General Managers are also the directors or shareholders of the Managing Agent (MA) appointed by the Town Council. The General Manager and the Secretary had, on behalf of the MA, submitted 84 invoiced worth $6.61 million to the Town Council. Among them, 11 invoices worth $1.69 million were verified by the General Manager, and nine invoices worth $260,000 were verified by the Deputy General Manager. Payment of all these invoices was subsequently approved by the General Manager.",
            "If the one who issues the invoice and the one who verifies and approves the payment is the same person, then it is very hard to say the Town Council is making it clear between personal and public interests. Any professional companies and organisations of a decent size would try to avoid, even prevent the conflicts of interests between their staff and the contractor. The public would hope WP to have a mechanism to mitigate and deal with such conflicts, and to prevent nepotism. I am very pleased to hear Ms Lim's promise just now that going forward, they will correct all the shortcomings. This is a positive development! This was also the key point the WP had raised during the AIM saga. In addition, the Report also pointed out that there was insufficient disclosure and transparency in the Town Council's management. For example, the relationship between the Secretary, the General Manager and the MA was not recorded in the minutes of the Town Council's meetings, hence there are no documents to show that prior to signing the contract with the MA, the Town Council had taken into account of the potential conflicts of interests and made any provisions to prevent corruption.",
            "The Town Council did not, according to the Town Councils Act, record and safeguard documents properly. Hence they can't produce relevant accounting documents to the independent auditor appointed by the Town Council, resulting in two consecutive years of \"Disclaimer of Opinion\" by the auditor. If this is a listed company, this kind of financial statement will be considered as seriously flawed and the company directors and the management will have to resign or be sacked.",
            "After the Report was released, many experts, academia, and even former NMPs have expressed their views. Overall, they believe that the five areas of lapses are very serious and should be addressed. These are all industry experts whose professional views cannot be easily ignored.",
            "This incident highlighted that, with regard to the accountability of Town Council management, the Governments should take more proactive actions, strengthen the laws to empower relevant Government agencies and ensure good governance in all Town Councils. When the Town Council is at fault, it should be held accountable, be it run by the ruling party or the opposition. The current Town Councils Act does not allow this. MND has realised this and the Minister is moving this motion to review the relevant laws to strengthen oversight and improve Town Councils' governance.",
            "According to Lianhe Wanbao's report on Monday, Mr Low Thia Khiang had earlier said in an interview that, \"the fact that the Town Council did not meet the standard in terms of S&CC arrears and governance did not affect the Town Council's operation and services. There is no need for people to worry.\" People cannot help but to think of the time when the WP was lashing out at AIM. It actually did not affect the Town Council's daily operations and services, but why then the WP was so concerned and bombarding the PAP Town Councils? Now it is the WP Town Council that is being questioned, but you tell the residents not to worry, I wonder how the people will feel about this. Let us look at it from another angle and say it is a PAP Town Council that has made the five mistakes listed in the Report, and the person in charge of the PAP Town Council had said, \"Do not worry, it is really nothing. Relax!\" Will the WP accept this explanation? Will the people accept it?",
            "One must walk the talk. I think this is a question of integrity and moral values, as well as a political one. Good political competition should be based on reason and morality, only with that can we have clean politics and the country can progress.",
            "It was recorded in Analects' chapter Xian Wen that Zilu once asked Confucius what the way of the gentleman was. Confucius said, \"To cultivate oneself so as to be proper.\" Zilu asked further, \"Is this good enough?\" Confucius said, \"To cultivate oneself so as to make others peaceful.\" Zilu asked again, \"So that's it\"? Confucius said, \"To cultivate oneself so as to make the whole world peaceful.\" In \"Great Learning\", it was summarised as \"cultivate oneself, manage the family, govern the country and attain world peace.\" If you don't cultivate yourself, your family won't be at peace; if families are in disarray, the country will be in a mess, how can you have a First-world Parliament then?",
            "As Members of Parliament, representing the voice of the people, we should hold high standard for ourselves. This is our duty. I am not saying we should try to be like Confucius and be a saint. What I mean is, without self-cultivation, our democratic politics will have no content and morals, and our country will not develop in a healthy manner.",
            "Talking about this, I remembered Aljunied GRC Member of Parliament Mr Chen Show Mao's maiden speech in Parliament in 2011, which had left a deep impression on me. Allow me to quote: \"The reign of Zhenguan, the golden age of enlightened rule in Chinese history, was not characterised by a \"one-man-court\" that brooked no dissension. There was Weizheng who was famous for being unafraid to speak hard truths in admonitions that caused offence to the Emperor Tang Taizong. Without either, there would not be the golden age of Zhenguan. In this Twelfth Parliament, I hope a wise ruling party can be Tang Taizong, and we can be Weizheng. Together, we can work to usher in a period of prosperity and peace for the nation, not an age of domineering leaders ruling over a petty people living in submission.\" I remember I praised his speech in Parliament and said his words had brought in some fresh air. I also said then we should give him more applause for that. In my concluding speech then, I emphasised that, \"since MP Chen is using Wei Zheng as an example that he would like to emulate, when his view is different from that of his party, I hope he will be able to look at the big picture and express his view, and not be a 'yes-man' to his party.\"",
            "With regard to this WP Town Council issue, where the accounts are in a mess and there are inadequate transparency and lapses in governance, Mr Chen has not said anything at any public forums yet. Has he become a member of the \"One-Man-Court\" and a blind follower of his party? Fortunately, I saw Mr Chen's name on today's speakers' list and I look forward to Mr Chen's views on the whole incident.",
            "Mr Chen is a very experienced top lawyer and was once in charge of several companies' public listing projects worth tens of billions of dollars. He should have his independent views on whether the Town Council is managed in a transparent, fair and professional way. Thinking back of Mr Chen's words in 2011, they sounded so righteous and powerful. I urge Mr Chen, in the fearless spirit of Wei Zheng, to express his unbiased, professional and independent views on this issue. Otherwise, it will give people the impression that his words are not matching his deeds!",
            "Thank you, Mdm Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak. Again, I support the Motion moved by Minister Khaw."

            ":Â Â Mdm Speaker, with regard to the Auditor-General's Report, the Aljunied Hougang and Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC) has given its formal written reply. In response, the Auditor-General has made further comments. Responses upon responses are recorded in the report. If you wish to have an accurate assessment of the matter, I hope you will find time to read the report and decide whether the Town Council has provided reasons or mere excuses.",
            "Now that the issues, responses and responses to the responses have all been published, I, nevertheless, wish to speak. This is because AHPETC residents have entrusted the Town Council to us, and we have the responsibility to do our job well and be accountable to them.",
            "I would like to clarify a few points on related-party transactions, and offer my views.",
            "A town council basically comprises a group of residents and their local MPs; they manage the common areas in HDB estates, such as the void decks and common corridors, and collect from the residents service and conservancy charges for the cleaning and maintenance of the common areas. This is somewhat similar to the functions of management committees of private condominiums and, like them, the majority of town councils in Singapore appoint external vendors to provide requisite services, such as cleaning and maintenance, as well as emergency lift services.",
            "Among these services, the most important is for the management of the town council. The company that provides such management services is called the managing agent of the town council.",
            "Once successfully appointed, the managing agent will typically appoint its senior management staff to accept the appointment by the town council as the town council's secretary, general manager and other key officers. This is also how we manage AHPETC.",
            "One consequence is, however, that transactions between the Town Council and its Managing Agent can become related-party transactions.",
            "The Auditor-General indicated in the Report that related party transactions are not against the law, but need to be disclosed. To whom should they be disclosed? A few examples are given. Back when the Town Council was discussing whether it should enter into a new contract with the Managing Agent, a written disclosure should have been provided to Town Councillors who were to make the decision, to notify them of the relationships between the parties of this related-party transaction. As the Chairman of the Town Council reported earlier: we accept the suggestion; it is good practice to provide such formal written disclosure. She also pointed out that the Town Councillors who were to approve the new contract were the same ones who approved the initial contract a year earlier: they were familiar with the Managing Agent â how it was established and its relationship with the Town Council after it was appointed. These were the same Town Councillors. We are now talking about contract renewal; the Town Councillors were familiar with the Managing Agent from when the contract was signed initially. It does not mean that the Town Council could not have provided written disclosure to the Town Councillors: we will continue to work hard in this respect.",
            "Second, to whom else should the disclosure be made? The related-party transactions should also be stated in the financial statements of the Town Council. As our Chairman reported, the Town Council is not against the disclosure. It only hopes to have more standard guidance on the disclosure requirement, and under what circumstances: why do you disclose but I don't; why didn't I have to disclose in the past but need to do so now? The Town Council is not against disclosure and is happy to comply, and would welcome guidance on the relevant form of disclosure.",
            "The AGO Report referred to 84 payments made to related parties within the year. Most of these payments â 96% of the total sum involved â were amounts payable under the relevant contracts. In other words, important terms, such as the payable rate, frequency of payment, and mode of payment, had already been determined in the contracts signed earlier between the Town Council and the service providers.",
            "To appoint an external vendor as the managing agent means you outsource the management and administration functions. However, while management can be outsourced, supervision cannot be outsourced.",
            "The Chairman of the Town Council has reported that since September 2011, soon after the takeover of the Town Council, all cheques issued to the Managing Agent are required to be co-signed by the Chairman or Vice Chairmen, in addition to signatures of the Town Council's officers. In other words, all payments must be approved by the Chairman or the Vice Chairmen. None of the Secretary, the General Manager or any other Town Council officer is able to request for and approve the payment all on his or her own. The Chairman of the Town Council has reported that when the Chairman or Vice Chairmen approve the payments, it is based on certificates issued by architects or surveyors, computer reports or some other feedbacks.",

Honest people, they work hard to raise their families, make a living and pay their service and conservancy charges every month. They trusted the Workers' Party with their hard-earned money. The AGO report raises serious questions about the conduct of the AHPETC Town Councillors and what they did with the money of the honest residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East.",
            "There are four major questions that arise from the facts which have come out. One, the AGO report makes clear that the AHPETC Town Councillors allowed millions of dollars to be paid to related parties in breach of their legal, fiduciary duties. The payments were unlawful.",
            "Two, these payments were done without transparency or accountability. There was no full and frank disclosures of the facts and there was no discussion of the conflicts of interests.",
            "Three, the AHPE Town Council suffered a loss because of the payments to the related parties. I will refer to AHPETC as the Town Council.",
            "Four, what is the responsibility of each of the Town Councillors for these payments? What did each of them know? What role did each play in paying monies to the related parties?",
            "Let me deal with each of these four points.",
            "First, on the payment of the millions to related parties. The Town Council allowed millions of dollars to be paid to the related parties. On 8 May 2011, the Workers' Party won Aljunied. Seven days later, on 15 May 2011, a husband and wife, Mr Loh and Ms How, set up a company, FMSS. Loh also owned a sole proprietorship, FMSI. The Town Council gave the MA contract to FMSS in 2011. The Town Council also gave three more contracts to FMSS over the years. The total value of the contracts was about $27 million.",
            "Ms How became the General Manager and Mr Loh the Secretary of the Town Council. Another FMSS shareholder, Mr Yeo, became the Deputy General Manager of the Town Council.",
            "One has to ask: Ms How and Yeo were employees of the Hougang Town Council. They could have been employed by AHPETC. There was no need to set up a new company to provide services to the Town Council. So, why set up FMSS? It was a convenient vehicle to which millions of dollars went from the Town Council. And another obvious question: money that went to FMSS â where did it actually go? What happened to it?",

Ms How then approved the payment vouchers and cheques to be issued by the Town Council for payment to her own companies, FMSS and FMSI. Loh then, on behalf of the Town Council, signed the cheques for payments to his companies. The cheques were then co-signed either by Ms Sylvia Lim or Mr Png.

If similar payments were made in other years, then it would not be much less than $20 million. We do not know the full amount because there has been no audit for the period from May 2011 to January 2015.",
            "This process is unacceptable. It is also unlawful.",
            "It is a common practice across Singapore that when a Town Council engages a Managing Agent (MA), a major part of the MA contract is to provide the Town Council with its key management personnel to supervise the running of the Town Council day to day. We would thus naturally expect the Town Council's key management personnel â its Secretary, General Manager, Deputy General Managers â to be employees of the MA.",
            "MND does not prohibit this. MND has allowed it in response to Town Councils' feedback. However, in all these 25 years, in no other Town Councils except AHPETC are the Secretary, the General Manager, the Deputy General Managers of the Town Council not just employees of the MA, but also complete owners of the MA. Their ownership interests and control of the MA is what distinguishes AHPETC from all other Town Councils. That makes any transaction between the Town Council, and FMSS and FMSI a related party transaction that has to be disclosed under FRS (Financial Reporting Standard).",
            "I heard with some interest Mr Chen, who has considerable experience, saying there are no standards. I think Mr Chen has overlooked the FRS. The FRS sets out what ought to be disclosed. The only difference is that AHPETC acted in breach of the FRS. Everybody else complied with the FRS. So, there are no new standards to look for. The standards are there. One just has to follow the rules.",
            "The ownership and control of the Managing Agent, in the case of AHPETC, is what distinguishes that Town Council from all other Town Councils. That makes any transactions between the Town Council, and FMSS or FMSI a related party transaction. And under the FRS, if someone is a General Manager or Secretary of the Town Council, and at the same time, employed by the MA, that is not considered a related party transaction, unless that person has control or joint control of the Managing Agent. In all other Town Councils, no one had such control, and the auditors rasied no queries. For AHPETC, its own auditors raised queries, which the Town Council refused to answer.",
            "This is not a question of negligence. This is not a question of inexperience. When employees do not own the MA, they cannot be said to have a serious personal financial interest in each such transaction. But with AHPETC, the position was different. The Managing Agent was owned by Loh, Ms How and Yeo. The payments they were verifying and approving on behalf of the Town Council were going directly into their own pockets. This is not a theoretical conflict of interest. It is a real conflict. Husband and wife were issuing invoices on behalf of their own company. They were often verifying, on behalf of the Town Council, the work done by themselves. They were also certifying, on behalf of the Town Council, the payments to their own companies. The wife was then approving, on behalf of the Town Council, the cheques for payment to their own companies, and the husband was then signing the Town Council's cheques for payments to themselves. I think Mr Chen will accept that this is unacceptable. You do not need an FRS to know that this is contrary to the law.",
            "This arrangement was designed deliberately. It was not accidental. It is with a husband and wife team who are hard core supporters of the Workers' Party, and close to some of the Workers' Party Town Councillors. They must have been highly trusted; they were the assenter and proposer for the Workers' Party in the General Elections of 2006. The conflict of interest is apparent, real and serious. No Town Councillor who knew of this structure could have approved this structure lawfully. It is not capable of being approved in law. It is unlawful. And it would have been a serious breach of fiduciary duties for any Town Councillor to have approved this process.",
            "During the AGO audit, the Town Council responded on this related party transaction. It said, \"Well, most of the payments were pre-agreed by contract\". That is what Ms Lim told this House today as well. And the cheques were countersigned by the Chairman or Vice Chairman. With respect, these are non-answers. The payments may have been pre-agreed by contract but were the services being provided, let alone provided properly? Payments are being made for services. Who was checking on the services for which the millions were being paid? And the cheques being countersigned, what does that mean? What were the checks done for each payment? It is all quite unacceptable, and unlawful.",
            "When pointed out, instead of accepting that this is unlawful and unacceptable, there is now an attempt to confuse and evade. So, serious questions remain unanswered on payments.",
            "I have said I will highlight two ways in which payments were made to FMSS amongst several. Let me deal with the second way in which the Town Council was run for the benefit of FMSS. That was by inflating the MA fees paid to FMSS.",
            "The Town Council decided to pay significantly higher MA fees to FMSS, compared with all other Town Councils. The total MA fees paid by the Town Council to FMSS were nearly $22 million for over four years. Mdm Speaker, may I ask for",

            "].",
            "If Members look at this, you can see from this Annex that FMSS charges the Town Council $14.92 for each commercial unit compared with between $4.80 and $6.65 for all other Town Councils. Is this inexperience? Is this oversight? Is this a case of playing the victim, coming here and saying we are all victims of a political conspiracy? This is what you decided to pay. Small businesses in Aljunied were charged much more to pay FMSS. Likewise, FMSS charged the Town Council $7.43 for every residential unit. Others charge between $4.80 and $6.65.",
            "And from July 2014, FMSS increased its rates even more. The rates are now $15.82 and $7.88. The commercial unit rates and Managing Agent's fees are now more than double what everyone else has charged. If you take the weighted average of MA fees paid by other Town Councils, it is $5.72 per unit for both residential and commercial units. The difference, therefore, on an annual basis, between what the Town Council paid FMSS and what others pay their Managing Agents is about $1.6 million every year.",
            "That is not the profit. That is just the difference. Obviously, everybody else makes a profit too. So, this $1.6 million is on top of the profit that FMSS was making. You can compare the rates any way you like. Weighted average; you can compare it with Tampines, which is comparable; you can compare it with Chua Choa Kang, which has got a similar number of units. Whatever way you slice it, Aljunied pays far more to FMSS. What justifies this?",
            "The rhetoric from the Workers' Party is always about helping the poor man. The reality is that the Workers' Party took money from the man in the street to give to their friends in FMSS. Mr Low and Ms Lim keep saying there has been no loss. Maybe there was no one taking money through the backdoor in the dark of the night. There was no need because the money was taken from the front door in broad daylight. Through all this overcharging â $6.4 million over four years on this calculation, overcharging on managing agent's fees. Another $6.6 million taken out in just one year through an unlawful process. There might be an overlap between the two sums because part of the $6.6 million would be for MA fees. And there must have been much more.",
            "I will now deal with the second major problem arising from the facts, which is lack of transparency and lack of disclosure. Ask yourself: should the full facts have been disclosed to all the Town Councillors? Should the process have been discussed? Should the risks have been considered? Should the safeguards have been thought about?",
            "The answers to these questions might appear obvious. The behaviour of a party which claims to champion transparency and accountability was shocking. First, the facts do not seem to have been fully disclosed to all the Town Councillors. Second, there seems to have been no proper discussion of the conflicts at all.",
            "Let me deal with the non-disclosure first. If Members look again at Annex 1 that was handed out earlier, the fact that Loh, Ms How and Yeo owned FMSS â that is obviously important. You would expect it to be disclosed and discussed at the Town Council meeting. But strangely, there are no minutes of Town Council meetings where any such disclosure is recorded. Instead it gets very curious. The minutes show that between August and September 2011, the Town Councillors were given limited disclosure. They were only told that Loh and Ms How were directors and employees of FMSS .Very odd. It was felt necessary to tell the rest of the Town Councillors that Ms How and Loh were directors and employees of FMSS, but not reveal the more important fact that they were not just employees and directors, but also the owners of FMSS.",
            "PwC asked the Town Council why was there no record of Loh, Ms How and Yeo's ownership being disclosed and discussed at the Town Council meeting. The Town Council says, \"Oh, everyone knew the ownership structure of FMSS.\"",
            "Really? Every Town Councillor knew? Then, why did the Town Council make the curious decision to only record that they were directors and employees, and not record their ownership of FMSS and FMSI? What was there to hide about the ownership? Why record only some of the less important facts and omit the most important fact?",
            "And there is no reference whatsoever in the minutes to FMSI, that it was owned by Loh. FMSI got contracts worth $29,400 per month for five years â October 2007 to June 2012. And Loh's ownership was not mentioned or recorded?",
            "Obviously, some of the Town Councillors would have known that Loh and Ms How owned FMSS. Could Ms Sylvia Lim not have known? She was the Chairman of the Town Council. So, did she tell the other Town Councillors? What exactly did she tell? Were the ownership details recorded or revealed?",
            "Beyond this limited disclosure, there is nothing else in the Town Council minutes. And over the years, there was no further disclosure of the interests. Nothing. Despite the many contracts and millions that were given to FMSS and FMSI.",
            "Now, let me deal with the second major problem on transparency, the discussion on conflicts, or rather, the absence of discussion on conflicts. Surprisingly, there seems to have been no record of any discussion whatsoever by the Town Council on the process that you see outlined in Annex 1 where they pay themselves, that almost every aspect of the payment process would be controlled by FMSS. Nothing disclosed, nothing discussed.",
            "Again, some Town Councillors must have known about the process and they must have approved it. Could Ms Sylvia Lim, as Chairperson, not have known? Why did she not discuss it with all the other Town Councillors? There is no record that she did so.",
            "In response to queries by PwC as part of the AGO audit, what response did the Town Council give? Just guess. Instead of answering the questions, they said, \"This is not within your remit to ask.\"",
            "That is an evasion; it is not an answer. The auditor asks you serious questions and your response is, \"You are not entitled to ask me these questions.\" Why does not the Town Council give proper answers instead of playing hide and seek? What are you hiding?",
            "This is not negligence. It is an active decision to suppress. It raises the issue of integrity. The issue of integrity is raised right through. This pattern of non-disclosure and murkiness has been a constant and troubling feature.",
            "One, as we saw, the Town Council minutes suggest that the Town Councillors were not given the full details on FMSS. Or if they were given the details, then someone decided that only the less important parts should be recorded.",
            "Two, there seems to have been no discussion at Town Council meetings of the actual process. There is no record that this took place, how FMSS would be supervised, and how the risks will be mitigated.",
            "Three, the Town Council's own auditors, Foo Kon Tan, queried them on transactions with FMSS. The Town Council failed to answer them. As a result, Foo Kon Tan qualified their audit report, and said \"the Town Council had not made available to us details of the project management service fees paid to a related party. Accordingly, we are unable to determine the completeness of the related party disclosures\". These are your own auditors. The Town Council refused to give information to its own auditors, and you keep talking about transparency.",
            "And the Town Council failed to disclose the details of its contracts with FMSS in its FY2012/2013 accounts. And so, the report went on to say, \"AHPETC did not disclose fully the related party transactions in its financial statements.\" This was in breach of the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (FRS). Again, Mr Chen, the rules are all there. You just need to comply with them.",
            "The FRS requires disclosure of related party transactions in financial statements. The pattern of non-disclosure is obvious.",
            "And the Town Council also refused to give details to PwC â which was requested as part of the AGO audit, and I quote from the AGO report, \"we noted that AHPETC has entered into a number of RPTs whereby substantial sums were paid to related parties in FY2012/2013. The Town Council (\"TC\"), despite repeated requests, did not provide us with all the critical documents relating to these transactions.\"",
            "I quote again, \"Since the commencement of our review in April 2014, we have made various requests for documents from AHPETC as part of our review of selected transactions. In our view, these documents (such as documents which record the proper disclosure and consideration of RPTs) ought to exist as a matter of record. Notwithstanding numerous requests and reminders, AHPETC did not provide a number of the requested documents.\"",
            "Right through, active, persistent non-disclosure. Obviously deliberate. And the consequence of all of this? Of the millions that were paid to FMSS, who knows how much was justifiable?",
            "That brings me to the third of the four major issues that I have highlighted monies lost by the Town Council. Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low have been quick to say that despite all the problems, no Town Council monies have been lost. Really?",
            "Can she or anyone else honestly say that no monies have been lost? When the Town Councillors act in breach of their fiduciary duties, and paid Loh and Ms How millions of dollars, that is not a loss to the Town Council? Over-payment to a related party is not a loss? That is a really strange statement from Ms Lim. The house is burning, and she is standing in front of it and says, \"You know, there has been no loss.\"",
            "Is it possible that she does not recognise loss even when it is staring before her face?",
            "Let us try and put a number on the monies that have been paid to FMSS in breach of fiduciary duties.",
            "Firstly, the MA fees of $22 million. As we saw earlier, the over-charging could be about $6.4 million, perhaps more. That is the over-payment by the Town Council to FMSS for MA fees. Is that not a loss? Add in other amounts which were paid to FMSS, without any adequate check or control; $6.6 million in one year. Four years â what would the figure be? You get a lot of money paid by the Town Council to FMSS. So, just on these figures, perhaps over four years, $20 million? You add the $6.4 million, of course, there will be some overlap â because part of the $20 million would be part of the MA fees. But that is before you even look at issues like blatant double charging or over-charging.",
            "Just one illustration of that. Four Town Councillors who were asked to look at the FMSS' fee proposal to provide essential services. Some of the elected Members of Parliament must have been on the Committee. They briefed the other Town Councillors on the fee. They told the Town Councillors that the fee would be about the same as what was the previously charged fee. The previously charged fee was about $49,000 per month. But the four Town Councillors misled the others. FMSS actually charged $67,000 per month and it was not picked up. They happily paid. This is an oversight? Can it be an oversight? Is it not because of the way FMSS was allowed to operate? Over-payment by more than $120,000 â just from one transaction. And what was the work done? Who knows?",
            "This particular case was exposed quite by chance. If not exposed, the money would not have been repaid. And when it came out, the Town Council says, \"Oh, sorry. We made a mistake.\" How did the mistake arise? How many other such mistakes which benefited FMSS? AGO was not asked to do a forensic audit. So, they did not check all the items. They only checked on the general processes. And even that, only for one year from 2012 to 2013. So, you cannot say, based on AGO audit, that no money was lost. And AGO had made that clear that you cannot say that.",
            "When you set up a system that is so flawed, of course, there are going to be serious issues. Let us put this in layman's terms. You have a business, with cash, valuables belonging to other people. You do not know what exactly you have. You put a friend in charge. They take what they want of the cash. You overpay them several million dollars. You do not check.",
            "Auditors say your accounts are in a mess, the accounts are unreliable. In fact, you say yourself that you cannot produce the accounts. Auditors say that you have no clear idea of what has happened to the cash. And you come and you say no money is lost. One can only wonder at such a statement.",
            "The law takes an extremely strict view on related party transactions when conflicts of interests are involved. The lawyers in this House will know that. When contracts have been entered into with related parties in breach of fiduciary duties â and let there be no doubt that there is a breach of fiduciary duties here by everyone â the law presumes loss. It will require the related party to justify every payment by showing what work was done and assessing the true value of the work. The contracts are all voidable.",
            "Given all of this, how can Ms Lim or anyone honestly say no money has been lost? And the money was not lost through accident. The structure was approved by at least some of the Town Councillors. For your party supporters to form a company and do all of this, this is not a question of negligence or inexperience. You do not need many years of experience to know that you should not let your friends do what they like with public funds.",
            "We will only get a full picture of what monies were lost if there was a forensic audit of the Town Council from May 2011 to January 2015. But you know what? It will be quite easy for the Town Council to find out how much money exactly FMSS and FMSI made. All you have to do is to ask them to produce their accounts and bank balances. How much were Ms How, Loh and Yeo paid? How much money did FMSS and FMSI make? Since FMSS is a private exempt company, its accounts are not public. And FMSI is a sole proprietorship. So, the rest of us here and the rest of Singapore will not know what they made. The basic point is that while the Town Council lost money, FMSS and FMSI made money. The Town Council can find out the answers. Will it do so?",
            "Mr Low said to this House that the Town Council had no choice but to appoint FMSS. He played the victim. No one else wanted to tender to be the Managing Agent for the Town Council because it is an Opposition ward. Lucky to have had Ms How to the rescue, he says, because she had some experience from Hougang.",
            "When the Workers' Party Members of Parliament took over the Town Council on 8 May 2011, there was an existing MA contract with CPG. This was due to expire only on 31 July 2013, two more years to go. And the contract was such that it could not be terminated by CPG. It could only be terminated by the Workers' Party.",
            "The Town Councils Act provides for continuity. There was no need to start from scratch. Ms Sylvia Lim says that CPG asked to be let go. Maybe so. But it was up to the Workers' Party whether they wanted to let CPG go. But you had already decided who you wanted. So, let us not pretend here. FMSS was set up on 15 May 2011, seven days after the General Election (GE). And you decided to replace CPG with FMSS. Ms Lim had said that discussions on termination started in the end of May. That was after you set up FMSS.",
            "Taking over was pre-meditated, to hand over the Managing Agent to the parties that you wanted to. So, stop playing the victim card. You said having Ms How was lucky for the Workers' Party, but I think one can conclude from the AGO report that it has not been so lucky for the residents, seeing how they had been short-changed. But of course, Ms How and FMSS have been very lucky. They made more than other Managing Agents. As I have said, where did the money go in the end? It will be interesting to find out.",
            "Let me now turn to the fourth issue: the responsibility of each of the Town Councillors for what has happened. Given this sorry state of affairs, it is now time for each Town Councillor to come clean before this Parliament and before the people of Singapore.",
            "Let me start with Mr Chen. Mr Chen has said that they will \"take a rational and responsible approach\" to Town Council management \"with the interests of the residents âhigh' on their minds.\" Mr Chen should tell us: did you know that Loh, Ms How and Yeo owned FMSS and FMSI? If you did, when did you know? Why was there no discussion at the Town Council of their ownership of these companies? And why is there no record in the minutes of any such discussions? Did you know that Loh, Ms How and Yeo were going to be allowed to supervise themselves and pay themselves as set out in Annex 1? Did you know of the process? Did you know that the amounts involved ran into millions of dollars? Over $6 million in just one year â FY2012/2013? Did you know that FMSS was being paid very high MA fees, much higher than anyone else? If you did not know the full facts, Mr Chen, then that is a partial excuse. Because I think if you had known all the facts, you could not have agreed to this structure â no one could reasonably have agreed to it. This cannot be approved, in law, by anyone acting honestly and with full knowledge of the facts. So, the question is: what did you know, and when did you know?",
            "I am reminded by Deputy Prime Minister Teo that you are the Chairman of the Finance and Investment Committee. Mr Chen, as a lawyer, you will know that every Town Councillor owes fiduciary duties and you know what fiduciary duties means. It will be a gross breach of those fiduciary duties to have allowed Loh, Ms How and Yeo to act as they did, and rubber stamp what they did. You will be aware that such conduct is unlawful. If a Town Councillor acts in breach of his fiduciary duties, then legal action can be brought up. The Town Councillor would have acted unlawfully.",
            "Mr Chen, now that all these details are out â what are you going to do? How are you going to explain to your residents?",
            "Let us turn to Mr Pritam Singh. You are a lawyer. You make fierce speeches about transparency. In May 2011, you said, \"My friends, the Workers' Party has one important rule that we abide by strictly â we will not play politics with the residents of Aljunied GRC by making empty promises to them. If there is one thread that runs through the Workers' Party manifesto, it is the thread of transparency and accountability\" â you thundered. You have been anything but transparent and accountable. There is a thread all right, but it weaves and leaves a tangled web. Would you tell us what your position is on each of these questions I have asked?",
            "Now, let us turn to Ms Sylvia Lim. You are the Chairperson, lawyer. You obviously must have known from the beginning that Loh, Ms How and Yeo owned FMSS and FMSI. And you approved the system that was set up. And you rubber stamped their actions by countersigning the cheques. You do not seem to have ensured that all relevant facts were made known to all the Town Councillors. No discussion on how the serious financial conflicts were going to be handled. No discussions on how residents' monies will be protected. Nothing.",
            "You must have known that such conduct would be in serious breach of your legal, fiduciary duties. That it will be unlawful to do so. Yet, you allowed this. And the Town Council also failed to give documents and information to your own auditors and to PwC. The inevitable question is: why did you do all of this?",
            "On 13 May 2013, Ms Lim, you made a speech in this Parliament. You said you are committed to being accountable to others for Town Council Management and you strongly defended FMSS, Loh and Ms How. That was the very month, May 2013, that you stopped submitting arrears data to MND. Your Town Council had submitted it every month until then.",
            "You also said that you had a \"team of dedicated professionals\" to run the Town Council. And you said, \"How did we get to this point? We have a team of dedicated professionals with Town Council experience, because for the past 20 years, you Hougang voters have supported us. Because of you, Singaporeans can now see they have a choice. They can see that it is not only the PAP that can run Town Councils\". And you said, \"MPs in Singapore manage Town Councils in HDB estates. Under the Town Councils Act, elected MPs are to manage and improve the common property in the town, which includes roofs, lifts and other common facilities. A large part of a town council's income comes from the residents, by way of S&CC or service & conservancy charges; town councils also receive Government grants, which are funded by taxpayers. Being custodians of public monies, MPs should use town council funds to advance the residents' interests and not for partisan advantage.\"",
            "You knew you were custodians of public monies. That is why FMSS and FMSI were allowed to freely transfer public funds to themselves?"

Will the Town Councillors do that?",

They did not manage the Sinking Fund; their data is unreliable; they have submitted reports with significant discrepancies; and it looks like they are not even able to monitor the overall state of what your residents pay you in S&CC fees; they do not perform bank reconciliation required by the TCFR; they do not properly control receipts and handling of cheques; accounting systems and procedures were inadequate; they do not check on amounts collected, paid out and receivables; their own auditors, Foo Kon Tan, heavily and seriously qualified the accounts for FY2011/2012 and FY2012/2013; and for FY2013/2014, no audited accounts have been submitted.

            "It is not just a matter of there having been a few lapses on some issues. So many things are so disastrously wrong. There has been a complete dereliction of duties. This is in addition to the gross breach of fiduciary duties in relation to FMSS and FMSI.",
            "You made a conscious decision to appoint your close supporters â Loh, Ms How and Yeo â to run the Town Council. You allowed the set-up which allowed monies to be paid to them, unlawfully. What does this say of your integrity?",
            "In conclusion, I say this to the AHPETC Town Councillors. Each of you appears to have seriously breached your fiduciary duties. On behalf of the residents of Aljunied GRC, more than 150,000 of them, hardworking, honest people, we have to ask the Workers' Party to come clean and explain yourselves to the public. Your residents deserve some real, honest answers. Thank you."

So, I would like the Minister to clarify that there has been no mistake in his chart, and it is really the fact that all these MAs are charging the same rates for commercial and residential units. From the data that I have, even the MA for PAP Town Councils such as CPG from the Aljunied Town Council's records that we have, their MA rates for commercial units was $12 and something.

First of all, I think was not in the Chamber when some of us made our speeches and it is a fact that some of the other Members of Parliament have yet to speak. So, if he is accusing us of not giving answers and all that, I think it is premature for him to say so.",

From this version of the FRS which I see, it is mentioned that parties are related so long as one entity provides key management personnel services to the reporting entity. Is it just related to business interests, or is it the case also that parties that provide key management to the reporting entity are considered related?",
            "Next, Madam, as far as the signing of cheques goes, I think the Minister was also not here, when we went through the Appendix, the list of 84 invoices, showing that steps have been taken to segregate the duties. He is trying to paint the picture that we have been operating lawlessly all this while, but I do not think that is a fact.",
            "Next, the Minister may not have noticed that when we looked through the award of the MA tender in 2012, we actually engaged an audit firm to do an audit of our process. What our auditors noted was the disclosures made by the MA to us at the time, including the fact that 80%-over of the MA fee was salary of the staff and revealing to us their cost structure and so on. On that basis, we were awarded an \"A\" during that audit, because of the way that tender was assessed. And yes, it is a case that the rate may be somewhat higher, but it is not what the Minister portrays in this Annex, which I think is not accurate.",

The fact is, as we have stated to the auditors, the ACRA company profiles were submitted for evaluation. So, that was disclosure on that aspect specifically.",
            "One last point for now: the Minister suggests that we deliberately got rid of the former Managing Agent CPG Facilities to appoint our friends. That is not the case at all. As we have said before, the request to be released came from CPG. In fact, their lawyers drafted the deed of mutual release. They explained to us why they needed to be released. We respected their decision because we need to work with the MA and we cannot have an MA that is reluctant to work with us.",

You may be misled because the previous Aljunied Town Council had differential rates but, today, those are the rates â if you look at the year that we have put. Now, if there is any change to be made to the Table, I will check overnight and I will let you know tomorrow.

Second, you throw at us that you have some audit firm which gave you the all-clear, would it not be good for you to produce that report and let me ask you these questions. The firm was tasked to review the MA tender and had a narrower scope compared with Pricewaterhouse. The review by that firm focused primarily on compliance with tender procedure. Were they asked to consider the substantive considerations behind the award of the contract? Did they actually sign off on the process that is outlined in Annex 1 and say: we agree. This is a wonderful process and you can go ahead with this â where the same person issues the invoice, certifies it and also signs the cheque? Did they approve that? Did they approve the process? So, let us be clear what they approved and rather than debating here â I think, why not you make a substantive statement? I will be surprised if you can produce any professional who is honest, who will say the processes that have been outlined in this House are supportable.",
            "You referred to the ACRA's statement. There is nothing on the record, and you look at my speech, there is nothing on the record that ACRA's statement was discussed at the Town Council meeting; it is not recorded in any minutes. But if you say that all the Town Councillors knew all the facts and yet proceeded on this basis, then, no doubt, you will explain to us why you chose to record some facts but not others; you chose to record that they were employees and directors but not owners. You will also then explain in due course at the right forum why you thought fit to approve this process, with full knowledge of facts. Thank you."

Some GPs have not participated in NEHR due to a variety of reasons, including concerns over the necessary changes in day-to-day work processes, the impact on operational cost, and unfamiliarity with IT. We will continue to engage with all user groups to address their concerns and make enhancements to NEHR to support the changing ways in which we deliver care.",
            "The Member also asked about Electronic Medical Records, which are detailed transactional records of a patient within a hospital. They allow the healthcare worker to enter clinical observations or assessments, order medication, make electronic orders for tests and review results and radiological images. For example medication given to the patient during a stay in hospital would be contained within their electronic medical records but not within the NEHR. In comparison, the NEHR is a non-transactional record of the patients' health journey that contains the summary record of each healthcare encounter. For example, when a patient is discharged from hospital, the medications prescribed to them as part of their ongoing care will be sent to the NEHR. The discharge summary is also sent to the NEHR to ensure that any other clinician is able to understand critical and relevant information in order to facilitate better ongoing care for the patient. Clinicians enter information once into their local EMR system and the relevant information is automatically extracted and sent to NEHR.",

This includes the development of the Continuity of Care Record (CCR) functionality which would provide a mechanism for institutions to share patientâs active problem list and care plan, with the end state being a seamless integration with hospital EMR systems. Future developments will also include the use of data analytics to support both decision making at the point of care and national planning for MOH.",

In the meantime, as our care model continues to evolve to meet emerging challenges and growing healthcare needs, we will need to constantly review our IT system.

The Government has been providing support and assistance to these SMEs, to help them improve productivity and enhance their competitiveness. This is done through three main schemes. The Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV) supports SMEs for consultancy and implementation of solutions in the areas of innovation, productivity, human resources and financial management. The Micro-Loan Programme (MLP) provides loan financing of up to $100,000 for micro-enterprises. The Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) is a tax incentive for investments in innovation and productivity improvements. About 20,000 micro-enterprises received assistance through these three schemes in 2012. In 2013 and 2014, the number increased to around 24,000 and 33,000 respectively.",

In 2012, MUIS collected $25.5 million and disbursed $25.8 million, resulting in a deficit of $0.3 million. In 2013, MUIS collected $28.4 million and disbursed $28.0 million, resulting in a surplus of $0.4 million.

This is the period when MUIS would have greater clarity on the zakat funds available for disbursement in the year. However, zakat financial assistance, disbursements, programmes and services under the eight asnafs, or categories in which zakat is disbursed, is spread throughout the year. This difference between when zakat is collected and disbursed means that there may be a slight excess or shortfall in any particular year. To ensure the continued funding of programmes under the zakat, MUIS sets aside a reserve to buffer against shortfalls and unforeseen situations which may affect collections and needs, such as an economic downturn."
