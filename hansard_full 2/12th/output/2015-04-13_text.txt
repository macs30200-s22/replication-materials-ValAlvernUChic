3
asked
the Prime Minister whether he will consider re-naming Singapore's airport after the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

asked
the Prime Minister whether Singapore currencies, both notes and coins, can bear the face of our founding father, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
5
asked
the Prime Minister whether he will consider printing the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew's photo on Singapore's dollar notes in honour of him.
:
Mdm Speaker, the Prime Minister will make a statement at the conclusion of the Question Time to address some issues in respect of Question Nos 1 to 5. Can I, therefore, request that these questions be deferred and left to his statement?
:
Yes, I agree. Mr Yee Jenn Jong, Question No 6.
asked
the Minister for Transport (a) whether Singapore-based airlines have a two-person cockpit rule or other systems to protect the cockpit; and (b) whether their pilots are required to be subjected to periodic psychological tests.
(for the Minister for Transport)
: Mdm Speaker, all Singapore-based airlines have implemented measures to ensure that there are at least two persons in the cockpit at all times. All pilots on Singapore-based airlines must annually undergo a medical assessment which includes an evaluation of the pilot's mental health. For pilots 60 years and older, the medical assessment is conducted every six months. These requirements are consistent with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.
In addition, CAAS regulations require pilots to declare any ill health at any time. Our airlines are also required to have procedures to enable a pilot to report on a fellow pilot whom in the former's opinion is not fit to fly. Pilots may submit confidential reports to the authorities or through their airlines' in-house reporting systems.
:
Thank you, Madam. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. First of all, condolences to those who have lost their loved ones at the recent Lufthansa Germanwings incident. I would like to confirm if this multi-layered cockpit security applies to all Singapore-based airlines, including the budget airlines? The next question I have is: how many years have these rules been in operation, both the two-men cockpit rule as well as the periodic psychological tests. Thank you.
:
Mdm Speaker, as I indicated in my earlier reply, this is a requirement that our Singapore airlines, on their own, have decided to implement. To the Member's question as how long this rule has been in effect, it differs from country to country. In the US, for example, the rule was instituted post 9-11; in Canada, Australia and Germany, the rule was introduced in response to the Germanwings incident. In our case, to the best of our knowledge, the airlines introduced it quite recently.
asked
the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the 0.8% decline in Singapore's labour productivity in 2014, whether the Ministry can provide an update on the programme outcomes of the three productivity centres that have received government funding.
(for the Minister for Trade and Industry)
: We have introduced an extensive range of schemes and grants to help companies upgrade their productivity. We also recognise that even if companies are ready and willing to improve productivity, some need help to diagnose productivity issues, implement productivity improvement projects, adopt new and relevant technology and identify the right schemes to support their productivity journey.
Assistance is available at different levels. The SME Centres, as a first stop for businesses, provide comprehensive basic advisory services. For more customised help, our Centres of Innovation provide help with technology and Intellectual Property translation, while Productivity Centres give productivity advice and consultancy. There are Productivity Centres to serve three key clusters. These are the Construction Productivity Centre (CPC) for Construction, the Singapore Innovation and Productivity Institute (SiPi) for Manufacturing, and the Singapore Productivity Centre (SPC) for Retail and Food Services.
To date, about 800 companies have benefitted from these services. Their productivity projects have delivered good results. Let me give an example: SYSPEX, an SME in the packaging business. It reduced its processing time by 20% and improved space utilisation by 30% after upgrading its warehouse infrastructure and systems. SiPi provided invaluable consultancy assistance for this project, while SPRING supported the project with the Capability Development Grant. In general, companies have seen 10% to 20% improvements in productivity metrics such as process cycle time, machine utilisation, and storage capacity after implementing projects with help from the Productivity Centres.
Apart from assisting companies, the Productivity Centres also organise conferences, workshops, seminars, and study trips. Through such events, companies can learn more about productivity techniques, technological developments and best practices in their sector. About 1,300 companies and 1,000 participants have benefitted from these so far.
The Productivity Centres have proven to be a valuable resource for our companies. We are therefore strengthening their capabilities further to better meet companies' needs and deepen productivity expertise in Singapore. Firstly, we are expanding the pool of productivity consultants, including those with specific industry expertise, such as in Retail or Food Services. Secondly, the Centres are conducting applied research and benchmarking studies, to gauge where we stand and how we can effectively address sector-specific productivity issues. Lastly, we will continue to monitor industry demand, and scale up our Productivity Centres to cover new sectors where required.
Through initiatives like the Productivity Centres, the Government continues to support our companies as we work towards achieving our long-term productivity target.
asked
the Minister for National Development (a) how many Built-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) applications under the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) have been made each year from 2011 to date; (b) how many of these applications each year have been successful; (c) what is the average number of unsuccessful applicants under MCPS per BTO and SBF exercise each year from 2011 to date; (d) what is the Ministry's plan to better help Singaporean couple applicants who wish to live near, and care for, their parents; and (e) whether the supply of flats is still meeting the expected demand for them.
: Madam, I am sorry but my reply will contain a string of statistics. The number of Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) applications under the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) was about 14,000 in 2011, 18,100 in 2012 and 15,700 in 2013. There were 8,400 such applications between January and September 2014. The selection exercises after September 2014 are still in progress.
The success rates averaged 59%. The number of successful applications was 7,500, 11,000, and 9,600 in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. For the first 9 months of 2014, 5,000 applications were successful. In particular, for BTO flats in non-mature estates, the proportion of successful MCPS applications increased from 67% in 2011 to 93% in 2014. So, it has become almost all successful.
The average number of unsuccessful MCPS applicants per BTO/SBF exercise has dropped from 724 applicants in 2011 to 578 applicants in 2014. For applications under BTO exercises, the average number of unsuccessful MCPS applicants has halved from 511 applicants in 2011 to 241 applicants last year.
We have offered more than 100,000 new BTO flats between 2011 and 2014. This has cleared the demand backlog for first-timers. Today, almost all young couples, including those who apply under the MCPS, are successful in their first application for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates. Last November, we also converted the MCPS to a quota-based priority scheme, to give even greater assurance to families who wish to stay near or together.
Besides the MCPS, we have the Higher-Tier CPF Housing Grant for resale flats to facilitate couples who wish to stay near or with their parents.
asked
the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the weight limit on the transport of gold and other precious metals in and out of Singapore by individual travellers; (b) whether diplomats are exempt from this limit, if any; (c) whether the Police is aware of a diplomat carrying up to 27 kg of gold bars in his luggage on a flight out of Changi Airport in March 2015; and (d) what measures are in place to ensure that diplomats do not abuse their diplomatic immunity to carry precious metals, drugs or weapons in and out of Singapore in their luggage.
(for the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs)
: Mdm Speaker, there is no weight limit on the amount of gold and other precious metals that can be transported in and out of Singapore by travellers. In line with the international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, our measures and controls are focused on the point of sale of such items in Singapore.
All precious stones and metal dealers (PSMDs) are required to conduct customer due diligence and file a Cash Transaction Report (CTR) with the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office when they sell any precious stone, precious metal or precious product to a customer in cash exceeding S$20,000. This is supplemented by the general suspicious transaction reporting (STR) regime, which requires all persons in Singapore to report any knowledge or reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct which comes to their attention in the course of business or employment.
Police is aware of media reports of a case last month where a person allegedly attempted to import gold into another country without making the proper customs declarations, after arriving on a flight originating from Singapore. Police records indicate that the person, who is a foreign diplomat, but not accredited to Singapore, did depart on a flight from Changi Airport where he was screened before boarding and no security threat items were found on him.
All diplomats, like other travellers, are screened for threat items before they are allowed on board an aircraft. This involves the use of metal detectors for person checks, and x-ray screening for their belongings. Although the personal baggage of diplomats are generally exempted from inspection under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR), a diplomat's personal baggage will be inspected if there are serious grounds for believing that he is carrying prohibited or controlled items, such as weapons and drugs.
: I thank the Second Minister for the reply. I have two supplementary questions: first, why was there no detection of the alleged items in his baggage, given that it was detected when he arrived in Bangladesh? The Second Minister said that no security threat items were discovered. I suppose this does not include gold. Would the diplomat have been allowed to transport that amount of gold, allegedly, through Changi Airport on that day?
Secondly, under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations, diplomatic bags carried by diplomats are protected from search and seizure. This means they need not pass through security screening. How does the Police ensure that this is not exploited as a security loophole for terrorists or trafficking activities? I am concerned about this because there is no limit to the size of the "dip bag" (diplomatic bag), and there have international incidents in the past where "dip bags" have been used to smuggle a variety of banned items, including drugs, weapons and even people.
: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. First, gold is not a security threat item, and that is why it was not subjected to a security threat screen. Our officers would conduct a normal security threat screen, and if items such as weapons or suspicious objects, or things like large amounts of cash are detected, then they tend to follow through on further checks, as required by the protocol. So, the Member should be clear that this is the context. There was no lapse in terms of security threat assessment and the checks that go with it, as part of the pre-boarding screening.
Secondly, the Member talks about diplomatic bags and I think he is getting a few things mixed up here. The "dip bags" are separate to the personal bags of diplomats. Diplomatic bags have a certain kind of treatment, but diplomats who are travelling and carrying personal bags are subject to pre-board screening, like all other travellers, as I have said. That is the protocol that is observed, not just in Singapore but internationally, because that is what is necessary to ensure safety in aviation and in travel.
: I thank the Second Minister for his replies. Two points: first, in response to his second point, I am aware that only the "dip bags" are excluded from screening. So, my question is: given that these bags are excluded from screening, would that pose a security threat or threat of smuggling of any other items.
On the first point about the gold, I acknowledged that it was not a security threat item. But would this amount of gold have been allowed to pass through if it was detected without being declared.
: Madam, on the first question, if there is suspicion or serious suspicion that there is a matter of security threat, then the police and the relevant agencies are not constrained from making the appropriate checks on the various items that may be carried by diplomats. It is an international protocol that we observe. So, any risk that the Member imputes to be associated with such practice is a risk that is internationally acknowledged as well. It is not peculiar to the Singapore regime.
Secondly, on the amount of gold and whether therefore it would have been allowed to pass, I want to reiterate first the point that we do not have any controls on the quantity of these precious metals, et cetera, that are being exported out of Singapore, and usually there are certain basic conditions that they observe when they do so. The Member should also be aware that it is not uncommon, especially for travellers to certain parts of the world to carry what you and I might consider not insignificant amounts of gold in their personal baggage. If they are able to give a clear explanation that these are their personal effects or for personal consumption purposes, generally they would be allowed to carry on with their travel with those items.
asked
the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs what are the conditions that the organiser of the cancelled Future Music Festival Asia 2015 could not meet in order to address the concerns of potential drug abuse at the event.
(for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)
: Mdm Speaker, the Future Music Festival Asia (FMFA) is a spin-off from the Future Music Festival (FMF) that was established in 2006 in Australia. The FMFA was launched in 2012 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and was staged there in 2013 and 2014.
At the FMF 2013 held in Sydney, more than 100 drug-related arrests were made. The same event held in Brisbane in 2014 saw over 200 drug-related arrests made. The March 2014 FMFA in KL had to be cancelled on its last day after six people died and 14 people were hospitalised due to drug abuse at the event. Two of those hospitalised were Singaporeans. This incident was widely reported in the media. Most recently, 107 concert-goers from the Sydney FMF 2015 in February are facing charges for possessing or supplying drugs at the event. Australian police seized 7,500 Ecstasy tablets believed to be bound for the Brisbane FMF 2015 in March. This was followed by over 50 drug-related arrests at the Melbourne leg of the event.
Given the track record of drug-related activities associated with past FMF and FMFA events, the Police had serious concerns with potential drug abuse at the proposed FMFA event to be held in Singapore. The Police and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) engaged the organisers on several occasions to assess their security plan for the event. However, the organisers were unable to assure the authorities that they could put in place adequate measures to prevent drug-related activities at the event.
Considering the repeated drug-related incidents, including deaths and serious illness, that had occurred at the FMFA and FMF events in KL and Australia respectively, it would have been irresponsible to allow it to be held in Singapore without adequate safeguards and assurances. The event would also not have been consistent with our zero-tolerance stance towards drugs. Therefore, the Police decided to reject the application for this event to be held in Singapore.
However, I note that the impact of the cancellation of the event by the organisers was made greater because they had gone ahead to advertise and market the event before they had obtained approval to carry it out.
Singapore has managed to keep drug abuse under control precisely because we have taken a firm stance, zero-tolerance, towards drug abuse. This approach should extend to any event that is to be held in Singapore, particularly one that is associated with a worrying track record of drug abuse. We want a reputation for Singapore to be a place with music festivals where people can enjoy themselves in a safe and trouble-free manner. We welcome music events that can provide such an environment. There are really many events held in Singapore which do not present such drug-related concerns. In fact, in the same week that the FMFA 2015 was supposed to be held in Singapore, there was a sold-out concert at the Sports Hub which attracted an audience of 30,000. This was larger than the estimated daily attendance for the proposed FMFA 2015.
I also note that the Australian media had reported on 2 April that the FMF group in Australia had announced that it will no longer be holding FMF events in future, citing financial viability as the reason. The media reports on the issue also mentioned the serious drug incidents that had repeatedly been associated with this event in Australia and Asia.
:
I would like to thank the new Second Minister for Home Affairs for his answer and the efforts to keep Singapore drug-free. I would like to ask the Minister whether such an assessment, based on the track record of the organiser of the festival, has been applied to other applicants for such events related to drug threats. The last question is: would the authority have recommended measures to the organisers to take such steps so that the threats of potential drug use are minimised or prevented?
: I thank the Member for the question. The track record of the event organiser was very clear. So many years, everywhere they have held it, there have always been incidents connected with drugs. And it would be remiss of the authority to ignore it altogether. Therefore, taking that into consideration and the fact that during the engagement with the organiser, they failed to show how they can actually prevent or put adequate measures to prevent the same incidents from happening in Singapore.
Imagine if this incident had taken place, and on the last day, like in Malaysia, death had occurred, and we had to cancel the event, what would our explanation be in Parliament today?
So, I hope Members will continue to support the Government's stand to ensure that our zero tolerance against drug abuse is consistent and holistic and prevent such incidents from happening in Singapore.
asked
the Minister for Manpower whether interest rates for CPF accounts will be revised upwards in line with rising interest rates and, if so, how will this be implemented.
: Mdm Speaker, the CPF interest rates are pegged to returns on investments of comparable risk and duration in the market. Hence, changes in the yields on market instruments, such as Singapore Government Bonds and fixed deposits, will automatically have an impact on CPF interest rates through the interest rate pegs.
The interest rates on the Ordinary Account, Special Account, and Medisave Account are reviewed quarterly, while the interest rate on the Retirement Account is reviewed on an annual basis. This ensures that the CPF interest rates remain sensitive to market conditions.
However – and it is important to highlight this – to shield members from the risk of low market interest rates, the Government has maintained a floor interest rate of 2.5%, or 3.5% for balances of up to $20,000, for the Ordinary Account and a floor interest rate of 4%, or 5% for balances of up to $60,000, for the Special, Medisave and Retirement Accounts (SMRA). These floor rates are considerably higher than the computed interest rates currently of about 0.2% for the OA and about 3.4% for the SMRA, based on the interest rate peg formula.
So, if market interest rates rise sufficiently, such that the interest rate pegs are above the floor interest rates, then the interest paid to members for the respective CPF accounts will be adjusted upwards accordingly.
:  Thank you, Madam. I thank the Minister for his answers. I have one supplementary question for the Minister. As the Minister has explained, currently the CPF pays a floor rate which is actually very attractive considering the current low interest rate scenario, thereby helping CPF members accumulate savings despite the low interest rate environment. So, I would like to ask the Minister, would the Government consider preserving that positive difference between the current floor rates that they are offering to CPF members as the interest rate changes?
Let me ask it again: whether CPF can consider a guaranteed premium rate over market interest rates to at least preserve the current positive differences? Currently, there is a floor rate that is offered. So, despite a very low interest rate offered in the market, there is a floor rate of 2.5% for Ordinary Account, and 4% for the Special Account. But as the interest rate increases, that gap, the positive difference that a CPF member enjoys, is likely to narrow if CPF rates are not adjusted accordingly.
So, what I am asking is whether the Minister would consider, given that the people are beginning to understand the attractive interest rates that members are getting on their CPF accounts, but it is a moving target, as things are now, market interest rates are also expected to go up. Would the Minister adjust the interest rates of CPF accounts in tandem with the market interest rates, so that CPF members can enjoy a guaranteed positive spread? Thank you.
:
Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary question. I am sure all of us will generally, if given a choice, prefer much higher interest rates. As I mentioned, we will review it regularly. It is important for us to do that. What is important is to make sure that the CPF system as a whole benefits. For example, the additional plus 1% that is provided under the SMRA account and, especially recently with the announcement that the first $30,000 at the age of 55 or 65 another additional 1%. All this is a sum total package. It is meant to keep the CPF system viable and to continue to make sure that it is adequate in terms of supporting our retirement adequacy. We look at it holistically. Reviewing the interest rates will be part of that whole process. That is something that we will continue to do.
asked
the Minister for National Development what are the criteria for selecting HDB blocks of flats for the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme.
: Madam, the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) allows optimisation of land use and revitalises such old estates through new developments. As the name suggests, the identification of suitable precincts for SERS is on a selective basis.
First, it will depend on the availability of suitable sites for rehousing the residents together. This is important for preserving community ties, and is especially valued by our senior citizens.
Second, it will depend on the economic viability of the project. This takes into account the potential for redevelopment and land optimisation of a precinct and also the cost of acquisition. The latter includes the market compensation for the flat and reasonable expenses to cover removal, stamp and legal fees. The Government also gives generous rehousing benefits and grants which include the option of purchasing a replacement flat at a subsidised price.
Third, it will depend on the availability of financial resources to fund the SERS programme.
: Thank you, Madam. May I ask the Minister two supplementary questions? I do have quite a number of flats that are more than 50 years old, so, whether the MND would consider taking a poll of residents in older flats of more than either 50 or 60 years old, to ascertain whether residents want their flats to be redeveloped on a en bloc basis; that means to take a poll of residents where they are staying in flats of more than 50 or 60 years old to see whether they want to have it redeveloped.
Second question is: would the Minister give an assurance that residents affected by SERS would definitely get priority in selecting another flat nearby their affected flats. I understand from Minister's earlier answer that the answer is "yes". I just wanted Minister to confirm.
:
Yes indeed, the answer is "yes". I try to give "yes" answers to most reasonable requests from Members of Parliament. As to the question "Can we carry out a poll among residents to decide whether we do a SERS or not", as I have explained, it must meet the three criteria, much of it is top down. It depends, for example, on viability. If the project is not viable, even if there is a bottom-up request for it, you cannot just finance it.
asked
the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry determines the number of childcare places needed while building new HDB precincts, and if so, how does the Ministry arrive at the size and number of the childcare centres for each new BTO project; and (b) whether the current planning parameters are sufficient.
(for the Minister for National Development)
: Madam, social communal facilities, such as childcare and eldercare centres in HDB precincts are planned for by the respective supervising agencies. Through upfront planning and close interagency coordination, HDB works with the various agencies to set aside space for these facilities, and to construct them in tandem with new public housing developments.
The number and size of childcare centres in each BTO project are determined by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), the supervising agency for childcare centres. They plan for the childcare centres based on the projected demand for childcare services in that particular area. ECDA regularly reviews the planning parameters to take into consideration changing demand for childcare services.
: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I am quite surprised to hear that it is determined by ECDA. From my various meetings with ECDA, they told me that it is determined by HDB and that is why I filed this question.
Based on the experience in Nee Soon South, so far we have six new BTOs. For every new BTO, we have a long queue for childcare centres and that is why I think the planning parameter, the number of childcare centres allowed for the places are insufficient. And I hope that whichever agencies that plan for childcare centres can review their planning parameters, so that the new BTO residents will not suffer.
:
Madam, we noted Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's concern for her residents in the new BTO flats. She is correct that there are BTOs in Nee Soon South. To date, I have checked that there are already 12 childcare centres in Nee Soon South Division. There are three BTO flat precincts that are already included with childcare centres. Three childcare centres are being constructed in three new BTO precincts which will be ready by the third and fourth quarters of 2015. There are six new BTOs sites in Nee Soon South, and each BTO site will have childcare centres provided. HDB will continue to work with ECDA to anticipate the demand. HDB will try its best to try to accommodate the needs of the residents in that area, following ECDA's assessment of the projected demand for the childcare places.
:
Minister of State, for your information, every new BTO of about 1,000 units, the childcare placing is about hundred over places and from the past experience, this is grossly insufficient. So, I would like Minister of State to help to work with ECDA, to change the planning parameter to allow for more childcare centres.
:
Madam, we will work with ECDA. ECDA is a supervising agency. As mentioned, HDB will try its best to accommodate requests from the supervising agency. HDB is not in a position to determine the actual number of places required, but if so requested by supervising agencies, like ECDA, and even MSF with regards to elderly facilities, HDB will try its best to provide those spaces available.
:
I would like to ask the Minister of State also whether HDB could work with ECDA, for those in-fill BTO projects to also consider demand from the existing neighbourhood because the existing facilities may not be suitable or conducive to build childcare or whatever community use purposes and therefore the new BTO precinct could possibly make up and compensate for the gap in the neighbourhood.
:
Madam, we certainly recognise the need for childcare centres. ECDA and MSF are working very hard to try to meet those demands and the needs of childcare places. We will continue to work with ECDA to look at the request made where there are already existing demands and to see whether existing BTOs can increase the supply to meet the existing demands of residents in the neighbourhood.
asked
the Minister for Transport (a) why is the requirement for carpark provisions for religious institutions the same regardless of their location, whether within the city centre or beyond; (b) whether the carpark requirement can be reduced if the institution is located within close proximity to MRT stations or large commercial complexes/institutions with ample carparks; and (c) whether this carpark requirement can be further reduced if these buildings are regarded as national monuments or to be conserved.
(for the Minister for Transport)
: Mdm Speaker, parking spill-overs from places of worship that occur during worship hours or religious festivals can cause significant inconvenience to surrounding neighbourhoods. We therefore require places of worship to provide within their premises, a certain number of parking places.
However, we do grant concessions in car parking standards for various categories of places of worship. Those located within the city centre can provide up to 20% less parking than the prescribed standards. Places of worship that are accorded monument status by the National Heritage Board or conservation status by the Urban Redevelopment Authority are exempt from providing any parking. We will study the Member's suggestion to reduce parking requirements for places of worship close to MRT stations.
asked
the Minister for Transport whether there are plans to extend bicycle crossings at traffic junctions to other parts of Singapore.
(for the Minister for Transport)
:
Madam, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has implemented 14 signalised bicycle crossings so far, and has firm plans to build a further 38, mostly in areas with existing cycling path networks. LTA is studying where else these crossings should be implemented and we welcome suggestions from Members.
asked
the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs from 2001 to 2014, what was (i) the number of foreign students who were offered and who had accepted permanent residency when they reached Secondary 1 or later; (ii) the number of such student PRs who had gone on to become citizens; and (iii) the number of such students who had renounced their PR or citizenship.
(for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)
:
Madam, between 2001 and 2014, around 7,000 foreign students at secondary and Junior College levels have been granted PR on their own merits. About 840 or 12% of these PRs have subsequently taken up citizenship. One percent of those granted PR have renounced PR, while none has renounced their citizenship.
: Thank you, Madam. I just have two questions. What is the desired intention of this scheme in giving PR to such young foreigners with no roots in Singapore versus giving them an option to work after their graduation, and if they are bonded, they will have to serve their bond obligation, anyway?
Question 2: is this scheme effective versus allowing foreign spouses of Singaporeans with Singaporean children or who have lived and worked here a long time, a fast track to getting their PR, since one half of their family nucleus is already deeply rooted here.
: Madam, I thank the Member for his questions. Let me take the second question first. There are many ways for individuals to secure PR in Singapore, including young people in the age groups that the Member has indicated. This scheme is just one of a range of possible routes. In fact, the large majority are associated with families because their parents are Singapore citizens or PRs themselves, or because their parents have applied for PR as a family together; and they have come together. So, I want to make it quite clear that the large majority of the PRs of this age group of foreigners is really through some of these other routes.
Secondly, what is the desired intention? Well, as we have stated before, it is part of a larger talent policy in Singapore, so we keep different routes and options available to us. The Member suggested this is a group that is too young to be considered. There is, in fact, an equally persuasive alternative view, because these young people, by virtue of being embedded in our education system for a significant period of time, living and studying cheek by jowl with Singaporean students, are better integrated, and therefore better able to immerse themselves in our environment.
So, the scheme is targeted, it is very measured in the way it is taken up. As I have given the statistics, the proportion who takes up PR and from there to citizenship is clear, the number who actually give up or renounce their PR is very, very low. I would say that overall, just to give the Member a sense, as a percentage of all the other PRs that we give, for students or young people, it is less than 5%.
asked
the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider reviewing and extending the Edusave Awards to full-time madrasah students.
(for the Minister for Education)
: Madam, Edusave was introduced to support the holistic development of students in MOE-funded schools.
We have recently extended Edusave Contributions to all Singaporeans aged seven to 16, even if they are not in an MOE-funded school, so that they too can receive support for secular enrichment activities.
Edusave Awards recognise secular academic and non-academic achievements in the context of MOE-funded schools. It would not be appropriate to extend the Edusave Awards to students in private schools, including those in the six full-time madrasahs that offer a total curriculum that comprises both compulsory religious and secular subjects.
Madrasah students do receive support. MUIS provides assistance for madrasah students from low income families. In particular, MUIS provides the PROMAS Performance Award to needy madrasah students who perform well in both their religious and secular subjects and exhibit exemplary character.
asked
the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the difference between the existing SPRING-administered SME Talent Programme and the newly introduced SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme.
(for the Minister for Trade and Industry)
: Mdm Speaker, SkillsFuture is a national initiative to provide Singaporeans with the opportunities to develop their fullest potential, regardless of their starting points. The new SkillsFuture Earn & Learn Programme (ELP) and SPRING's existing SME Talent Programme (STP) are complementary programmes that aim to develop our human capital, while at the same time address our companies' need for talent, thereby contributing to the larger goals of SkillsFuture.
The SkillsFuture ELP is a work-study programme that benefits fresh graduates from Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs) and Polytechnics to take on jobs in both SMEs and non-SMEs. The programme aims to encourage ITE and Polytechnic graduates to enter industries which they are trained for, by providing them with opportunities to earn an income and deepen their skills through a mix of institution-based and work-based training. They will progress after the programme through clearly-defined career development pathways.
The STP was launched by SPRING in June 2013, to build a strong pipeline of local talent for our SMEs. SPRING works with key Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to help SMEs reach out and recruit promising students from ITEs, Polytechnics and Universities. Participating SMEs can engage students through internship opportunities and study sponsorships. The students will work in the SMEs after their graduation. SPRING also provides assistance to SMEs participating in the STP to develop strong HR systems, to ensure that they offer good careers for the students who join their companies.
The SkillsFuture ELP is being implemented in phases, starting with a few sectors. As the SkillsFuture ELP and STP have different but complementary aims, SPRING and WDA have been working closely to harmonise these two programmes. Over time, the STP will scale down and ceased for sectors and job roles which roles have been covered by the SkillsFuture ELP.
asked
the Minister for Health whether the latest salary review for public sector doctors has succeeded in (i) stemming the flow of doctors from the public to private sector; and (ii) achieving a consistent remuneration structure across all restructured hospitals and clusters.
(for the Minister for Health)
: MOH plans the training of healthcare manpower in tandem with the development of healthcare infrastructure nationally, including that of the private sector. As doctors are generally trained within the public sector, some of them will eventually join the private sector. Our aim is to retain sufficient good doctors within the public healthcare sector to ensure that we can continue to deliver good quality care to Singaporeans. To achieve this, we not only need to pay our doctors in the public sector competitively, but also provide them with challenging career opportunities spanning clinical service, education, research and leadership.
MOH has worked with the public healthcare institutions to implement a new pay framework for doctors, in two phases in 2012 and 2014. The new pay framework provides better recognition of the important roles that public sector doctors play in the areas of clinical service, education, research and administration. Following the review, our public healthcare institutions are now more aligned in terms of principles and structures of doctors' remuneration while retaining some flexibility to manage individual packages for talent retention purposes.
Beyond pay, the public healthcare sector aims to offer our doctors a fulfilling career that allows them to manage more challenging clinical cases, teach and nurture future generations of doctors, undertake research to improve quality of care, and for some, the opportunities to take up leadership positions in their organisations. Many of these roles are unique to the public sector which the private sector does not typically offer. To support professional and personal growth, public sector doctors also benefit from opportunities for continuing training and development. At the same time, efforts have been undertaken by our public healthcare institutions to improve the work environment for doctors such as shorter rotating shifts, having protected time for structured learning and the adoption of IT to streamline and minimise administrative workload.
I am glad to inform the Member that with the recent changes, the rate of our doctors leaving the public sector has decreased, from 6.5% in 2011 to 5.8% in 2014. The number of doctors working in the public healthcare clusters has also grown by 34%, to close to 6,500 over the same period.
MOH will continue to review and enhance the value proposition of a public service career to attract and retain good doctors in the public sector.
asked
the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the number of families that have come under the Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE) scheme since its implementation in 2004; (b) what is the percentage of families under HOPE that have managed to keep their number of children at two; (c) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the profile of families that have broken the conditions of the scheme and their plight; and (d) whether the Ministry considers the HOPE scheme a success.
(for the Minister for Social and Family Development)
: Mdm Speaker, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) is deeply committed to supporting young and vulnerable families as they go through various life stages. To do this, we work with our partners on a range of programmes. For instance, at the point of marriage, we encourage the young couples to attend marriage preparation programmes to strengthen their marriage foundation. This is mandatory for civil marriages where one party is a minor below 18 years old, or where both parties are 18 to below 21 years old.
MSF is also rolling out a new programme called Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Programme (PREP) to help young couples tackle different challenges in their marriage. Through this course, they learn skills in communication and conflict management, and more about commitment as well as problem-solving. For young Muslim couples, the two INSPIRASI hubs dedicated for marriage preparation and enrichment offer programmes to help the couples adjust to their multiple roles towards their spouses, towards their parents-in-law and towards their children. They are also taught how to better manage their finances and work towards home ownership.
The HOPE scheme is another such programme to better support our young and vulnerable families. It is intended for lower income couples who wish to keep their family size small, with a view of improving themselves and achieving a better life for themselves as well as their children. Families under HOPE receive substantial support and financial assistance in housing, utilities and work training, as well as education bursaries and mentoring support.
Since 2004, more than 3,200 families have benefited from the HOPE scheme, and about 40% of 3,200 families have increased their household income. The employment rate of the mothers in the programme has increased from 30% to 60%. About 20% of the mothers have also upgraded themselves through various types of training.
Families under the HOPE scheme are free to choose to withdraw from the scheme and its benefits at any point in time. The majority - or maybe I should say this - nine in 10 HOPE families have remained on the programme since it was incepted in 2004. This means that only about one in 10 families have withdrawn from this scheme. For many of these cases – the Member had asked about the profile – out of this small group, about 39% indicated that they wish to have a third child. For some of these cases, it is also because their family circumstances have improved. The other 35% withdrew from support sessions, mentoring sessions or had separated. Despite their exit from the HOPE scheme, they are still able to tap on a wide range of social support programmes and channels as provided by the Government and community agencies to better support their family and their children.
:
I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. I just have one question: one of the eligibility criteria is for the applicant to stop after having two children, right? I just want to know from the Ministry what are the factors taken into consideration in coming up with the number two. Will the Ministry consider increasing the number as we are actually encouraging more Singaporeans to have more children? Thank you.
: I thank the Member for his supplementary question. Like I have mentioned earlier, there are a wide range of social support programmes to better support fellow Singaporeans and I highlighted the PREP scheme, and so on. And I said HOPE is another such programme to better support a certain group of young and vulnerable families who would like to keep their family size small. If you refer to our website, the key considerations, it is all put out there. There are various considerations like age of the families, age of the spouses, combined household income, employment status, and so on. Family planning is just one of the considerations.
I have also cited earlier that the families can choose to withdraw from the HOPE scheme as and when they wish to, as and when their families' circumstances have changed and improved. For example, if families would like to have a third child, this is where we will work with them to transit them to other social support programmes to ensure that there is a smooth transition.
asked
the Minister for Education whether the Government will impose a requirement for all autonomous universities receiving Government funding to ensure that (i) eligible Singaporeans are given priority for academic employment; and (ii) all human resource departments in these autonomous universities to be headed by a Singaporean to ensure that eligible Singaporeans are given due consideration for employment.
(for the Minister for Education)
: It is important that our Autonomous Universities (AUs) recruit academic staff based on merit, to ensure that they hire the best talent able to deliver high quality education and conduct research that will benefit our students and Singapore.
All eligible Singaporeans are considered carefully, and processes are in place to ensure that hiring is non-discriminatory. Applications for academic positions are put through multiple approval layers involving selection committees, Academic Heads of Department and Faculty Deans, before final approval by top management. Senior appointments must be approved by the Presidents or Boards of Trustees.
The Government and our AUs are keenly aware of the need to develop local talent. This is why the Minister recently launched the new Singapore Academic and Research Talent Scheme to encourage more young Singaporeans to pursue an academic career. At the undergraduate level, a MOE-AU undergraduate scholarship has been launched for those who have keen interest and strong aptitude for a career in academia. Under this scholarship, recipients will be paired with NUS, NTU or SMU, and benefit from academic mentorship throughout and beyond his undergraduate studies. The student will then be expected to apply for a postgraduate scholarship from our AUs, for PhD studies and post-doctoral stints. These postgraduate scholarships will be co-funded 50-50 by MOE and the AUs. This comprehensive developmental programme is only available to Singaporeans and is intended to prepare each individual for an academic career.
Under the Singapore Academic and Research Talent Scheme, we will grow the number of existing postgraduate scholarships for Singaporeans who are interested to do research and teach at our AUs. We intend to offer over 1,500 scholarships at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, over the next 15 years.
Additionally, our AUs also actively try to reach out and recruit Singaporean academics based overseas.
: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I just wanted to ask the Senior Minister of State, I think the banks say the same thing when they talk about wanting the best talent. Hence, we have a lot of foreign employees in the banks, resulting in a lot of unhappiness. May I ask the Senior Minister of State, considering that university lecturers have huge influence on the minds of our many young undergraduates, would it not be better for us to constantly emphasise in employing more Singaporean professors or lecturers, so that they can emphasise Singapore values to our young undergraduates.
Next is, MOM has the tripartite guidelines on fair employment practices with a view of strengthening the Singapore core. Would that not similarly apply to academic places for universities because I really feel that we should emphasise employing or giving the best opportunities to Singaporeans to get academic appointments in the universities.
The third question is whether MOE tracks the number of university professors or lecturers who have gone overseas to lecture. As a result, basically, that is a loss of talent from Singapore to other overseas universities.
: Mdm Speaker, I think we are certainly in agreement that we do want to have a very strong core of Singapore academic talent. That is not just because of the influence that they will have on young minds, but also because it is important for our own research and development and our own academic pipeline, that we should have Singaporeans who are well-versed in the different areas of academia. The real question, I think, is how we should achieve that.
Mr Lim's questions had really suggested two things: that the HR director must be Singaporean and that you stipulate that for funding, you must consider eligible Singaporeans. In a sense, when you are dealing with policy, policy has to be broad. We cannot micro-manage it. We are in agreement with the overall objective, which is that you should have a strong Singapore core in academia. How to achieve it? Most of the universities actually do, in fact, have HR directors who are Singaporeans. Two of them have had HR directors who are Singaporeans for the last 10 years. Another two, the newer ones, SUTD and SIT, have had from the time of inception to present HR directors who are Singaporeans. One university has had a HR director who is a PR. But the point is that there is still this issue that is being discussed.
You can see that recruitment is a matter not just of the HR director but at different levels. It is not a simple process; there are many layers to it. To the extent that choosing the right talent involves a degree of assessment of the candidates' knowledge, their background, their personality – that is something we can leave to the universities. But if the concern is to make sure that we do have a good local talent pool, that message has gone out clearly to the AUs and that is something that we are working towards. Hence, the scheme that I mentioned earlier.
Also, when we talk about eligibility, the question is how you define "eligibility". Let us just say in the context of law, for example, you could have three or four people who are eligible in the sense that they all have a background in various types of international law. But if somebody who is not Singaporean also happens to have worked in the UN, and also happens to have extensive international experience, that may be of benefit to our students to have somebody of that background.
You can see that at the edges, there is some element of discretion that is necessary. We would prefer not to put in tools which make it too much like a quota, as it were. The overall and overriding objective is to make sure that we have a strong talent pool, and to make sure that Singaporeans are given a fair opportunity to enter academia, continue in academia and do well in it. That, we are in agreement on and that message has been made clear to the AUs.

Mr Lim Biow Chuan.
:
Madam, thank you for your indulgence. I just wanted to follow up with Senior Minister of State. I read recently in the newspapers of 3 March this year, that NUS Yale had hired 70 academic staff, of whom only 14 are Singapore citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents (SPRs). To me, that is really a disproportionate number of lecturers. I know NUS Yale is not an autonomous university, but surely there is something that we can do to ensure that students who enlist in universities based locally are taught by a majority of Singapore lecturers, instead of a large number of foreign lecturers. Otherwise, we will just lose our Singaporean identity after a while.
:
As the Member has pointed out, Yale-NUS College is not an AU. It is still at an early inception stage. So, we will monitor it, and we will track and see how it develops.
asked
the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry has completed its study of the suggestion on compensation for commuters affected by train and bus service disruptions and, if so, what are the conclusions.
: Mdm Speaker, today, when there is a prolonged train service disruption, commuters exiting the affected stations will have their fares waived or refunded. Free bus bridging services and free boarding of public buses at the affected stations are also provided. For bus service disruptions, affected commuters are given a fare refund and a complimentary bus ticket for a future ride.
We assess that for now, the current arrangements are appropriate. Our arrangements are similar to that for the London Tube, where only fare refunds are given. Some other cities provide additional compensation but only for prolonged disruptions. For example, the Hong Kong MTR provides a little more compensation in the form of a 10% discount for a same-day second trip when the disruption lasts for more than half an hour. The difficulty really is that it is not a straightforward exercise to identify who should be eligible if we want a comprehensive regime where we compensate all affected commuters, as this may have to include commuters who detoured using alternative routes as well as those who had to forgo their journey altogether.
We will focus efforts on further improving train and bus reliability. This way, we minimise the inconvenience experienced by commuters in the first place.
:
Mr Lim Biow Chuan.
:
Thank you, Madam, again. I think the Minister is fully aware that each time there is a train disruption, commuters who are affected are unhappy and they are not really appeased by the amount of fine that is imposed on the public transport operators (PTOs). The question really is for the Ministry of Transport to think of what else can it do to appease the unhappiness that commuters face. I want to ask whether the Minister could consider implementing a form of compensation to these affected commuters. There must be ways of outlining who are the affected commuters and really, from that sense, their perspective, it would help make them happier if not less discontented. Ultimately, fines do not go back to them and they feel that, well, so what if the PTOs are fined? I want a compensation for my loss of time, for the fact that I got to take a taxi to work or rush somewhere. So, really, it is a matter of giving them a fair settlement because of the disruption. And I think the PTO should bear that cost.
: Mdm Speaker, I can certainly understand where the Member is coming from. It is a subject that we look at from time to time. The difficulty we face so far is that there are different degrees of inconvenience caused to different groups of commuters. There are those in a very, very severe disruption who may have to de-train, get down to the track and walk to the station. There are those who are stuck on affected trains. There are those who may be able, even though their trains are affected, to drop off at an interchange station and find their way around, and they are also inconvenienced because the journey is longer even though they can continue to complete the rest of the journey on another train. The difficulty is to find a framework that is fair to all these different parties. Much as we have given thought to it over the last year or so, we have not been able to come up with something that we think applies fairly across to all commuters who are affected.
We look at the MTR practice in Hong Kong. It is for same-day compensation of a 10% discount on a second trip. And if the disruption takes place in the late evening peak hour, for example, then it is a compensation that may not make as much sense as it would, if it had happened in the morning. Even when we look at these different examples, there is no perfect solution that we think is applicable to our case.
Yes, I agree with the Member that the fines may not go directly to those commuters who are most affected. But the fines help, in a sense that it goes towards the Public Transport Fund, and out of the Public Transport Fund, we provide support to those who need it most, meaning the lower-income who are affected every time we have a fare adjustment. This is why we have been able, over the last two fare exercises, to put up to about $7.5 million each time in terms of vouchers to the lower-income families, and this in part comes out from the fines that are paid by the operators into the Public Transport Fund.
:
Mr Lim Biow Chuan.
:
Thank you, again, Madam, for your indulgence. Perhaps, I can just boldly make a suggestion to ask the Ministry of Transport to think out of the box. Let us say we compensate every commuter who has popped in to an MRT station, give them $5 credit into their MRT card, as a form of compensation. The compensation fund helps the lower-income and commuters who are affected may not benefit from that. So, let us think about giving them a compensation of $5, $3, whatever amount it is. Compensate them so that they can feel that, well, I am adequately compensated for the inconvenience caused to me for disrupting my journey. Would the Ministry of Transport consider that?
:
I think the Ministry of Transport is open to suggestions. The difficulty is whether commuters who are inconvenienced to different degrees would accept that – an equal compensation applies to all of them regardless of the extent to which they been inconvenienced. And I think that is the difficulty.

Mr Yee Jenn Jong.
asked
the Prime Minister whether the Ministry is working with banks to improve SMEs' access to foreign exchange hedging products, including renminbi hedging.
(for the Prime Minister)
: Mdm Speaker, I am taking this Question on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).
Madam, banks in Singapore offer companies, including SMEs, a comprehensive range of foreign exchange solutions. These include foreign exchange forwards, swaps and options against various currencies, including the reminbi (RMB). These hedging solutions are offered for transaction sizes as small as $10,000, which should cater to the needs of most Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs can also choose to hedge their Asian currency risks through the many currency futures contracts listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX).
To reach out to the SMEs, several banks have organised workshops on the use of these foreign exchange (FX) hedging tools. Besides the banks, SGX and the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) has organised seminars on the use of FX futures to hedge risk. SPRING also provides toolkits and grants to help SMEs upgrade their capabilities in financial management or improve financial knowledge. To reach out to more SMEs, SPRING is intensifying its outreach efforts through a network of 12 SME centres. MAS, on its part, will continue to ensure that the finance industry meets the needs of our SME sector.
:
I thank the Minister for the reply. Just a supplementary question. I would like to check if our Government agencies have conducted studies on how our Singapore's hedging product market compares to those in other countries and also especially on the usage by our companies. Have studies been conducted to see whether, for example, our SMEs are using this appropriately and sufficiently?
: Madam, I can speak from the perspective of the MAS because we engage the banks and the finance sector, and I would say that the banks are seeing greater demand for foreign exchange services and solutions from the SMEs. Because our SMEs are growing and there are also more of them are going overseas, they are earning international revenue and, therefore, they have more foreign exchange exposure. And so, if you talk to the banks, all of them are indeed expanding their suite of solutions and services to meet their small business customers, particularly with regard to managing foreign exchange transactions and risks.
However, I would also say that when we look at the assessment from the financial sector's point of view, a lot of the gap is really in terms of the knowledge and the in-house skills within the SMEs. It is not so much the lack of services but the issue of a lack of knowledge and in-house skills within the SMEs, and that means really going out to reach out to the SMEs, providing more courses or helping them to understand how to even quantify their FX exposure to begin with, and then helping them to understand what are the different options out there in order for them to hedge their foreign exchange risks, whether it is through a bank solution, whether it is through a futures contract, or for that matter, through a natural hedge, because you do it in a low-cost manner through a natural hedge by holding a basket of foreign exchange currencies. There are different solutions and I think that is the biggest gap that I think we need to address. As I have said earlier, there are many agencies – SPRING, ASME as well as the banks and SGX – offering different workshops and courses to SMEs to help them raise their awareness level.
asked
the Minister for National Development (a) whether AVA's real-time monitoring and early warning systems are effective in alerting fish farmers ahead of time of the occurrence of harmful algal blooms to prevent massive fish kills; (b) whether there is a need to relocate fish farms away from areas prone to algal blooms; and (c) whether persistent algal blooms have made it difficult for Singapore to achieve its target of 15% of fish supply to be from local sources.
(for the Minister for National Development)
: Madam, AVA monitors a few indicators of water quality, such as plankton count and dissolved oxygen, at our coastal fish farming areas. This allows AVA to give farmers early warning when adverse conditions are detected, so that they can take the necessary precautionary measures.
AVA was able to alert the fish farmers of the impending plankton bloom well ahead of time. For example, in the recent incident, AVA first alerted fish farmers to adverse weather conditions on 30 January, and advised them to monitor their fish stocks. On 16 and 17 February, as soon as AVA detected elevated plankton levels at the East Johor Straits (EJS), they alerted the fish farmers and advised them to deploy canvas bags or transfer their fish stock to unaffected areas. Those who heeded AVA's advice averted the worst of the fish kills.
We are studying the causes of plankton blooms in the Johor Straits more comprehensively, to give us a better sense of whether the plankton blooms are simply ad-hoc events or regular occurrences. It is premature to determine whether there is a need for fish farmers to relocate away from the Johor Straits, and whether plankton blooms will significantly hinder us from reaching our 15% local fish production target.
In the meantime, farmers should take steps to minimise the impact should another plankton bloom occur. AVA will help farmers to develop contingency plans. Fish farmers must also modernise their farming methods so that they are better protected. They can tap on AVA's Agriculture Productivity Fund to enhance their resilience. By working hand in hand, we will be able to minimise the impact of plankton blooms.
:
I thank the Minister of State for the reply. In view of the frequent occurrences of algal blooms in the past and it has become almost an annual affair, are there studies to also see if it is perhaps due to the reclamation works or other projects affecting the environment either by Singapore or by our immediate neighbours? And could the Johor Straits be not so conducive because algal blooms tend to happen in those areas and maybe, perhaps, the flow of the water may not be so good. Also, on the target to achieve the 15%, we are still quite a distance from this. So, are we confident we can achieve this target and by when?
: I thank the Member for the supplementary question. It is really not clear whether the on-going reclamation works in Malaysia have an impact on the fish death. But what we are doing now is following last year's plankton bloom episode, AVA has been working with the Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI) of NUS on a research project to conduct studies on plankton blooms, to enable development of effective mitigating solutions. Studies are on-going and expected to conclude by 2017.
In addition, AVA has also called for proposals for the design and development of closed containment aquaculture system for coastal fish farming last year. AVA recently awarded the tender to five companies to develop a more sustainable sea-based farming system under the co-innovation partnership programme. The companies will be working on systems that offer a sustainable option for coastal fish farms to minimise exposure to environmental changes such as the plankton bloom.
On the question of how far we are from the 15% mark, we are working with all the fish farmers. We encourage them to modernise and look at various options, including the closed containment system and looking at the possibility of high-rise fish farming methodologies. We have been going to various countries to study various options available, with farmers coming along to look at the various options. We are working very hard to meet those targets.
As far as dealing with the current plankton bloom situation is concerned – we have had two, last year and this year – we continue to monitor the situation with the studies being done with TMSI, and we hope to be able to help our farmers mitigate. In a recent incident, for example, farmers who adhered to the early warning signs were able to minimise the fish kills by introducing the canvas bags which actually managed to save much of their fish stocks.
asked
the Minister for National Development (a) how many HDB flat owners have been allowed to opt out of the Home Protection Scheme (HPS); (b) whether the Ministry will make it compulsory for flat buyers to sign up for the Home Protection Scheme (HPS); (c) whether flat owners who are not covered by the HPS are allowed to sign up for HPS if they are still servicing a housing loan; and (d) whether HDB will make another effort to emphasise the importance of HPS to all flat owners who are still paying for their housing loan.
(for the Minister for National Development)
: Madam, HDB flat owners who use CPF to service their housing loans must take up HPS. They are only allowed to opt out of the HPS if they have taken up a similar mortgage reducing insurance (MRI). Forty-three thousand, six hundred and ten flat owners have been allowed to opt out of HPS on this basis.
Flat owners who are not using their CPF to service their housing loans may have to set aside cash to pay for their HPS premiums, if they do not have enough in their CPF to do so. As their financial circumstances may vary, HPS is currently not compulsory for those who do not use CPF to service their housing loan. Nonetheless, they can sign up for HPS on an opt-in basis, subject to underwriting and health condition at the time of the application. One hundred and forty-two thousand, three hundred and sixty-six such HDB flat owners have done so. We will need to carefully study whether to make it compulsory for all home buyers servicing a loan to take up HPS or similar MRI.
HDB actively encourages all HDB flat owners servicing a housing loan to take up HPS, as it ensures that surviving flat members are protected in the event of the death or incapacitation of the lessee. At the point of flat purchase, HDB will explain to flat buyers the benefits and the coverage of HPS. HPS booklets are also distributed to home buyers at HDB. We will continue to work with CPF Board to see how we can further improve coverage and awareness of the importance of HPS to flat owners who are still paying for their housing loan but who may not have HPS coverage.
:
Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Recently, when I attended the wake of a resident of mine who had passed away, I found out the flat is still not fully paid up and they have school-going-age children. And I asked the wife whether it was covered by HPS, the wife said, "No." That is why I am asking HDB, if they are still paying the flat using CPF, can we make it compulsory for them to have HPS? The reason is that in order to get out, they may go and buy an equivalent insurance but in subsequent years they may not renew the insurance. I would like to ask the Minister of State to consider this.
:
Madam, certainly we are looking at this area and will take on board the Member's suggestion.
(Punggol East)
:
Thank you, Madam. I would like to find out what are current efforts taken to remind home owners to make premium payments if they had failed to do so, before the policy is terminated.
:
Madam, HPS owners who do not have enough in their CPF Ordinary Account savings for HPS premium deduction are given a grace period of two months to make their premium payment. I believe that is where the Member is coming from. Any fresh Ordinary Account contributions received in these two months are reserved for HPS premiums to ensure that there is no lapse. During the two months' grace period, two notification letters – one in each month – will be sent to remind members to top up their Ordinary Accounts for HPS payments. If they do not pay their outstanding premiums within the two-month period, their HPS cover will lapse and a notification letter sent to inform them of this lapse in coverage and to alert them to the need to look into this. For members who are still using CPF to service their monthly instalments, the HPS coverage status will be indicated clearly in their annual CPF statements.
asked
the Minister for National Development when will plans to develop Hougang Town Centre under the Remaking Our Heartland programme announced in 2011 be released given that the projected timeline for the development site to be launched is three years.
(for the Minister for National Development)
:
Madam, HDB is currently working with the relevant agencies on the infrastructural and technical requirements for this land parcel at the Hougang Town Centre. The plan is for a mixed use development, integrated with the existing MRT station and bus interchange. Because of the complexity in this integrated development, agencies will need more time to resolve various technical issues before the site can be launched for tender.
:
Thank you, Madam. Just two questions. Is there any indication on when roughly the plan will be up? And the second question is, what is the standard timeframe between announcement of ROH and implementation? Because I understand three areas were announced in 2011 and I think the other two areas have made progress already.
: Madam, I want to assure the Member that progress is being made and the ROH for Hougang is not limited to the Town Centre alone. There are various aspects which are currently on-going.
With regard to the question on other sites, the context of each site is actually very different. Therefore, the plans for every town have to be customised according to the specific needs and requirements for the town.
The site in Hougang Town Centre, specifically asked by the Member, where the existing Hougang MRT station is, it will house, as I have mentioned earlier, an integrated development comprising many different users such as residential space, commercial retail space, bus interchange and the town plaza. Given the scale and complexity of the project and site constraints, the various Government agencies involved have to work on a detailed planning of facilities to be provided. Many stakeholders are involved and the interests of the residents have to be carefully considered at the same time. Agencies' plans and timeliness also have to be coordinated. In addition, the requirements of the tender have to be well co-ordinated in order to ensure that the development enhances the existing Hougang Town Centre to best serve the residents of Hougang.
I want to reaffirm the point that it is not that the ROH is not moving. There are other aspects of the proposals that are currently on-going. It is just that the Town Centre requires a lot more work in terms of planning and the complexity of the project requires more time for the different agencies.
asked
the Minister for National Development (a) whether the revision to the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment requiring 1.5 metres of minimum clearance along common corridors applies to buildings built before 1 April 2014; (b) if so, whether there are plans to align SCDF guidelines with this; and (c) if not, whether Town Councils will need to have two sets of by-laws for flats built before and after 1 April 2014.
: Madam, to prepare for an ageing population and to provide wider access routes for people using mobility aids such as wheelchairs and walking frames, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) revised the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment in 2013 to require a minimum corridor width of 1.5 metres for all residential buildings. This applies to new buildings and existing buildings undergoing major retrofitting works, with plans submitted for regulatory approval on or after 1 April 2014.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force's (SCDF) guidelines, on the other hand, stipulate that there must be a clear passage of at least 1.2 metres along the corridors, so as not to impede fire-fighting and rescue operations. SCDF also does not allow the storage of combustible materials along the corridors.
Town Councils (TCs) have a duty to keep the corridors free from obstructions and comply with both BCA's accessibility requirements and SCDF's guidelines. There is no need for two sets of by-laws as TCs can exercise their discretion in the wording of the by-laws to meet the prevailing requirements and guidelines.
Residents can also do their part in removing corridor clutter to ensure that passages are clear for a safe and pleasant living environment for all.
asked
the Minister for Education in light of the 2011 National Sports Participation Survey which shows a drop in sports participation rates from 67% in 2005 to 50% in 2011 for the 20-24 year old age group (a) what efforts have been made to reverse the drop in sports participation rates among students in tertiary institutions; and (b) whether there are dipstick figures to show more recent trends.
(for the Minister for Education)
: Madam, the Ministry of Education adopts a holistic approach towards physical and sports education throughout the education system. At the pre-tertiary level, Physical Education (PE) lessons are designed to help students develop strong fundamental motor skills, expose them to a wide variety of sports or physical activities and equip them with knowledge to design their own fitness programme. With access to sports facilities and recreational games, students have the opportunity to enjoy and live a healthy lifestyle, building a foundation to pursue these activities beyond their years in school.
At the tertiary level, our post-secondary education institutions (PSEIs) continue to provide an environment which supports sports participation. At most of the polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) colleges, students participate in compulsory sports and wellness modules. The Sports for Life programme at Singapore Polytechnic (SP), for example, allows first-year students to participate in a sport of their choice with options ranging from common sports such as swimming and tennis, to more novel ones such as laser tag and martial arts. Beyond the first year, students can continue to take elective modules to further their sports journey. The larger universities, NUS and NTU, also offer sports modules – some of which are credit-bearing – to their students.
Outside of the formal curriculum, mass participation events and competitive inter- and intra-institution games build a sporting culture at the PSEIs, and provide convenient opportunities for students to be involved in sports, regardless of their level of proficiency. The NUS Sports Club, for example, organises "SunNUS", a popular annual beach sports event that brings together students, staff, alumni and the public for a day of sports on Sentosa's beaches. The barrier to entry is low and caters to those looking for recreational sports. Those seeking more competitive sports can also participate in inter-faculty games at the PSEIs, or the annual inter-institution games, including the Singapore Universities Games (SUNiG), the Inter-Varsity Polytechnic Games (IVP) as well as the Polytechnic-Institute of Technical Education (POL-ITE) Games. These programmes and activities are often free, if not heavily subsidised, to ensure that the cost of sports participation is kept as low as possible. Students also have access to a wide range of facilities at the PSEIs to pursue sports at their own time and in line with their own interests.
Not all within the 20 to 24 age group are enrolled in our IHLs. Many are already in the workplace, and Minister Lawrence Wong in January this year outlined the efforts that MCCY is making to encourage sports participation among this group, as well as among the public. These efforts by our IHLs and MCCY are contributing to reversing the trend of declining sports participation among those in this age group. The Member will be pleased to hear that dipstick figures taken between 2012 and 2014 have reflected an increase in the sports participation rates for this age group to about 70%.
While this trend is encouraging, sports participation should be for life, and should not stop once students leave our PSEIs. To encourage active and healthy living beyond students' tertiary education years, our PSEIs also conduct sports and health-related education programmes. For example, NTU has a Healthy Lifestyle Unit that organises health education and healthy lifestyle activities. At the polytechnics, RP's Health and Fitness module equips students with strategies to maintain a healthy lifestyle. These efforts lay the foundation for our students to engage in sports and lead healthy lives throughout their adult years.
: Order. End of Question Time. Ministerial Statement, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
[
Pursuant to Standing Order No. 22(3) Written Answers to Question Nos. 29-31 on the Order Paper are reproduced in the Appendix.
]
: Mdm Speaker, during the month of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's final illness, and the week of National Mourning after he passed away, Singaporeans experienced a tremendous outpouring of emotions – gratitude, sorrow, and solidarity. People prayed for, grieved over and paid their last respects to the founding father who had done so much to create today's Singapore. Many wrote touching messages in condolence books and cards, and made special tribute books and items. During the Special Session of Parliament, Members spoke movingly about Mr Lee's contributions, what he meant to them, and their personal experiences of him. I thank this House, and all Singaporeans, for their tributes to my father.
Those of us who lived through this special moment in our history, and experienced this sense of togetherness in our shared grief, will remember it for the rest of our lives. Mr Lee's passing brought us closer together as one people and intensified our sense of nationhood. It was his last gift to us.
How should we remember and honour him – his person, his contributions, his ideals? Members of the House and the public have made many suggestions. There were several questions on the Order Paper today. Ms Foo Mee Har and Dr Lily Neo suggested printing his image on our currency notes and coins; Mr Ang Wei Nang and Dr Lily Neo suggested re-naming Changi Airport after him; and Ms Foo Mee Har suggested designating a day to commemorate our founding fathers every year. And there are many more suggestions.
These are all good ideas. But we should not rush into making decisions on this matter, especially so soon after Mr Lee has passed away. We should allow some time to pass, consider the ideas carefully, and make calm, considered decisions which will stand the test of time. We want to honour Mr Lee, but we must do so in the right way.
Most importantly, how we honour Mr Lee must be faithful to the ideals he lived by and fought for. Mr Lee made it very clear throughout his life that he did not need and did not want any monument. It was not monuments but ideals that were his chief concern; the ideals upon which he built Singapore: multi-racialism, equality, meritocracy, integrity, and the rule of law. He hoped these ideals would endure in Singapore beyond him. We can pay no greater tribute to him than to uphold the principles upon which he built this country.
Mr Lee was very careful when it came to lending his name to institutions and awards. When he consented, it was for causes that he was passionate about and where using his name served a greater purpose. He was intent on showing his support for the cause or institution, rather than using the honour to glorify himself. For example, on his 80th birthday, he agreed that NUS should create a Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Cabinet had discussed this carefully and had convinced him that having such a school, and associating his name with it, would help establish the Singapore brand of governance and advance the school's mission – to raise standards of governance in Asia, to improve the lives of people and to contribute to the transformation of the region. For the same reason, he supported NTU when it named its school of international studies after his old comrade, Mr S Rajaratnam, and the SAF when it named the command and staff college after Dr Goh Keng Swee. Similarly, the Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize honours contributions towards solving the world's water challenges, because water, in the Singapore context, was a lifelong obsession of his. And the various education awards in his name are to encourage students at all levels and of all abilities to strive for all round excellence. One of his recent contributions to education for awards was the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism and this focusses on Mother Tongue learning. He paid close attention to this issue all his life, not just as a policy matter, but as someone who learnt Mandarin the hard way as an adult and kept up the effort till his last days.
Mr Lee was very careful never to allow a personality cult to grow around him, much less to encourage one himself. He was exceptional in this respect among post-colonial leaders and founders of countries. They were larger-than-life figures, and often developed personality cults around themselves, especially if they lasted long in office.
Hence, you will not find portraits or busts of Mr Lee Kuan Yew all over Singapore. He did have his portrait painted and his bust made in his lifetime, but he did not allow them to be displayed publicly and I know of only two exceptions to this. After he stepped down from Cabinet in 2011, a bust of him, which had been made many years ago in the early 1980s by Sydney Harpley, who is a British sculptor and who did the Girl on a Swing and other sculptures which are in the Botanic Gardens, was displayed in Parliament House. There is another bust of Mr Lee, made by French sculptor Nacera Kainou, which is displayed at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities in the Singapore University of Technology and Design, with his permission. This was presented by the Lyon-Singapore Association as a gift to Singapore in 2013, as a token of friendship between the French and Singaporean peoples.
So, it is with this mindsetthat we should assess proposals to honour Mr Lee.
Ms Foo Mee Har and Dr Lily Neo suggested issuing notes and coins that bear the image of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew and that is certainly something we can consider for the future.
However, this year being SG50, MAS intends to issue a set of commemorative notes and coins to celebrate our heritage and reflect the spirit of Singapore. The notes and coins were planned last year, and had already been designed before Mr Lee passed away.
The set of coins, which are themed "Education, Building our Nation Together", was launched by Minister Heng Swee Keat on 4 April – last week.
The set of notes, comprising five $10 notes and one $50 note, will capture significant achievements in our history, and the values and aspirations that underpin Singapore's progress. On the $50 note, one element in the design will be a transparent panel showing Mr Lee with fist raised, leading the crowd with the rallying cry of "Merdeka!"
We had, in fact, settled this last year, and the notes are in production. We had hoped that Mr Lee would launch the commemorative set of notes himself. Sadly, that is not to be. But we have decided to continue with the project and will launch the notes later this year. They will form part of our SG50 celebrations, which will honour our founders even as we pledge ourselves to continue their work.
There have also been calls to turn Mr Lee's home, 38 Oxley Road, into a museum and a memorial to him. But Mr Lee was adamant that 38 Oxley Road should be demolished after his passing. He wrote formally to the Cabinet at least twice to put his wishes on the record – once soon after my mother his wife had died, and the second time soon after he had stepped down from office in 2011. He said, talking about Oxley Road, that "it should not be kept as a kind of relic". He said that he had seen too many other houses of famous people "kept frozen in time … as a monument with people tramping in and out". They invariably "become shabby", in his words. My mother also felt strongly about this. She was most distressed at the thought of people coming through her private spaces after she and my father had passed away, to see how they had lived.
Mr Lee stated his view on this matter inone of his books,
Hard Truths
. This caused a public reaction, as some people wanted the house preserved. So, in December 2011, after he had retired from the Cabinet, and after he had written to us the second time, I held a special Cabinet meeting and invited Mr Lee to attend, in order to discuss 38 Oxley Road.
The Ministers tried hard to change his mind. After the meeting, Mr Lee wrote to the Cabinet, and I quote from his letter:
"Cabinet members were unanimous that 38 Oxley Road should not be demolished as I wanted. I have reflected on this and decided that if 38 Oxley Road is to be preserved, it needs to have its foundations reinforced and the whole building refurbished. It must then be let out for people to live in. An empty building will soon decline and decay." End of the quote and that was the letter.
Two years later, in December 2013, Mr Lee made his will. He appointed my brother Mr Lee Hsien Yang and sister Dr Lee Wei Ling as his executors and trustees. Mr Lee wrote, in paragraph 7 of his will, and I quote:
"I further declare that it is my wish, and the wish of my late wife, KWA GEOK CHOO, that our house at 38 Oxley Road, Singapore 238629 (‘the House') be demolished immediately after my death or, if my daughter, Wei Ling, would prefer to continue living in the original house, immediately after she moves out of the House. I would ask each of my children to ensure our wishes with respect to the demolition of the House be carried out. If our children are unable to demolish the House as a result of any changes in the law, rules or regulations binding them, it is my wish that the House never be opened to others except my children, their families and descendants. My view on this has been made public before and remains unchanged. My statement of wishes in this paragraph 7 may be publicly disclosed notwithstanding that the rest of my Will is private."
Mr Lee's position on 38 Oxley Road was unwavering over the years, and fully consistent with his lifelong values. We should respect his wishes, as well as those of Mrs Lee.
Dr Lee Wei Ling has informed me that she intends to continue living in the house at 38 Oxley Road. Therefore, there is no immediate issue of demolition of the house, and no need for the Government to make any decision now.
If and when Dr Lee Wei Ling no longer lives in the house, Mr Lee has stated his wishes as to what then should be done. At that point, speaking as a son, I would like to see these wishes carried out. However, it will be up to the Government of the day to consider the matter.
There have been several calls to do something to honour not just one man, but our founding generation of leaders. For example, Ms Foo Mee Har suggested that we designate a Founder's Day.
Mr Lee was always conscious that he did not act alone, but as a member of a team. His core team included Goh Keng Swee, S Rajaratnam, Othman Wok, Hon Sui Sen, Lim Kim San, amongst others. It was a multi-racial team who complemented one another's strengths, trusted one another implicitly, and through their joint efforts created a prosperous, fair and just society in Singapore. Mr Lee himself said he was only
primus inter pares
– first among equals. So, it is appropriate that we consider how to honour not just Mr Lee, but also our other founding fathers.
One idea that has been suggested is to have a memorial for all of the founding fathers, perhaps coupled with an exhibition gallery to honour their legacy and educate future generations. Indeed, Mr Lee himself had thought that there was value in such a memorial.
I agree that this concept merits further consideration. A Founders' Memorial need not be a grand structure, but it must stand for our ideals, our values, our hopes and aspirations. It must belong to all Singaporeans and mean something significant to us all. It should be a place where we and future generations can remember a key period in our history, reflect on the ideals of our founding fathers, and pledge to continue their work of nation building.
I have therefore asked Mr Lee Tzu Yang to chair a Committee to gather views from the public, and conceptualise such a memorial for our founding fathers. He has agreed to do so. If the idea of a Founders' Memorial finds resonance among Singaporeans, the Committee will take the project further.
When I met Mr Lee Tzu Yang last week, he shared that in the week of National Mourning, he like many others was moved by the sense of solidarity. Everyone grieved together, and in our grief, looked out for one another – in the queues for the Lying-in-State, and along the streets as people bade farewell to Mr Lee in the rain. With time, our grief will subside, but our unity should remain. If the memorial captured some of that same spirit, we will have succeeded.
I agreed with Mr Lee Tzu Yang. Let us focus our attention and energies on how best to achieve this, especially given Mr Lee's longstanding views, and the wishes he expressed in his will.
Mr Lee lived his life for Singapore, not for himself. Let us take time to consider the best way to honour his memory, in a way that is in keeping with his ideals.
In remembering the past, we must also look to the future. Whatever memorial we decide upon should not only be right for Singaporeans living today, but also for generations not yet born. The memorial should reflect and strengthen in all of us our sense of what it means to be a Singaporean, why Singapore is worth striving and fighting for, and how we can continue to build a harmonious and successful Singapore for future generations. Thank you, Mdm Speaker .
: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Just a supplementary question. I agree with the Prime Minister on taking time and doing this properly. I would like to also reiterate the point that Mr Lee was a giant among the pioneer leaders, and I would not be wrong to say that he was much loved and respected by many. Throughout his life, he had touched so many lives and communities. People from all walks of life feel connected to him, and at many different levels and ways.
So, I would like to ask the Prime Minister when we do honour to his life, how do we ensure inclusivity where all groups and communities can connect and relate to, when we are honouring him and al the pioneer leaders and founding fathers.
: Mdm Speaker, that is a very important question, and that is why we are taking some time over the matter. It is not a matter of just having the right place or the right structure, but also a process by which we can involve people in discussing what is the best way to honour him, how can we develop this idea, conceptualise this idea of some sort of memorial for the founders which is more than just a memorial and have people feel that this is something which is right for Singapore and the right way to do it.
And then, after that, we find the correct place and then we make the right design. Also, if we are going to have a gallery, information and education, the right activities, so that everybody feels that this is part of our common heritage. Every country, as it develops its history, needs to develop these icons, these sacred memories and sacred places. We are early in the process. We are starting.
: Mdm Speaker, may I seek clarifications on the two questions I have posed in the Order Paper today?
:
Yes, if it is related to the MinisterialStatement.
: Yes. May I ask the Prime Minister whether he will consider favourably the request by many Singaporeans to name our airport after Mr Lee Kuan Yew? Was it not Mr Lee Kuan Yew who decided to relinquish Paya Lebar Airport and to change to Changi in the mid-1970s in spite of the consultants at that time not recommending it, and in spite of a reluctant Cabinet because of the cost of relocating plus a loss of the $800-million investment already put into Paya Lebar Airport? Does the naming of this remind generations to come, Mr Lee's always forward-looking vision plus the good value of bearing short-term pain for long-term gain?
I also like to ask the Prime Minister whether he is in agreement that a strong Singapore currency associated with a successful Singapore is a legacy attributable to our first Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew who built a successful nation based on what he said earlier, meritocracy, multiracialism, incorruptibility and a fair and just society. Thus, by having his picture on our currency notes, it will remind present and future generations on his important fundamental principles that have worked for us as we handle the notes each day.
: Mdm Speaker, as I try to explain in my statement, I think these are all sensible proposals. But I hesitate to make decisions on them now. It is two weeks since the state funeral and three weeks since Mr Lee passed away. I think we need some time to pass, we need to have some overall sense of perspective and history, and then there is time enough for us to make these commitments and decisions to honour him, not just in the next few months but really in the next few decades.
If you look at how other countries do it, when they have people who have made a big mark in their history pass away, you will have in their home town, perhaps, straightaway, a street is named after you. But on a national basis, a memorial may be 50 years later, may be 70 years, may be several generations later. And then your position, your historical place is clear and emerges, perhaps, in sharper focus. If we are only going to do one thing, what is it which we want to do, and then we do that.
So, I think we will give it some time. Mr Lee had got a lot to do with Changi Airport. He had a lot to do with our having a currency which is worth the paper on which it is printed. He had a lot to do with many other things, too – the Singapore River, the greening of Singapore. If we want to name things after him, there is no shortage of things which are suitable. I would say, let us take our time. Let us focus, in the first instance, on this idea of how should we remember our founders, not just Mr Lee, but the core founding fathers of the country. That, in itself, is a major exercise.
I think we should do that, and then over the years, there will be anniversaries, there will be birthdays, there will be 100th birthdays. We would come back to this, and we would look at it again. At that point, I am sure these ideas of Dr Neo and others would still be there and, perhaps, by then, we would be a bit more ready to say, yes, we go.
: Mdm Speaker, if I can ask in Malay?
:
Prime Minister, Sir, what role can be played by the minority community, like the Malays, in the efforts to remember the deeds and contributions of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew as well as the other pioneer leaders, towards the development of our society and nation, so that the future generations of young people will be able to learn from their sacrifices for Singapore?
: Madam, multi-racialism was one of the most important fundamentals on which Singapore was built. And in fact, multi-racialism was the reason why Singapore became Singapore as an independent republic. Therefore, I was very moved, during the period of National Mourning, that many minority Singaporeans expressed in the newspapers and wrote to me to say how grateful they were that they were born in Singapore, and not as a minority somewhere else. And how in Singapore, they had seen equal opportunities and they have had full chance to develop and their careers had in no way been hindered and they stand tall like everybody else.
I think that is the most important legacy which Mr Lee left towards multi-racialism, and one of the most important for Singapore. For minority Singaporeans, really, the way to honour Mr Lee is not to have a minority celebration, but a joint effort to participate fully in the national effort to do what we are trying to do. And remember, as we are not canonising a person; we are honouring a human being.
This is SG50, and there are many activities which have been planned. I am very happy that a Malay community organisation is taking the lead to organise a commemoration for SG50, I think it is going to be on 8 August, and has involved other community organisations from the Chinese, from the Indians, from the Eurasians, to do it together as one. That is the sort of activities and the spirit in which I hope that minorities as well as the majority of Singaporeans will honour and remember Mr Lee.
: Thank you, Mdm Speaker, for allowing me to seek clarification on this very important, sensitive and emotional topic. Many Singaporeans have many suggestions on how to honour the late Mr Lee. For Singapore who has gone through the National Mourning period, there is something very special and dear to remember. But the next few generations of Singapore will not have the chance to see the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew in action. We hope that Mr Lee Tzu Yang's Committee can consider a few options so that they can engage Singaporeans to see their preference on how to honour the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
As for the 38 Oxley Road house, we respect the wish of the late Mr Lee, but at the same time, we also understand the sentiments of many Singaporeans. So, I would like to ask the Government to consider digitising the images of the Oxley Road home so that Singaporeans can do a virtual tour of the house or part of the house to understand the frugality of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
: Mdm Speaker,these are things which we can consider.
: Mdm Speaker, we should be very proud that we have a founding leader who did not want or need monuments to himself or encourage a personality cult. We should honour that. Madam, I have two points. One is on 38 Oxley Road. Personally, I feel that we should respect Mr Lee's wishes to demolish his house. Once, I personally approached him on the topic and I remember what he told me – that he believes that we should not allow sentiment to get in the way of progress.
But given the significance of the house, especially the basement of the house, where more than 50 years ago, a group of people gathered frequently to discuss the formation of a mass-based left-wing political party and their struggle for Singapore's self-autonomy and subsequent Independence from British rule, I wonder whether there is a case to be made for a greater effort to preserve its heritage value for future generations, while respecting his wishes to demolish the house.
I support the call by the hon Member Mr Ang Wei Neng to document the house using paper, photographs, films and digital media formats. And perhaps the furniture in the basement can be considered as historical artefacts, which can be donated to the museum for a replica of the basement to be put up.
My second point is a wider one. It is on the Committee that is being set up under Mr Lee Tzu Yang. I support the proposal, but its remit seems to be rather narrow, focused in the Founders' Memorial. As there has been a great movement towards wanting to preserve our memories and the past for future generations, can I ask the Prime Minister whether he could widen the remit to consider the various proposals put up by the public and also to involve curators, historians and heritage specialists? As the Prime Minister said, there needs to be a detachment of time but also a detachment of emotion in going through all the proposals and deciding which ones should be kept, with a clear view that this is for the future generations.
: Well, Mdm Speaker, if we go on what Mr Lee has said publicly, I think in the
Hard Truths
book, he said, "Whatever you want to do after I am gone, take pictures if you like, then demolish the building". That is on the record; his will follows that. We have to go in accordance with his wishes.
I think that, in fact, the building has been documented. So, it is not that there is no information about the building; and photographs have also been taken and published, especially of the dining room where the important meetings took place.
On Mr Lee Tzu Yang's Committee, I think we have to focus the Committee because we are not able to decide now on comprehensively how we want to honour Mr Lee; neither is that Committee able to do so. We have to let time pass; we have to let perspectives emerge gradually over the years and decades. What we can do is to focus on one possible promising direction, which is a Founders' Memorial and an education gallery somehow linked it, perhaps co-located, but anyway linked to it. And how do we conceptualise that so that it is something which is meaningful and which achieves our future-oriented purpose. I think that, itself, is a very big task. To go around adjudicating as to which other things you want to do, would be hard to achieve.
Even for the Founders' Memorial itself, it would be necessary and very helpful to involve historians, people who have worked and lived in Singapore, ordinary Singaporeans, people who have expertise, who have seen how such memorial ideas are developed and gradually brought to reality and fruition over many years.
It is a very difficult process. You look at the 9/11 Memorial. It is now 13 and something years now since 9/11. The memorial is done but there were tremendous argumentations, disagreement, bitterness and battles along the way before they built it this way. Some people, including some significant sections of the families of the victims are very unhappy with the way it was done and the outcome.
If we look at the way people honour presidents, whether George Washington or Eisenhower or Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), from the time the person stopped being President or died, to the time when you do it, it may be – in Eisenhower's case, he died in 1969 and they are just arguing over his memorial now, they have not finished the dispute. In the case of FDR, he died in 1945. The memorial was built in the 1990s, so it was about 50 years before it was built. Even then, there was also controversy: should he been seen in a wheelchair or not; why is it you are ashamed of his polio? Because attitudes had changed in that 50 years.
I think that for us to think we can settle this within the next few months or few years, that is being presumptuous. If we tried to do that, we would make decisions which even if we did not regret, our children would regret. And I do not think we should do that.
: Thank you, Madam. I want to thank the Prime Minister and the other hon Members who have spoken.
Whilst I am not against the idea of having memorials, I also do question the use of spending so much time debating on the issue of memorials. We are not short of memorials in Singapore. We have got Kranji; we have got the Civil War Memorial; we have got the Tan Kim Seng Memorial. We have got memorials everywhere but how much of it has actually impacted the way we think and carry out our duties as Singaporeans? How much of it has really impacted the way we live our lives as Singaporeans and our Singaporean identity?
The Prime Minister and other speakers have spoken about how Mr Lee had his ideals and wanted us to carry on those ideals, and that the best way for us to honour his memory and that of our founding fathers would be to carry on those ideals.
I thought would be a more important question is how are we going to ensure those ideals are shared and imbibed by all Singaporeans, and are carried on through the generations so that we will always be proud to say that we are Singaporeans, so that we always say we believe in those ideals?
We can have a memorial, but after a while people would look at the memorial and say, "Oh, yeah, he did something for Singapore". But it is the ideals and values that are so important to make sure that we continue to thrive and be strong as a nation.
Perhaps, also we might want to think about how our children can be educated. Instead of just being told about certain days to remember, but exactly what a difference those days made to us and how we can make that difference too, and how children in schools can be taught those ideas and they can imbibe that and it becomes a part of the Singaporean psyche. But to do that we also need to have our educators who believe in that. How do we ensure that our teachers believe in that, our principals believe in that? How do we ensure that our civil servants believe in that? Do we all do that or are we just here to do a job?
I thought that maybe as Singaporeans that is what we want to be thinking about as well that as we reflect on the solidarity that we have shown, thankfully, for that, and, yet, something that we should not take for granted because it is something that we must develop and entrench within the way we think and the way that we live our lives. So, I urge the Government to think about how we can help our citizens, particularly our children, to remember all these things. Thank you.
: I agree fully with Ms Chia Yong Yong on her very sensible views. Indeed, it is the ideals and the way we live our lives which is much more important than any physical thing you build.
And, yet, it is helpful to have what you might call a local habitation in a form for those abstract ideals to focus our minds to generate the emotion and to bond people. Everybody has that. The Israelis have Masada. Every recruit goes there; he is presented his rifle there; he remembers an event 2,000 years ago relevant to their spirit today. If you go to other countries, for instance, in Britain, you go to Parliament Square, you have got Winston Churchill's statue there; Trafalgar Square you have got Nelson's statue over there. If you go to Washington on the National Mall, it is a pilgrimage not a tourist visit, especially if you visit the Vietnam War Memorial or the Second World War Memorial which I just visited last year. It focusses your mind and brings people together. So, too, with our week of National Mourning and the state funeral service. It is a form, but it meant something to the participants, it left an indelible mark and it changed them.
We had, by chance, a choir comes through Singapore – St John's College, Cambridge – and because of the Cambridge connection, they offered to sing at the Lying-in-State downstairs. They came, and they did a beautiful rendition of "Home". It was such a success that we decided we would ask other school choirs and other performing groups, including Jeremy Monteiro and his group, to come and perform during the Lying-in-State. It was a tremendous success – not just for the people who came to pay respects, but for the people who came to sing. And as one of the school children said, "It is not the performance, it is a tribute."
So, you will need these symbols, these physical things, but what are they which are full of meaning and not empty, and that is what we are looking for.
Education is an important part of this. After the National Mourning period, we are rethinking how we can do the National Education content in the schools so that you try to get some of the same impact otherwise I can write the best textbooks in world but between the textbook and the presenter and the listener or not very hard listener, each stage there is attrition, evolution, dilution. Eventually, you get an empty message rather than something substantial. And, yet, if we can have one really powerful experience and it is emotional as much as it is intellectual, then I think it will bring people together. That is in the schools.
On TV, we have had one week of old footage broadcasts. It took many years to assemble all that material. First to create that material – living it. Secondly, to gather it altogether, organise it and present it. And I think it had a big impact. At another time, it might have had not quite so much but at that moment it reminded people what all these was about. We need to do more of that during this SG50 year and beyond, not in a big gush of overhauling information, but a continuing trickle just to remember ourselves, where we come from and what we should be committing ourselves to. And I think that way we will be able to achieve our bigger objectives.

The Housing and Development Act, enacted in 1960, empowers HDB to carry out its duty to build good, affordable public housing and provide a safe and pleasant living environment for Singaporeans.
The Act may be 55 years old, but we have amended it from time to time. The last time we did so was in 2012 and it is timely to update the Act, to enable HDB to better meet residents' needs and address emerging challenges. In particular, this Bill empowers HDB to better tackle misuse of HDB property, especially when it involves public health and safety concerns to residents.
Madam, let me now highlight the key aspects of this Bill.
Clause 3 of the Bill introduces two new powers that will allow HDB officers to enter a flat to investigate whether any urgent work or repair is required, and if so, to carry out this work. The first, under new section 26A, permits entry with a warrant obtained from the court. The second, under new section 26B, permits entry without need for a court warrant, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is an imminent danger from within the flat which would affect public health or public safety. Let me explain the purpose of these amendments.
HDB inspects its buildings regularly to ensure that they are safe and in good condition. Homeowners also play an important role in ensuring the safety of their own flats. Sometimes, homeowners, because of ignorance or carelessness, do things that may endanger themselves and their neighbours. For example, they may unknowingly demolish an important structural wall.
With your permission, Madam, may I display a few slides on the LED screen?
:
Yes, please.
: Thank you, Madam. In June 2013, a Bishan homeowner and his friend removed part of a structural column while renovating the flat, as you can see it on the LED screen. The owner did not even apply for a renovation permit from HDB. Had he done so, HDB would have told him right away that he could not demolish the structural column because it was critical to the structural integrity of the building. Fortunately, a concerned resident alerted HDB about this. HDB engineers rushed in to prop up the affected beams, and worked throughout the night to reinstate the column. The home owner was prosecuted in court, convicted and fined. His reckless act may have endangered an entire block of residents.
Just a few months later, in Simei, a renovation contractor demolished part of the prefabricated Reinforced Concrete or RC walls by creating three openings. You can see, I think, two of them here [
referring to the slides on the LED screen
]. This is strictly not allowed, because the RC walls serve as supporting structures of the building. Again, HDB engineers had to rush in to carry out urgent repair works. The contractor was prosecuted, convicted and fined. In both cases, fortunately, the owners had the good sense to allow HDB officers to enter their flats to conduct emergency repair. Had the owners refused entry, for whatever reason, HDB could have been caught in a legal grey zone, and many residents would have been placed in unnecessary danger.
In such situations, it is imperative for HDB to be able to intervene, and intervene quickly. They must be able to investigate and rectify the situation without delay. New section 26B will give HDB the power to enter the flat for such repair works without the need to apply for a warrant. Members will agree with me that imposing a statutory requirement for HDB to only enter the flat with a court warrant will lose precious hours, when there is severe risk to life and property.
Let me now explain the need for section 26A, which gives HDB power to enter a flat, with a court warrant, for urgent repair works. This will help to address cases, for example, where ceiling leaks have become serious and urgent, which can be a source of distress and frustration or potential danger for some HDB residents if not resolved quickly.
Currently, when HDB receives feedback from residents on ceiling leaks, HDB will help them seek their upper-floor neighbours' cooperation to investigate and to repair the leak, if they have not already done so. HDB also helps to carry out the investigations to identify the cause of the leaks, on a goodwill basis. Most upper-floor neighbours are mindful of the inconvenience that their lower-floor neighbours face, and will agree to the repairs once they are told of this. To facilitate repairs and early resolution of the leak, HDB has implemented a Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) Scheme to assist lessees to repair the ceiling leak and to co-pay 50% of the cost of repairing the leak. While the GRA Scheme has helped many flat owners resolve leak problems effectively and at a subsidised cost, HDB has encountered some upper-floor neighbours who refuse to co-operate and delay the repair unnecessarily. Over the last four years, on an average per year, one in four cases takes more than four months to resolve.
For such cases, HDB will engage the upper-floor neighbours a number of times to seek their cooperation to carry out the repairs. Grassroots leaders may also be asked to step in to persuade them to cooperate. If all these efforts fail, HDB will have no choice then but to take legal action and apply for a Court Order to compel the upper-floor neighbours to carry out the repairs within a specified period. From 2012 to 2014, HDB took legal action against 400 households, after it exhausted all efforts to engage and persuade the upper-floor neighbours to cooperate. But this process of reaching resolution is protracted and can take up to 12 months. In the meantime, the delay could cause the leak to worsen and spread or result in severe spalling concrete, inconveniencing and, in some cases, even endangering the safety of the lower-floor neighbours. We hear of many cases of residents who are frustrated and who hope that HDB can do more to help them.
Let me cite two actual cases to give Members a sense of the circumstances where we envisage section 26A may be used. In the first case, in Yishun, the ceilings in the master bedroom toilet and kitchen toilet were leaking so badly and for such a long time that stalactites had started to form in the toilets. You can see it on the right [
referring to the slides on the LED screen
].The leaks had also resulted in spalling concrete on the ceiling where the reinforcement bars had been exposed. Imagine the inconvenience and anxiety of the lower-floor residents. Should the spalling concrete deteriorate further, loose chunks of concrete, small, large, could fall and hurt the occupants. The case remains unresolved since it was reported to HDB in June 2012, and HDB is still trying to resolve this.
In the second case, this time in Bukit Batok, the leak from the kitchen ceiling was so severe that the lower-floor residents had to perpetually place pails in the kitchen to collect the water. Similar to the Yishun case, stalactites had formed on the kitchen ceiling. What started as ceiling leak in the kitchen, because it was not resolved, had also spread to other walls in the living room. For these two cases, HDB and the local grassroots leaders had tried tirelessly to help these residents by persuading the upper-floor neighbours to cooperate, but were met with limited success. It took almost two years for this case to be resolved.
The proposed power of entry with a warrant will allow HDB to better help those suffering from serious ceiling leaks, among other things. Prior to HDB's application for a court warrant for entry, HDB will give the relevant unit 24-hours' notice at least. Should they still refuse to cooperate, HDB may then apply to court for a warrant to enter the flat to investigate the leak and carry out repairs.
We are mindful that the proposed powers to enter a flat without the owner's permission can be perceived as a drastic measure. Let me assure this House that HDB will only do so as a last resort, after exhausting all other avenues to get the owner's cooperation. HDB will use these powers sparingly, and judiciously.
These powers will also be balanced with proper safeguards. The Bill mandates that only officers authorised by the Board are empowered to enter the flat to investigate and to carry out repair. The officers will be required to show proof of identity to the lessees or occupiers. There will be at least one HDB officer present in the flat during the investigation and repair work, and the officer will be required to show proof of identity to the owners or occupiers of the flat.
Madam, let me now turn to clause 4 of the Bill.
From time to time, some HDB homeowners will hire contractors to renovate their flats to suit their lifestyles, tastes and preferences. To ensure that these renovation contractors do not unintentionally, in the course of their work, damage the block or compromise the structural integrity of the building, HDB has in place, since 1975, a Registered Renovation Contractors' (RRC) Scheme to regulate renovation works carried out by renovation contractors in HDB flats. Flat owners who wish to renovate their flats must engage RRCs, who are qualified contractors and should be familiar with HDB's requirements for carrying out renovations. To complement the RRC Scheme, HDB has also put in place a demerit point system and they could also be debarred from carrying out future renovation works in HDB flats.
For more serious cases, HDB will bring the errant parties to court. In 2006, HDB further enacted Rules to govern how renovations should be carried out in HDB flats. Renovation contractors, including those not registered under the RRC Scheme, as well as flat owners would be held accountable for breaches to these Rules. If convicted in court, they face a fine of up to $5,000.
While the absolute number of unauthorised renovation works remains small, we observe a gradual increase. In 2014, there were five cases of major structural infringements, compared to three cases in 2005. Overall, for the 10-year period from 2005 to 2014, there were over 60 cases of both major and minor infringements.
We are concerned about this increase in numbers, because any compromise to the structural integrity of HDB blocks can have catastrophic consequences. Hence, clause 4 of the Bill will amend section 27, to do three things. First, any security deposit placed by the RRC for contravening any obligation imposed on the RRC in the permit may be forfeited. Second, HDB may impose a financial penalty not exceeding $10,000 on errant renovation contractors and flat owners for contravening any condition of a licence, the contravention of which does not amount to an offence. And third, the penalty against errant renovation contractors, including those not registered with HDB, and flat owners will be raised, by increasing the maximum court fine from $5,000 to $20,000 and providing the courts with an option to impose an imprisonment term of up to one year.
Madam, let me now move on to clause 12 of the Bill, which allows HDB to impose variable penalties for lease infringements.
HDB stipulates a set of conditions in each lease agreement for two main reasons. First, they ensure that HDB flats are used for its intended purpose. The Home Ownership Scheme was introduced in 1964 to enable Singaporeans to own their homes, and have a stake in the country's future. Thus, HDB flats are highly subsidised, and are meant primarily for owner occupation. To ensure that this system is not abused, potential buyers must meet certain eligibility criteria, such as citizenship requirements and household income before they can apply for an HDB flat. In addition, lessees must live in their flats for a minimum period before they can sell or sublet their whole flat. Second, HDB also plays a key role in building communities and fostering neighbourly ties in our public housing estates. The conditions in the lease agreement facilitate this by spelling out appropriate behaviour, so that all residents can enjoy a pleasant living environment in a densely populated city.
From time to time, however, some flat owners have abused the system. Most commonly, flat owners contravene the lease terms such as the five-year Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), and sublet their whole flat without obtaining HDB's approval to do so. HDB has also encountered cases of flat owners using their homes as illegal gambling dens, or as illegal worker dormitories, which create an undesirable and sometimes unsafe living environment for genuine HDB residents.
Under the Act today, HDB may compulsorily acquire a flat, vest a flat or terminate the lease of a flat. Under the Rules, HDB may impose a penalty instead of compulsorily acquiring the flat. However, HDB is unable, at this time, to vary the magnitude of the penalty to make it proportionate to the severity of the infringement in some cases, even if there are good reasons to do so. This puts HDB in a very difficult position: should it exercise compulsory acquisition, which can be draconian and traumatic to the home owner, or should it impose a penalty that it feels may be out of proportion to the severity of the infringement in that particular case? In some of such cases, the practical reality is that HDB has erred on the side of compassion and waived the penalty in full. But this is not ideal, and can create a moral hazard.
To set this right, clause 12 of the Bill amends section 65 of the Act to allow HDB to impose a variable range of penalties, not exceeding $50,000, instead of compulsory acquisition or vesting of the flat, depending on the severity of the infringement under sections 47, 55 and 56 of the Act. With these amendments, HDB can now implement a calibrated penalty framework instead of being faced with the stark choice of compulsory acquisition on the one hand or a fixed quantum penalty on the other.
Madam, let me now elaborate on the enhanced powers to investigate lease infringements.
As I have explained earlier, HDB takes a serious view of the misuse of public housing. This is because HDB flats are highly subsidised, and are meant primarily for owner occupation. The misuse of flats can cause disamenities to fellow residents, and HDB needs to be able to investigate suspected cases of misuse and take appropriate action where necessary.
Today, HDB's powers to conduct a thorough investigation into suspected lease infringements are limited. From time to time, HDB officers meet resistance from flat owners. Some have refused to cooperate with HDB. Others go so far as to challenge HDB's right to investigate the matter. However, HDB is not able to compel flat owners to cooperate with the investigation. This makes it very difficult for HDB officers to carry out their public duty.
Clause 8 of the Bill, therefore, introduces two new provisions that will give HDB officers the power to investigate the serious infringements set out under section 56. New section 56A authorises HDB officers to enter and search any flat or other premises that the owner or occupier may be residing in, and record evidence in the form of photographs, videos and audio. As a safeguard, the Act requires HDB to first obtain a warrant from the court. The officer must also identify himself to the flat owner or occupier, and show him the court warrant as well as official proof of identity. New section 56B enables HDB officers to examine witnesses, take statements and produce documents relevant to their fact-finding.
These powers will enable HDB to conduct proper fact-finding and establish whether there have been serious breaches of HDB rules that may require action to be taken. HDB will use these powers judiciously and only when necessary, and officers who carry out such investigations will be properly trained to use them professionally.
Madam, let me now move onto the remaining miscellaneous amendments in the Bill.
Section 61(1) of the Act makes it an offence for HDB home owners to sublet their flats without HDB's prior written consent. As HDB is already empowered under section 56 to take action against unauthorised subletting, we think that should suffice. Moreover, HDB has not charged any person under this section. Clause 11, therefore, repeals section 61.
Section 59(1) empowers HDB to remove the belongings of ex-lessees or occupants after recovering possession of the flats that have been compulsorily acquired. Clause 10 inserts a new provision to allow HDB to sell or dispose of any unclaimed moveable property found in the flat if the owner does not take delivery of the property, and to pay the proceeds, less expenses, to the owner or into Court.
Currently, compulsory acquisition notices arising from serious infringements of HDB rules can only be served on flat owners or, if they have passed on, on their personal representatives. Clause 7 rationalises this procedure to allow compulsory acquisition notices to be served in situations where no personal representative has been appointed. In such situations, HDB will affix the notice on a conspicuous place outside the flat.
Section 58(2) allows HDB to deposit the compulsory acquisition compensation with the Court under two circumstances. First, when HDB is unable to pay out the compensation to the relevant parties if the persons refuse to accept the compensation or dispute the amount of compensation. Second, when HDB is unable to locate the lessees or interested parties. Clause 9 widens this and introduces three additional circumstances under which HDB can deposit the compensation in Court so that HDB will not have to hold on to the compensation monies indefinitely. These are: (1) where the person is mentally incapacitated and has not executed a lasting power of attorney or appointed a deputy to manage his affairs; (2) where the person has passed on and has no personal representative; and (3) where the persons involved have a dispute as to the entitlement to the compensation.
Clause 14 amends section 81 to provide that all fines paid or recovered under the Act are to be paid into the Consolidated Fund.
Madam, the amendments proposed today will enable and empower HDB to be more nimble, effective and relevant, for current and future generations of home owners.
Madam, I beg to move.
Question proposed.
: Mdm Speaker, the majority of Singaporeans live in HDB blocks. Unlike private developers, HDB's job is not done after it has sold a flat. HDB continues to play an important role in ensuring that the HDB estate continues to be a safe and pleasant living environment for all HDB residents.
The Housing and Development Act provides the legal instrument for HDB to do its job effectively. The last time the Act was amended was in 2012. This latest amendment is timely, particularly in dealing with three issues we face in the community: first, protection of the structural beam to preserve the structural integrity of HDB blocks; second, ceiling leaks; and, third, illegal subletting.
As a professional engineer, I can fully appreciate the importance of the structural beams or columns. The structural beams or columns bear the load of the building. If these elements are damaged, the structural integrity of the building may be affected, which may, in turn, potentially endanger the safety of residents in the building and the public.
There have been some cases whereby renovation contractors hack the structural beam or column during renovation works, due to lack of awareness, supervision or carelessness.
We also do not rule out the possibility where residents of unsound mind hack off the structural beam or column, though, fortunately, there have not been any cases so far. So, there is no cause for alarm, but we should not be complacent, too. Just one case can result in a huge human tragedy. It is, therefore, necessary for HDB to have some powers to enter flats to investigate and repair, to prevent a catastrophe.
Currently, HDB already has a registration regime which helps ensure that the registered renovation contractors are properly trained and familiar with HDB property. However, in cases whereby errant renovation contractors and lessees carry out unauthorised renovation work, we must strengthen HDB's ability to take them to task, through the imposition of financial penalties.
Many of my residents, knowing that I am a professional engineer, very often, when I walk around or house visit or even in coffee shops, would show me very beautiful plans done by their interior designers and they wanted to hack away some of the walls or columns. Normally, I advise them to submit their plans to HDB to get proper approval before proceeding.
There was one recent case in Pasir Ris where frequent loud knocking noises were heard coming out from a unit. HDB, together with other agencies, visited the unit during day and night but there was no response from the occupier. There was a concern that the structural integrity of the building might be compromised as some occupants in the block mentioned that they could feel the vibration from their units. But the occupant refused to allow anyone to enter the flat. Eventually, HDB managed to enter the flat with the help of the Police and found that the occupant had been knocking part of the two walls with a wooden plank. Fortunately, both walls are non-structural walls. What if the occupant had hacked a structural wall? The potential consequence could have been undesirable.
Some people are concerned about giving more intrusive powers to HDB. But I think these powers are necessary to ensure safety. There are safeguards in place. I am sure HDB will use the powers sparingly and only when absolutely necessary. The day may come when we are thankful that we have passed this Bill to give HDB the powers to intervene.
Ceiling leakage is a common problem, especially in older buildings, particularly in wet areas, such as the toilets and kitchens. It occurs when water from the upper floor unit leaks into the ceiling of the lower floor through the concrete floor slab. As an MP, over the years, I have had residents approach me to give feedback about how they had to deal with persistent ceiling leak problems. While most neighbours are cooperative and take steps to fix the leak to their neighbour's flat below, there are others who do not act, perhaps because the leak does not affect them directly, or they may have other reasons, for example, a sick family member or an expectant wife.
Today, the responsibility of maintaining the flats rests with the HDB owner. In the case of ceiling leaks, both the upstairs and downstairs units are collectively responsible to fix the leak. HDB's Goodwill Repair Assistance scheme is helpful in absorbing half of the costs. I think that more should be done so that HDB dwellers who have ceiling leaks in their flats, especially the more serious ones requiring urgent attention, do not have to suffer and be inconvenienced without any hope of resolution.
I remember during one of my house visits, a resident took me to her toilet and showed me how serious the leakage was. She has to place an umbrella in the toilet because where the leakage is, it is just directly above where she does her business. So, an umbrella is placed there. And she blamed HDB for not taking action. But then, when I checked, of course, HDB had some problem in getting the upper unit to be cooperative.
The Ministry's proposal to empower HDB to enter the flat to investigate and repair cases, such as serious ceiling leaks and spalling concrete, is a reasonable and balanced approach. In fact, it should have been done earlier. It would help alleviate the misery of some of my residents who had been suffering in silence.
Besides keeping our HDB blocks safe, HDB must continue to ensure that the HDB estate is a pleasant living environment for all HDB dwellers. HDB flats are primarily meant for owner occupation, but there are owners who try to circumvent the HDB's rules by locking up one room and subletting the flat without physically staying in it. They are subletting their flats in an unauthorised manner and should not be allowed to continue. I am glad that the Ministry is looking into enhancing HDB's levers of investigation and enforcement against lease infringements, including illegal subletting. HDB officers must be able to investigate fully and take effective enforcement action against unauthorised or illegal activity. Hence, I strongly support giving HDB officers enhanced powers of investigation so that they can build up a strong case to take errant lessees to task.
Apart from illegal subletting of flat, there are other instances of flat misuse, such as operating an illegal gambling den, housing vice-related activities and short-term stay to tourists. In the interest of their safety and that of the residents in their blocks, I would urge all residents to do their part to alert the authorities if and when they observe their neighbours engaging in such activities.
Other horror instance was one which I recall reading a news report last year about a hoarder whose flat was consistently smelly and pest-infested. The neighbours had to put up with the stench and unwelcome visits from cockroaches for a few years, even after he passed away. His next-of-kin could not be located and nobody could gain permission to enter his flat to clean it up. The Town Council only manages common areas, and the HDB did not have the authority to enter the premises.
If HDB had been granted the authority for access to the flat back then, perhaps more could have been done for the hoarder, and his neighbours would not have to suffer so much. As this incident is somewhat related, but not resultant from damaged HDB fixtures, I would like to ask: does the Bill also give HDB the responsibility and authority to intervene in similar cases?
I believe this Bill may give rise to some resentment among HDB flat owners who feel that their ownership rights are being infringed upon. I urge them to put themselves in the shoes of the lower-floor residents or neighbours. These residents are the ones who are having their ownership rights infringed upon if they have to suffer from your uncooperative attitude. Why should your neighbours have to bear with the leaks and the stench? Put yourself in the shoes of the one at the receiving end.
Entering someone's property without the owner's explicit permission is indeed a very serious matter that bears a great responsibility. The right to do so must come with some precautionary measures. First of all, there needs to be established, a protocol that determines when it is necessary to exercise this authority. Surely all viable options must be exhausted before the HDB can consider it. A suitable deadline for the occupant to take action must also be established. How long does he or she have to call in a plumber before HDB takes action? The HDB officers must make efforts to give ample advance notice, ensuring that the recipient is aware, before they simply turn up at the resident's house. Preferably this can be done by phone calls and letters. The proposed Bill cites that the Board must give the occupant at least a 24-hour notice of its intention to enter the premises. I believe we could perhaps extend this to 48 hours, unless the damage is potentially life-threatening.
We must ensure that HDB officers have proper identification before they enter the homes. Photographs should be taken if there is no one in the house so that any subsequent complaint can be addressed. There should be proper documentation and video recording of the works being carried out in the absence of the owners. I do not know if HDB has worked out the process to prevent any accusation of theft or damage to belongings to protect its own interest?
It is disappointing that we have to resort to such enforcement methods to resolve problems between neighbours. If everyone could be more neighbourly and generous with their goodwill, such problems can be easily resolved without the need for intervention by Government officers or the law. We must step up efforts to promote neighbourliness and mutual cooperation among residents.
Finally, it is befitting that in talking about HDB we pay tribute to our founding father, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. It was his foresight in building affordable public housing across our country that we were able to nip the bud of the housing problem for Singaporeans. I believe today, we have the highest homeownership in the world. I have a lot of foreign friends who visited Singapore and they told me that they really admire our public housing. And they told me that our public housing is better, in many aspects, compared to even some of their condominiums back in their own country.
With this, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.
: Mdm Speaker, firstly, I would like to declare that I am the President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry. Having carefully examined the relevant clauses, I support the Bill. However, reading through more than 20 pages of this Bill has stirred up many thoughts in me. I hope that using legislation to solve such problems would only be the last resort.
The objective of amending this Bill is mainly to empower HDB officials to enter the HDB premises to investigate or arrange for renovation work. Are these matters so serious that they warrant legislation before they can be resolved? When I was young, having neighbours help each other out was very common. Everyone would reach out to help whichever household needed assistance. Whenever we patronised the
kopitiam
, the proprietors would remember which customers preferred to have less sugar in their coffee, and whose children attended which schools; if we went to the neighbourhood provision shop to buy soya sauce, we would always linger to chat with the proprietors. This frequent interaction among neighbours, watching out for each other and helping one another, was part and parcel of the
kampung
spirit we always talk about.
In the 50 years since Singapore gained independence, the Housing and Development Board has provided the majority of Singaporeans with their own homes, and has continually upgraded their living environment, with the establishment of neighbourhood shops, coffee shops, hair salons, clinics, activity centres,
et cetera
, to increase the interaction among residents and promote social bonding and cohesion. This has been a major contribution to social development. Although
kampungs
have vanished from our modern urbanised city, HDB has already tried its best to preserve the "
kampung
spirit" in designing HDB flats and neighbourhoods.
If we move back in time to30 or 40 years ago, two households from the
kampungs
together moved into new HDB flats. If the Zhang family's ceiling springs a leak, they would simply go upstairs to the Tan family's flat to take a look. Legislation would not be necessary. It is a different story now. Residents seldom interact even if they live in the same building, and are not familiar with one another. They do not know each other's surnames, professions, and do not talk though they may take the same lift. Relations are quite estranged. If there is any knock on the door, residents would speak from behind their iron gates and be very guarded. Hence, we need to amend the Bill to give HDB officials more empowerment. If problems among neighbours need to resort to legislation, this could solve the problem, but it would sever ties that may be impossible to mend.
People's lifestyles are also gradually changing in keeping with the times. Different generations have different focuses in their life, and the social functions of neighbourhood shops and public facilities also need to adapt to the changing times. Unlike the supermarkets and large shopping centres, neighbourhood shops can create a congenial meeting place for all residents, and they need to adjust their business model according to the residents' composition and lifestyle patterns to provide even more unique products and services. Hence, the management of neighbourhood shops should not only be viewed purely in terms of commercial profit, becoming an investment tool or an asset to be resold.
Early this month, the SCCCI specially invited Merchants' Associations from several neighbourhood centres to attend a lunch meeting. Everyone reached a consensus that rebuilding the "
kampung
spirit" in their neighbourhoods and new towns would require the coordination and hard work of many parties. HDB needs to be even more forward-looking in their design concepts, and correspondingly there needs to be mutual support and coordination amongst the Town Councils, Citizens' Consultative Committees, Community Development Councils, Community Centres and Residents' Committees. Shop owners need to consider ways to do their business better and should actively support the Merchants' Associations. The leadership of the Merchants' Associations needs to demonstrate team spirit in strategic planning and come up with innovative ideas and marketing concepts unique to their areas. Although each community congregates organisations with diverse backgrounds, they all serve the same group of people, with the common objective of looking after the interests of their respective residents.
Singapore is a land-scarce country and we have no choice but to construct high-rise buildings. With a more diversified population structure, we need a longer time to establish better understanding and trust among people, and tighten the bonds of social cohesion. This social cohesion pertains to the concern and help from family members, neighbours and friends, and cannot be measured with monetary value. Thus, when we face problems, we have to tackle them at the root and not only on the surface. We should not forget that the social function of public housing is to create the opportunity for Singaporeans from different races and ethnicities living in HDB estates to interact and live together in harmony.
: Mdm Speaker, this amendment in this Bill affects 87% of our citizens who live in HDB flats in Singapore.
I welcome HDB's stance to take a more proactive approach to compel errant and stubborn residents fix the negative externalities of water seepage from ceilings, over-hoarding of goods and erecting permanent features that may cause structural damage to the building.
I support the stricter penalties for flat-owners who use non-HDB approved contractors which the amendments of this Bill proposes and would also suggest that there should be stricter vetting of approved contractors for HDB flat dwellers.
Mdm Speaker, it concerns me that the amendments to this Bill may present many ambiguous areas in the law leading to potential abuse.
Under clause 3, section 26A, authorised officers or persons may enter any premises at any reasonable time by giving a 24-hour notice to investigate or carry out urgent repairs or works.
A 24-hour notice period is too short. It is insufficient in cases where the owner of the flat may be away, or hospitalised or living overseas. More effort should be made to contact him or her. The notice should include text messages, phone calls as well as written notices to their place of residence.
Would the Minister give us a reason why such a short 24-hour notice period, unless it is a life-threatening case, and not a longer period of one week?
The Bill should allow flexible time for HDB officers to investigate and carry out urgent repairs or works after office hours and even on weekends until 10 pm to facilitate those who are working late.
Under section 26B of the Bill, HDB is given sweeping powers when it confers one or more authorised officers and authorised persons to enter a premise with force if necessary to investigate and carry out urgent repairs or works to prevent or remove the danger if there is reasonable grounds to believe there is imminent threat to public safety or public health.
Under this Bill, HDB need not compensate the flat owners for any mistakes or intrusion as long as it had acted in good faith and in accordance with its rules.
Considering the costs which may be prohibitive for flat owners or occupiers who may have to rectify the forced entry into their premises and also the huge hurdles to take HDB to court for any wrongdoing, perceived or real, will there be sufficient safeguards for flat owners?
Will HDB be held accountable should the emergency not exist and not caused by a problem in the flat which forced entry has been obtained?
For this, I would like to seek the Minister's clarification on what constitutes a reasonable ground to believe that there is an imminent danger in a premise which affects public safety or public health which warrants urgent repairs, and (a) the definition of urgent repairs; (b) the list of specific examples which warrant urgent "repairs", public safety and public health.
The HDB employs many estate managers in branch offices who are arts, science and business graduates who may hold dual roles as customer service managers and technical officers and may not have the expertise to inspect the damages.
The HDB officer who is assessing the damage to the neighbour should ideally be trained building science graduate to access if it warrants urgent repairs.
I would recommend to make it a statutory requirement for all HDB officers to wear a recording device before entering the premises, much like police officers who wear it nowadays for the prevention of disputes.
With the proposed amendments to the Bill under sections 56A and 56B, authorised HDB officers are given police-like powers to enter HDB flats which it suspects are flouting its rules. They have the power to make audio and video recordings, interrogate suspects and seize evidence. HDB officers are not Police and do not have the necessary training. Is this a clear case of a conflict of interest whereby the HDB is both investigator and judge as to whether the owner has breached its rules? It should be the Police to carry out such investigations.
Mdm Speaker, despite the current problems with non-cooperative flat owners and breaches of HDB rules, the proposed amendments give too much power to the HDB with insufficient safeguards. How many residents will be aware of their rights and legal representation of HDB's new sweeping powers?
:
I propose to take the break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 4.50 pm.
Sitting accordingly suspended
at 4.33 pm until 4.50 pm.
Sitting resumed at 4.50 pm.
Debate resumed.
: Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill.
A key feature of the Bill is the power of entry for HDB for investigation and urgent repairs. For many long-suffering residents whose neighbours have been uncooperative or worse, acting in violation of the law, this measure is overdue and provides much welcomed assurance of safety and security.
In cases where there are looming dangers such as structural damages where the safety of residents is at stake, HDB's right to access the problematic units is undisputable. With the amendment, HDB will no longer require a court warrant and necessary action can be taken immediately.
I would like to ask the Minister: how many of such cases have occurred in recent years; which are the most common hazards, and what measures are in place to prevent the recurrence of such incidents?
On the other hand, where the situations are not quite as dire, such as a ceiling leak, there are some criticisms about the proposal to allow entry with court warrants in cases where owners ignore a 24-hour notice period and had not allowed for HDB staff entry.
Some feel that such a measure is heavy handed. Others worry about abuse of such powers. The critics in the first group may not be aware of the severity of this problem. As the Minister of State had shared before, each year alone, there are about 2,800 ceiling-leak cases which take more than three months to resolve.
In addition, every year, HDB have to take about 120 flat owners to court to compel them to provide access to their flats for investigation and repairs.
It is important for the Ministry to highlight to all HDB owners that the 24-hour notice is only given in cases where the flat owners have been persistently uncooperative. It would be useful for HDB to clarify what constitutes uncooperative behaviour.
Would the Ministry elaborate on what actions HDB has to take and exhaust before it acts to force the flat owner to allow access to carry out the investigation and repair works? How long will the whole process take before forced entry is made as a last resort, as pointed out by other Members in the House?
What would happen if the owners need a longer time to accede to the request due to, for example, medical reasons, but the owners of the unit below cannot accommodate? Or if the owners of the upper floor unit claim that they cannot comply at all due to medical concerns? There may also be cases where the owners are away for extended periods or are, so-called "uncontactable". What alternatives are available to HDB officers?
I would like to suggest that HDB conduct thorough investigations of affected units to ensure that causes of problems originating from other sources are excluded before approaching the suspected units. For example, there had been cases where the ceiling leaks tend to occur only on rainy days because they were caused by cracks in external walls on the upper floor, not from the upper floor unit per se. Sharing information about such prior investigations with the owners of the units above will assure them that they are not being inconvenienced unnecessarily.
I would also like to ask what would happen if the remedial works still fail to rectify problems. Would the owners still need to pay for additional costs of further investigations? What if further investigations reveal that an errant diagnosis is due to a HDB contractor?
Presently, HDB bears half of the repair costs of leakages and spalling concrete, with the other half shared equally by upper- and lower-floor flat owners. Generally, flat owners pay about $180 for each ceiling-leak repair. Despite this heavily subsidised price, there are owners who face financial hardship and cannot afford to pay. Does HDB have assistance schemes in place to help such families to pay for such expenses?
Another important advantage of allowing HDB officers to enter flats with warrants is that we now have another tool to stamp out the illegal subletting of flats or their use for non-residential purposes. Presently, owners and tenants can refuse to let HDB officers enter their flats to investigate lease infringements. Many of such cases include overcrowding leading to disturbances and an unsafe environment for the neighbours. Hence, I am in full support of providing our enforcement officers with this new tool for a safer neighbourhood. Let me continue and conclude in Mandarin.
: I support this Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill. On the surface, provisions of the Bill may appear to be giving HDB officers excessive power to enter HDB flats which are suspected to have problems to conduct investigation and repair. However, the HDB would only do so as the last resort.
Every year, there are as many as 2,800 cases of ceiling leak cases which take more than three months to resolve. In some cases, it may take even more than a year to be dealt with. And there are more than 100 households who refuse to cooperate and HDB has to apply for a court warrant in order to enter the unit to investigate. This is time-consuming and taxpayer's money is wasted.
Some residents are worried that after the Bill is amended, some people may pose as HDB officers and coerce the residents into opening their doors for them to get in. Although HDB has reminded the residents to verify that they are HDB officers, but some residents say that they cannot tell whether the documents are genuine are not. And they are also concerned whether their privacy could be preserved.
I hope that the Minister could take into account these concerns and worries of the residents and put forward the relevant measures that HDB is going to take. Thank you.
: Mdm Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak on the proposed Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill.
Having lived in a low-floor HDB unit for 10 years, I can fully appreciate the distress and anxiety suffered when flat owners experience cracks on ceiling or walls, and water leakages, be it in our bedrooms, kitchen or living room, causing damage to our furniture and fittings. I remember at least two occasions when the unit directly above mine did major renovation works for months, which created some concerns for us. In such a situation, we would have been grateful to have a hotline for us to report any damages or leakages in our unit, and would have appreciated that such problems are resolved promptly. With the proposed amendment, HDB will be able to do more to help residents resolve such problems quickly.
Madam, with this Bill, HDB will have greater powers in entering premises, with or without a warrant, to investigate and to carry out urgent repairs. But I feel that central to this amendment, first and foremost should be the residents' well-being and safety, and not so much to make it more convenient or easier for HDB to carry out their work. I also feel that giving more power to HDB to gain access to residents' flats is a double-edge sword because, on the one hand, it can please residents whose problems get resolved, but on the other hand, it can upset those who are unhappy with the intrusion or who feel unfairly treated. I therefore hope that HDB look carefully and thoroughly into residents' concerns, address them in a fair manner and ensure that with these new powers, HDB gain more trust from the public instead of more distrust.
Madam, from the standpoint of residents, there are a few concerns, some of which have already been raised by hon Members previously, and I hope for some clarifications on these areas.
First, is on communicating to the public on the need and intent of the Bill. A home is a sanctuary and I think residents will have concerns on invasion of their privacy. Hence, HDB should clarify on the circumstances where such an enforced entry is warranted and why it is justified, so that the general public can clearly understand the need for such enforced entry.
Secondly, occupants that are present during the enforced entry should be treated with dignity and decorum. This could be a living-in maid, an elderly, the incapacitated or a child who may feel intimidated by the presence of officials.
I hope HDB implements a code of conduct on the behaviour of the officers in engaging occupants present during the enforced entry, so as not to cause undue distress to these persons. It is also ideal to have officers who can converse in dialect or ethnic Mother Tongue to communicate with non-English speaking occupants.
My third concern is the probability that this amendment will create an opportunity for criminals to gain access to residents' premises. I think there is a danger that parties with criminal intent may take the opportunity to gain access to premises which may then result in undesired and serious consequences. It may be worthwhile to consider providing a hotline for owners or occupants to verify the identity of the officials. Owners or occupants should be encouraged to verify the identity of officials and the purpose of gaining entry, as identity cards and documents can be forged and can fool unsuspecting residents.
My fourth concern is on potential dispute on costs of repairs. The Bill states that HDB will claim from the owner the costs incurred in the repairs. For costly bills, this may be problematic. The owner may dispute that he or she was not consulted on the potential costs of the repair work and may not have the funds to pay for it. How then will HDB handle such a scenario?
The fifth concern is damages done as a result of enforced entry. The Amendment Bill states that HDB is not liable to compensate the owner for any losses incurred due to the damage done at the premises. I think this is an area that may cause much unhappiness to residents as it appears unfair to owners who may not be aware of HDB's intention to enforce entry. Can HDB explain the basis for this and will HDB consider on a case-to-case basis to compensate owners, for example, in hardship cases?
Finally, can HDB explain the justification for the 24-hour notice, which I find, just like other Members here, to be too short? Will HDB consider a longer notice period to give owners more time to respond? Madam, in Malay, please.
: Sometimes, we are unfortunate enough to experience cracks on walls or the ceiling of our HDB flats, spalling concrete or water leakages because of renovation work done by our neighbours. In such situations, what can flat owners do? With the proposed changes to the Housing and Development Act, HDB will have greater powers to gain entry into HDB flats to investigate the cause of the problems and to undertake repairs urgently. This is beneficial to residents and residents should take advantage of this change by proactively alerting HDB of renovation works which may jeopardise the structural integrity of the building and create danger for residents.
However, there will be some occupants who may not be comfortable to let in strangers even if they are HDB officers, especially if the flat owner is not around and have given them instructions to not allow these officers into the premises. In such situations, I hope HDB officers will be mindful to engage occupants with due respect and give occupants proper assurances.
Aside from empowering HDB with the power to enter premises with or without a warrant, there are other areas which I hope HDB can provide more clarification. One of the clauses states that HDB will be able to claim the cost of repairs from owners. I think this may create a problem, especially if the flat owners were not consulted and the cost turned out to be high. Another clause states that HDB is not liable to compensate the owner for any losses incurred due to damages done at the premises. For both these scenarios, I hope the Ministry can reconsider and provide assistance to cover the cost partially, if not wholly, for those who may have difficulty to cope with the expenses.
Another concern I have is the possibility that criminals may pose as HDB officers to gain access to flats and commit a crime. I hope there are sufficient education efforts and safeguards to protect residents from those who may take advantage of unsuspecting residents.
Madam, I would conclude in English, please. While I support the Bill, I hope HDB will provide clarifications on some of the concerns that have been raised today and give the public greater assurance that the well-being of the public is at the heart of these proposed amendments. Thank you.
: Mdm Speaker, many hon Members of the House would have experienced residents' complaints about ceiling leakage issues taking months to resolve. A quick check of my mailbox revealed two latest incidents. One incident happened in a Jurong West flat. The feedback was received in October last year. The neighbour upstairs who was responsible for the leaking ceiling in the flat downstairs, refused to use the renovation contractor recommended by HDB and decided to engage his own contractor to do the repair. Unfortunately, the repair was not carried out properly and the problem was not resolved. The case dragged on until last month, taking a good six months before the problem was finally resolved.
I have another similar case of ceiling leakage in a Jurong East flat this time round, and it also took six months to resolve, from July to December 2014.
During the six-month period, you could imagine the agony of the residents who had to endure the ceiling leakage. This Amendment Bill is thus very helpful and timely to help mitigate the suffering of the residents who are victims of their inconsiderate neighbours. This is especially so when we have more than 80% of the resident population in Singapore staying in 940,000 HDB flats across the island and not all residents are cooperative.
However, critics may perceive such honourable intents as being draconian and autocratic. When we introduced the ban on the sale of chewing gum, we were the laughing stock of the western liberal societies who disregarded the rationale behind the policy. In fact,
The Guardian
, a London newspaper, devoted an entire article to the ban of chewing gum when Mr Lee Kuan Yew passed on, instead of acknowledging that the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew had transformed Singapore from a Third World country to First in less than a lifetime.
When we introduced caning against vandalism, we were called less than favourable terms, never mind the need to protect the property and public amenities. When we used hanging as a measure to control drug abuse and other very serious crimes, we were still very much condemned for being a cruel regime. Hence, the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill that confers authorised HDB staff with the power to enter a flat with force and without prior notice to the occupier could go down as another example of Singapore's harsh autocratic laws. We must, however, decide what works for us.
Having said that, we need HDB to convince us of their proposed safeguards to prevent abuse of power. At this juncture, Madam, please allow me to speak in Mandarin.
: Mdm Speaker, section 26A of the Bill allows HDB officers to forcibly enter a HDB flat with a warrant to remove illegal renovation features or conduct emergency repair work. I urge HDB to exercise this power with a human touch and show compassion.
In Jurong, there are some illiterate elderly residents who go out early in the morning and come back late in the evening to earn a living. In the worst circumstance, we do not want to see a situation whereby an elderly person living alone leaves his home and, two hours later, HDB officers paste the warrant on his door. When the elderly person comes back in the evening, because he is illiterate, he may take down the warrant and intend to find a friend to explain to him what the warrant is all about the next day. However, the following day, after he goes out at 7.00 am as usual, HDB officers make a forced entry. We also do not want to see the situation whereby families returning from a week-long holiday find their flat being forcibly entered by HDB officers under the power provided by section 26B when a forced entry is allowed without a warrant.
Hence, I hope HDB can put up some safeguard mechanism to prevent the power from being abused inadvertently. I would like to ask the Minister of State three questions.
First, Minister Khaw revealed last December that, every year, there were about 9,000 ceiling leak cases. Among them, 2,800 cases took more than three months to resolve. I would like to ask the Minister of State, suppose the Bill was passed a year ago, then how many such ceiling leak cases for which the power provided under section 26A or 26B would potentially have been applicable to deal with those uncooperative residents?
Second, the power provided under section 26A and 26B is very comprehensive. I would like to ask the Minister of State how HDB is going to train its officers to make sure that they use this power appropriately, and with a human touch? At the same time, will HDB set up a special committee to establish a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for forced entries?
Third, I would like to ask the Minister of State whether HDB can first consider using other channels to engage and persuade residents to cooperate, such as working together with grassroots leaders, to work out a solution. Section 26A and B should only be used as a last resort.
Mdm Speaker, as mentioned in my Chinese speech, all of us prefer to resolve disputes informally and amicably. In many instances, our grassroots leaders and community leaders could try to get involved and act as mediators. Even if the Amendment Bill were to be passed, we need a structure and system to deal with such matters fairly, consistently and efficiently, and ensure that the power provided in this Amendment should only be used cautiously and only as a last resort, as mentioned by the Minister of State.
Madam, in this regard, I would urge HDB to perhaps study the Hong Kong Housing Authority's Marking Scheme for Estate Management in Public Housing Estates before exercising the power of forced entry into a flat. The Hong Kong system, although meant for the public rental housing estate tenants, and similar to our traffic offence demerits system, could be a preferred softer approach in dealing with recalcitrant HDB flat owners before applying the harsher law of forced entry and financial penalty.
In the Hong Kong Marking System, a public housing flat tenant may be terminated from renting public housing if the owner has accumulated 16 demerit points or more within two years. For example, denying a public servant to enter the flat for inspection would yield a penalty of seven points and refusal to repair a leaking pipe another seven points, rendering the tenant close to being dispelled from his flat. Similarly, HDB could consider a similar demerit system to soften the harsh law stipulated in the Amendment Bill. With that, I support the Bill.
: Madam, I thank Er Lee Bee Wah, Mr Thomas Chua, Mrs Lina Chiam, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein and Mr Ang Wei Neng for their thoughtful comments and questions. They understand the need for this Bill and support its objective, but they would like to know how the new powers will be exercised and what safeguards will be in place.
While Er Lee Bee Wah supports the Bill, she reminds this House that entering someone's property, abode, home, without his explicit permission, is a very serious matter that bears a great responsibility. Mr Mohd Ismail spoke about the need to explain clearly to the public the circumstances under which HDB will make a forced entry, so that they understand the need for this to be done. I agree with both of them.
As I shared earlier, HDB will make a forced entry, without warrant, only under exceptional circumstances, if and only if, there is imminent danger to public safety or health and time is of the essence, and HDB has no other means to gain entry to the flat to solve the problem. In other words, HDB will only contemplate a forced entry in response to a "distress call", and not just to undertake any repair, so rest assured.
The most likely situation under which HDB will exercise this power, which Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mrs Lina Chiam had asked about, is when structural walls and columns are demolished, thereby threatening the structural integrity of the building and the safety of all the residents, and the owner or occupier cannot be contacted despite HDB's best efforts or, worse, they refuse HDB entry in such dire circumstances. In such cases, HDB needs to be able to intervene, and intervene quickly, a point reiterated by Er Lee Bee Wah who had shared with the House the importance of structural beams in bearing the load of the whole building.
Mr Gan Thiam Poh had asked about the measures that HDB has to mitigate the risk of damage to HDB flats in the course of renovation. Currently, HDB adopts a three-pronged approach. First, under current renovation guidelines, HDB flat owners are required to engage HDB-registered renovation contractors (RRCs) to do any renovation works. These RRCs are trained. They understand where the structural walls are, where the beams are, and they know better than to knock those down. They also have to obtain HDB's prior approval before starting any renovation work, especially those that involve demolition or hacking. This is to ensure that any demolition works proposed will not affect the structural integrity of the building and compromise public safety.
Second, HDB requires all HDB RRCs to engage only certified workers. So, it is not just the contractors who must understand, but the workers must also be certified. These workers must have been trained by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Academy, to carry out demolition or hacking works of walls during the renovation of HDB flats. So, we control both when they renovate – at the contractor level, but also at the individual worker level.
Third, HDB conducts checks on units during demolition or hacking works. This is to send a strong signal to the industry and the renovation contractors to be vigilant and careful in carrying out demolition or hacking works.
Most flat owners also play their part in ensuring the safety of their homes by only engaging HDB RRCs and obtaining HDB's prior approval for proposed renovation works. But there are some owners who will instruct the workers to carry out demolition works that have not been approved by HDB. Sometimes, the contractors themselves are not aware that the instructions have gone directly from the home owner to the workers onsite. In the past three years, there was on average five cases of unauthorised demolition or hacking of structural walls and columns each year. The numbers are not big, but you would agree with me that each and every case is a cause for concern.
Mr Ismail had asked whether owners have to bear the cost of damage in the course of HDB's forced entry into the flat, and Mrs Lina Chiam was concerned to ask if there are sufficient safeguards for flat owners since the cost of damage could be prohibitive. Allow me to first set the issue in context: most residents will readily oblige when HDB explains the necessity for their entry into their flats.
Mr Thomas Chua's analogy, let me extend it, if the Teo family downstairs explained to the Tan family upstairs that, "You know I have this problem", in most cases, neighbours will oblige even if they may not have talked to each other in the lift. I think it is just out of basic humanity because upstairs units causing problems to the unit downstairs, they may in turn be the downstairs units of the future, some years down the road.
For the small number who refuse to cooperate with HDB and their neighbours despite HDB's best efforts at engagement, most will comply if HDB, as a last resort, invokes these new legal powers or obtains a warrant issued by the court. So, it will probably be very rare, if at all, that a flat owner will refuse to comply either with an order of court, or ignore a legal order issued under this Act, and cause HDB to have to make that forced entry causing damage. I think it will be very rare. The mere fact that it is an order or a court order ought to suffice. But please be assured that when HDB officials do have to do this, they will try their best to avoid or minimise any damage in the course of doing so. And when the families are indigent and they face hardship, these are things that we all will look at, in totality. Madam, allow me to continue in Mandarin.
: In all other situations where there is no imminent danger, HDB will continue its existing approach of engagement and persuasion, for example, to deal with ceiling leak cases, which many MPs have received feedback on. As Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Ang Wei Neng mentioned, about 30% of ceiling leak problems, or 2,800 cases a year, took more than three months to resolve, even though actual repair works took only three to four days.
In some instances, as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Gan Thiam Poh pointed out, there may be understandable reasons why the upper-floor neighbours may not grant HDB access to address the problem.
First, the upper-floor neighbours may happen to be overseas for a long period of time or cannot be contacted. In such a situation, HDB will continue its current procedure of trying to contact the owner for permission to enter the flat to check. If the owner remains non-contactable or cannot be present because he is overseas, HDB will make an effort to contact the next-of-kin.
Second, the upper-floor neighbours may not want the work to be done, or they may ask for it to be delayed, because of medical reasons. For example, someone living in the flat may be pregnant, or a family member may be very seriously ill. In such a circumstance, HDB will continue to explore other avenues. These include explaining to the lower-floor residents about the predicament of their upper-floor neighbours, and trying to facilitate a mutually agreeable timeframe for repairs. Generally, most lower-floor owners are understanding, and willing to accommodate and postpone the repairs to a later date.
Third, the upper-floor neighbours may not be able to pay for the repair costs due to financial hardship. HDB will continue to help by subsidising 50% of the cost of fixing the leak under the Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) Scheme. If they still face financial difficulty, HDB will arrange for the repairs first and offer them the option of paying for their share of the repair costs by instalments.
To answer Mr Gan Thiam Poh's question on whether owners need to pay for additional investigation costs if the repair works fail to rectify the ceiling leak problem, let me clarify that HDB's investigation is on a goodwill basis, without any charge. Owners will, however, have to bear their share of the repair costs incurred. If the remedial works fail to rectify the problem due to workmanship issue, HDB will still carry out the repairs for the owners without additional charge.
Let me assure Mr Gan, Mr Ang Wei Neng and other Members that HDB will continue its current approach of engaging and persuading both upper- and lower-floor neighbours to reach an understanding, with the help of community leaders. HDB will continue to take the time and effort to understand each case and to work out the best way to resolve the problem. HDB will only apply to Court for a warrant to enter the flat to investigate and do repair, as a last resort, when the upper floor neighbour is clearly unreasonable, and HDB has exhausted all avenues of engagement. The legal powers are not meant to replace, or to short-cut, the current community-based approach of engagement and persuasion.
Ultimately, this is about being good neighbours. I agree with Mr Thomas Chua that the kampong spirit is very important and we need to continue to nurture it in our communities and estates. If neighbours on the upper- and lower-floor can empathise with each other, understand each other's predicament, and reach a mutually-acceptable arrangement to resolve the ceiling leaks, then there will be no need for HDB to exercise these powers to intervene.
Madam, let me continue and wrap up in English. While most residents are understanding and cooperative, there will always be a small handful that is inconsiderate and unreasonable to the concerns of their neighbours downstairs. They cause great inconvenience to their neighbours living on the lower floor. If allowed to persist, the ceiling leaks will worsen and require urgent repairs.
HDB will need legal powers to intervene as a last resort. Because the legal powers are available, like what Mr Mohd Ismail had said, they may send an unambiguous message that HDB will intervene if it really has to. This should prompt action even without the need for HDB to exercise these new powers. This is where and how we hope the new powers can make a difference to significantly reduce the time taken to resolve a small number of protracted ceiling leak cases and bring life to normality for residents who suffer from this.
Mr Ang Wei Neng asked for the number of cases in the past year for which the power of forced entry with warrant would potentially have been applicable. In 2014, HDB had about 30 cases of serious ceiling leaks where upper floor neighbours persistently refused to cooperate despite repeated appeals by HDB and their neighbours. If we had the legal provisions in place then, we may have considered applying for a warrant to enter the flat for some of these cases, but we will never know. Hopefully, with the possibility of HDB entering with a warrant – just a mere possibility – upper floor neighbours will agree to co-operate and we reduce the need for such a course of action.
As Mr Thomas Chua mentioned, do we really need a law to intervene? We need so for a small number of cases but the vast majority of Singaporeans are reasonable, compassionate, understanding of the pains that neighbours go through, and I think that human compassion ought to resolve most of them.
Indeed, as we do not expect a large number of cases, there may not be a need to set up a specialised unit to deal with forced entry cases, which Mr Ang has suggested, but we take his ideas into consideration. What HDB will ensure is that all officers handling such cases are fully trained and adhere strictly to clear, established protocol, with an unambiguous code of conduct, which Er Lee Bee Wah and Mr Mohd Ismail has asked for.
Allow me to elaborate. For cases where the powers are invoked under warrant, first, HDB will give at least 24-hour notice period to the owners or occupiers before proceeding to apply for a court warrant to enter the flat. Mr Mohd Ismail asked if the 24 hours' notice period is too short. Er Lee Bee Wah and Mrs Lina Chiam suggested a longer period of, say, 48 hours and one week respectively. But as these cases actually would not have been fresh cases and HDB and the neighbours would have tried time and time again to ask them to cooperate, to explain the necessity of doing so, actually, 24 hours would have been sufficient notice for them to take action. So, these are not cases that are a bolt out of the blue. They are known cases, dragging on for weeks, months and years.
Second, before entering the flat, the Bill requires the HDB officer to identify himself to the occupant and to show his staff identity card as proof of identity as well as the warrant showing his authority to enter the flat, which Er Lee Bee Wah has also suggested as necessary safeguards.
Third, if asked, the officer will also have to give the occupant a copy of the warrant for records.
And, fourth, the Bill also mandates that at least one HDB officer be present in the flat at all times together with the contractor.
Mr Mohd Ismail suggested that HDB send officers who can speak dialect or ethnic Mother Tongue to communicate with non-English speaking owners or occupiers, especially our elderly. HDB, in fact, already does so, even in the early stages of engagement when seeking the owners' cooperation to enter the flat for checks.
Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Mohd Ismail are concerned about possible impersonation of HDB officers. Mr Mohd Ismail further suggested that HDB provide a hotline for verification of the identity of HDB officials. We fully appreciate their concerns and encourage all residents, especially the elderly, to take precautions by asking to see the original identification card or staff pass of the HDB officers. If flat owners have doubts, they can call the HDB Branch Service Line – this is the hotline that Mr Mohd Ismail suggested – or the Essential Maintenance Services Centre to verify the officer's identity. Now that number can be provided by the HDB Branch officers easily.
HDB will also work with the Police and the local grassroots who currently reach out and educate residents, especially our elderly, about crime prevention and how to guard against imposters trying to get into their homes. So, it is a work that keeps on going. It is work in progress. Let me emphasise that impersonation of HDB officers, or any public officers for that matter, is a very serious offence and will be dealt with sternly under the law.
Er Lee Bee Wah asked about safeguards against accusations of loss or damage to belongings of home owners. Currently, HDB already adopts various safety and security measures when it does upgrading or repair work within flats. It will continue with these measures. HDB will also remind residents to lock up their valuables and be present in the flats when work is being carried out. In fact, the officer will also be there when the contractor is in the unit.
Mrs Lina Chiam has made some suggestions about the need for HDB officers to wear a recording device before entering the flats and that is to safeguard their interests and the interests of the residents. HDB will certainly look into the feasibility of that suggestion.
Mr Ang suggested that HDB adopt the penalty points system used in the Hong Kong Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement. In Hong Kong, the scheme is applicable to public rental housing estate tenants and Interim Housing licensees, as he has also observed. If the tenants receive 16 penalty points within two years under the penalty point system, then the tenancy or licence may be terminated and the resident has to leave. This system may not be immediately applicable to Singapore, as the vast majority of our flats are sold to home owners. But we will, of course, study the best ideas from around the world. Our key objective really is to facilitate entry into the flat to carry out investigation and undertake necessary repairs to alleviate the concerns of neighbours.
Er Lee Bee Wah and Mrs Lina Chiam asked whether HDB's authority to intervene and enter flats can apply in cases of hoarding. The proposed powers in the Bill do not extend to hoarding, but HDB is separately stepping up efforts to better deal with hoarding cases together with other agencies. Currently, when HDB receives feedback on hoarding inside flats, HDB officers will inspect and advise the hoarder to remove the unwanted items, and most residents are cooperative. In some cases, however, the residents may suffer from compulsive hoarding, which is a behavioural or health problem, requiring professional intervention. HDB works with the social workers and grassroots leaders, and in some cases, enforcement agencies, to persuade the hoarder and next-of-kin to clear the clutter and offer assistance if needed.
In the case that Er Lee had mentioned, given the circumstances of that particular case, the National Environment Agency invoked its powers under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act to gain entry into the flat after the Police had removed the body of the deceased, and agencies entered the flat to clean it up. HDB will strengthen coordination amongst agencies, so that the living environment remains safe, the hoarder is able to receive the counselling and support and uncooperative cases do not remain protracted.
I shall now move on to another key amendment, which is to augment HDB's investigation powers. Mr Gan was concerned that these powers could be abused and HDB's residents' privacy affected. Let me take the opportunity to reiterate the rationale for the enhanced investigation powers for cases of lease infringements.
As I said earlier, HDB flats are highly-subsidised and principally meant for owner-occupation. When a flat owner signs the agreement with HDB, they commit to use their flat for its intended purpose. As Er Lee Bee Wah has shared with the House, unfortunately, there are flat owners who blatantly infringe the terms of their lease, such as by illegally subletting their flats, operating an illegal gambling den, hosting vice-related activities and leasing their flats to tourists for short-term basis. These actions pose risks and can cause serious problems for genuine HDB neighbours. When these cases are reported, HDB officers are duty-bound to do fact finding and investigate.
But some flat owners have prevented HDB officers from carrying out their duty, by refusing to grant access to the flat for inspection or refusing to provide the documents that have been asked for. This cannot continue. Hence, it is important that HDB be given appropriate powers to do fact finding and to identify those misuse their public housing flats, in order to ensure a safer and more pleasant living environment for all in our public housing estates.
Nevertheless, HDB will exercise these powers professionally, carefully and with good judgement. In response to Mrs Lina Chiam's concern about whether HDB officers have the expertise, whether they are Arts background or Science background, rest assured that HDB will train its officers, and consult more established enforcement agencies. There are certain skills and certain background that you need to identify certain leaks. I would like to reassure the House that, similar to the powers of forced entry, HDB will only invoke such powers when the owners or occupiers repeatedly hinder HDB officers from carrying out their duties to investigate.
Mdm Speaker, the amendments proposed today will empower HDB to better discharge its duty to build good, affordable public housing and provide a safe and pleasant living environment for all Singaporeans. As Er Lee Bee Wah had very aptly recounted earlier, this is a duty that started 55 years ago, thanks to the vision of our founding Prime Minister, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
When Mr Lee saw the urgent need to provide housing for an overcrowded Singapore, dotted with slums and squatter settlements, he set up the HDB in 1960. When he was convinced that if every family owned its home, the country would be more stable, he launched the "Home Ownership for the People Scheme" in 1964. Fifty years on, HDB flats are home to over 80% of Singapore's resident population and Singapore has achieved, as Er Dr Lee has pointed out, one of the highest home ownership rates in the world.
And to quote Mr Lee: "Housing was and is a most important public policy, one with profound influence on the lives of our people and has moulded the cohesive society we have". Over the years, we have moved from providing simple and utilitarian flats to developing comprehensively planned and integrated modern towns, where residents can comfortably work, live, learn and play. We must continue to build on the proud legacy Mr Lee has left us, to better serve the current and future generations of home owners.

: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. May I ask my supplementary clarification in Mandarin?
:
Minister of State mentioned earlier that if the water leakage problem still persists after repair, then HDB will repair it again free-of-charge. I welcome such a practice. The residents living upstairs may be unwilling to repair the ceiling because they say "I just paid for the repair a few months ago. You are asking me to spend money now on this again!" So, they are rather reluctant. I would like to ask Minister of State whether there is a time limit for this. Is there a certain time period during which if the water leakage problem recurs, HDB will do the repair again for free? This is because water leakage problems may not appear immediately. Sometimes, they may take a few months, or even a year, to appear. That is why I want to ask whether there is a time limit for this.
: Ceiling leaks through wear and tear arise because, over the years, water proofing membrane, the floor, toilets and kitchens wear out, and from time to time will cause problems to units downstairs. When I first started serving in the capacity as a Member of Parliament in 2011, I, too, like many seniors before me in this Chamber, was faced with residents suffering spalling concrete and ceiling leak problems. I think this is a problem all of us encounter from time to time. I did ask engineers of HDB perhaps, "Could you give me a briefing?" And they did give me a briefing as to why these things happen. It is due to the wear and tear of the water-proof membranes.
Sometimes, when residents engage contractors on their own, and this is what we hear anecdotally, they get the job done as quickly as possible because repairing a ceiling leak or spalling concrete requires some time to treat. So, it may take three to four days to identify the source of the spalling concrete and leak, and from the lower units' point of view, you need time to repair, treat the metal, replace the plaster, the concrete and so on. But if you compact that time and if things are done quickly because you do not want to spend the time or you think that is the recommendation of the contractor that you bring in, then invariably, very quickly, you will find that the problem recurs.
The request that the Member had made to provide that certainty, I think we will look at it on a case-by-case basis. But certainly, if from the upstairs units' point of view that they are unwilling because they fear that you will not solve the problem, I think they should rest assured. We will look at the source of the problem. This is scientific but it is not a perfect science. Leaks are small, sometimes, micro and, if it does recur, HDB will look at the situation and render assistance.

asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the changes in the CPF rules (a) why is the rule that a CPF account holder can withdraw 20% of savings from his CPF Retirement Account upon turning 65 years applicable to only those who turn 55 years old in 2013 and not earlier; and (b) what options do older CPF members have should they need to use money from their CPF Retirement Account.
: The new withdrawal rules do not apply to older cohorts because the withdrawal rules for older cohorts were already more generous. CPF members turning 55 in 2008 and earlier would already have been allowed to withdraw 50% of their retirement savings in a lump sum from the age of 55
1
. It would be excessive to now allow these cohorts to withdraw an additional 20% of their retirement savings in a lump sum at 65. Doing so would mean there would be too little left behind in the Retirement Accounts to provide a meaningful payout in retirement.
We tightened the withdrawal rules from 2009 to 2013 to ensure members had sufficient savings set aside for retirement. The withdrawable amount was gradually reduced such that from 2013, CPF members who turned 55 with less than the Minimum Sum, and who did not have property to pledge, could only withdraw the first $5,000 in their CPF accounts.
Most of the CPF changes announced at the Budget/Committee of Supply (COS) this year will apply to new cohorts turning 55 from 2016. In the case of the withdrawal rules, we have allowed cohorts who turned 55 from 2013 to benefit because these cohorts were affected by the tightening of the withdrawal rules. For the cohort who turned 55 in 2012, or in other words, those aged 58 this year, we will allow a withdrawal of 10% of their Retirement Account savings at 65, since they were only allowed to withdraw 10% of their savings from 55. All older members aged 59 and older this year would already have been allowed to withdraw 20% or more of their CPF savings in a lump sum from the age of 55.
asked the Prime Minister (a) what is being done to promote local talent in the financial sector; and (b) whether retrenchments by top US and European banks in the US and Europe are causing Singaporeans to face increased competition for jobs in our financial sector and, if so, what can be done to moderate its impact on local jobseekers and existing employees.
: Many financial institutions have located their global and regional business functions in Singapore. To staff these functions, financial institutions look to build teams with the best mix of talents, so that they can compete globally. This strategy of financial institutions is in Singaporeans’ interests, as it provides them a chance to be in top-quality, globally competitive teams here in Singapore.
At the same time, around the world financial institutions are having to run on leaner structures, both in terms of business lines and geographical footprint. Modest growth prospects, more stringent regulatory requirements and advances in the use of technology, have made financial institutions more cautious in their hiring decisions. These are global trends and no financial centre is spared from the need to adjust and upgrade.
Competition for jobs in every global financial centre is, hence, keen and will continue to be so. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will be doing more to help Singaporeans prepare for this new landscape.
First, developing skills and deep capabilities. As part of the national SkillsFuture initiative, MAS will work with partners like the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF), and with both employers and unions, to provide more learning pathways and training opportunities for Singaporeans in the finance industry. This is a comprehensive effort at every level - from the rank and file to senior professionals and specialists.
- At the entry level, MAS partners financial institutions to provide opportunities for young Singaporean professionals to be groomed through structured developmental programmes.
- To help Singaporeans acquire specialist capabilities in finance, MAS supports financial institutions in providing training opportunities, for example, through the Financial Training Scheme (FTS) and the Finance Scholarship Programme (FSP).
- To develop leadership capabilities. MAS also has several initiatives, such as the International Posting Programme (iPOST) for overseas exposure as well as a new Asian Financial Leaders Programme (AFLP) which will be launched later this year.
Second, MAS will ensure fair employment practices for Singaporeans. MAS has been working closely with the key financial institutions to ensure that they give Singaporeans fair consideration for all roles in their organisations. MAS has engaged the top management of these financial institutions, including at the global level. They have responded positively and assured us of their commitment to merit-based employment practices. They have processes in place to safeguard against any form of discriminatory hiring.
Our aim is, hence, to work with the institutions to develop a continuous pipeline of Singaporean talent, while ensuring a level playing field so that Singaporeans can compete for the jobs offered here.
At the same time, Singaporeans in the industry must take ownership of their own careers and development. We will support them in their journey. MAS will provide maximum opportunities for Singaporeans to equip themselves with the relevant skills and to deepen their expertise. This is how we will ensure a vibrant global financial centre in Singapore, with Singaporeans at its core.
asked the Minister for Communications and Information with regard to "net neutrality" (a) whether Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or network operators are allowed to (i) throttle legitimate Internet content, albeit without rendering them unusable and still remaining above the threshold of IDA's minimum Quality of Service (QoS) requirements; (ii) impose extra charges on consumers or providers of over-the-top (OTT) services like WhatsApp and Skype; and (b) whether there are any plans to introduce net neutrality regulations to prohibit discriminatory network management practices which negatively affect consumers' experience when using legitimate Internet services.
: IDA’s net neutrality policy was developed in 2011 after consultation with the industry and the public. IDA’s policy aims to encourage innovative services by ISPs, while protecting consumers’ interest in enjoying quality Internet access. For example, ISPs in Singapore can manage bandwidth usage during peak hours to ensure that user experiences are generally not affected. Certain applications which take up a lot of bandwidth, such as the exchange of files, may be managed during these periods. However, they are not allowed to block legitimate Internet content altogether.
IDA’s policy also allows ISPs to offer differentiated services tailored to the needs of different users, while complying with IDA’s information transparency, Quality of Service standards and fair competition requirements. These providers must publish their network management policies, so that consumers can make informed choices when selecting a service plan. For example, some ISPs have introduced specialised broadband plans for Internet gamers who desire fewer delays in Internet connection and/or direct connection to gaming servers. We understand that regulators in the US and European Union do not prohibit such practices.
ISPs in Singapore cannot impose extra charges on consumers or providers of over-the-top (OTT) services like WhatsApp and Skype where these harm competition or end-users’ interests.
Since the formalisation of the net neutrality policy, IDA has monitored market practices and has not found any pattern to suggest that ISPs are operating in breach of this policy.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the rationale for requiring spa operators to obtain CaseTrust accreditation if they wish to have their business located in HDB estates; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider relaxing the licensing requirements for spa operators located in HDB estates which serve female clients only.
: Spas are regulated as Massage Establishments (ME) under the ME Act. As MEs have and can be used as fronts for illicit vice activities and cause law and order and social problems, Police’s licensing framework imposes different qualifying criteria and operating conditions for the different types of MEs.
There are three categories of MEs licensed by Police - Category I, Category II and Exempted MEs. Category I MEs are expected to meet high operating standards and have the most stringent qualifying criteria, including the requirement to obtain CaseTrust accreditation. As Category I MEs meet more stringent qualifying criteria, there are fewer restrictions on where they can operate.
Category I MEs are allowed to operate in HDB estates. The higher standards set for such MEs will help to avoid illicit activities and law and order problems in HDB estates.
Operators under the "Exempted ME" category can also apply to operate in HDB estates. This category of MEs has to abide by tighter operating conditions, which include having no partitions or cubicles within the premises, and ensuring that all areas in the premises where massage services are carried out are visible from outside the premises. Any applications under this category must meet these criteria, and are subject to approval.
Under the ME Act, there is no distinction between establishments that claim to serve only male or female clients.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Ministry can consider the establishment of a cap on deposits for the purchase of goods and services to better protect consumers' interests from errant businesses; and (b) what measures has the Ministry taken to prevent errant business owners from setting up another entity to continue their malicious intent.
: The Government’s approach to consumer protection is based on promoting fair trading among retailers, and helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions. The majority of retailers are legitimate businesses who want to serve their customers well.
As the nature of consumer purchases can vary widely in practice, broad-based restrictions, such as imposing a cap on deposits, could have the unintended effect of restricting trade and increasing transaction costs. This will result in greater inconvenience and higher costs for consumers. If there are specific sectors which require additional safeguards to protect consumers’ interests, we are open to working with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) and relevant industry associations to explore possible arrangements.
MTI is currently studying ways to enhance the effectiveness of Singapore’s consumer protection regime, with reference to practices in other jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong and Australia. These will include measures to prevent errant retailers from side-stepping restrictions under the Consumer Protection Fair Trading Act by setting up new business entities. The review will be completed by mid-2015.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) if he can provide an update on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations; (b) when is the Agreement expected to be successfully concluded; (c) what are the key obstacles that need to be overcome; (d) to what extent the TPP is likely to improve market access for Singapore-based firms in US, Japan and other markets; and (e) what are our economic agencies doing to prepare Singapore firms, especially SMEs, to take advantage of the improved market access that a successfully concluded TPP can bring.
: The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is envisioned as a high-quality agreement that will boost regional economic integration and improve market access for our exports. It also serves as a possible pathway towards an eventual Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP).
Significant progress has been made over the past five years of negotiations. All Parties are working hard to conclude negotiations as soon as possible given the economic and strategic importance of this agreement.
Singapore already has bilateral FTAs with nine of the 11 TPP Parties. The additional economic benefit of the TPP will come through enhanced cooperation on regulatory measures, and integration of this region into a single manufacturing base and market. Our businesses will find it easier to operate across all TPP countries, and participate in the global supply chain. Furthermore, common trade facilitation rules across TPP Parties will reduce compliance costs for businesses and generate substantial gains in supply chain efficiency for traders operating across them. These benefits are particularly important for SMEs, which will be able to operate with reduced cost and greater certainty. The TPP will also include disciplines on new growth sectors, such as e-Commerce and Intellectual Property, which will help foster innovation and commercialisation of new insights and discoveries to benefit consumers.
IE Singapore promotes the awareness and utilisation of the various FTAs we have signed among Singapore-based companies, big and small, through both customised and broad-based outreach efforts. These include one-on-one briefings and consultations to companies and industries, as well as seminars co-organised with Trade Associations and Chambers to inform and educate the business community on the benefits of each FTA. There are also a range of capability-building initiatives, such as the FTA Certificate Programme for companies and train-the-trainer sessions for Trade Associations and Chambers. Feedback channels are also open to companies to assist them with FTA implementation issues.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry will consider monthly releases of services exports data so as to provide closer trend indicators as well as to help dampen the effects of fluctuations in monthly goods exports data.
: The Department of Statistics (DOS) currently compiles and releases estimates on services exports on a quarterly basis as part of Singapore’s Balance of Payments statistics. Merchandise exports data are compiled and released by IE Singapore on a monthly basis. The release of services exports data on a quarterly basis and merchandise exports data on a monthly basis is in accordance with the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Merchandise export figures are compiled from administrative data collected from the customs declarations of traders. On the other hand, services export figures are based on surveys of companies, as there are no similar administrative records that can be tapped on.
To minimise compliance cost while keeping with international standards, MTI and DOS do not currently have plans to increase the frequency of surveys of companies to enable monthly compilation of services exports data.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether it is an offence to feed pigeons and cats in the public areas and leave behind the unconsumed food which then forms a potential food source for rodents; (b) if so, how many enforcement actions have been carried out and how many people have been issued with summonses over the past two years; (c) whether the Ministry will carry out a comprehensive study on the infestation of rodents; and (d) what further actions can be taken to control the rodent population.
: Food left on open ground without proper disposal poses a risk to public health. It attracts rodents, cockroaches and other pests. Containers with stagnant water enable mosquitoes to breed.
The feeding of stray pigeons is specifically prohibited under the Animal and Birds (Pigeon) Rules. Pigeons may transmit serious infections including meningitis and encephalitis. Offenders may be fined up to $500. From 2013 to 2014, the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) took enforcement action against 95 offenders for feeding pigeons. Persons who feed other stray animals without clearing leftover food or food containers may be fined up to $2,000 for littering under the Environmental Public Health Act.
AVA and the National Environment Agency (NEA) will continue to work with animal welfare groups to ensure proper stray animal feeding practices. NEA will have to take enforcement action against irresponsible feeders.
Rodents proliferate when there is poor food storage and improper waste management. NEA conducts systematic inspections of public areas, including food establishments and shopping malls, to identify potential food sources, harbourages and rodent burrows. NEA also subsidises the Town Councils’ "Rat Attack" programmes.
All stakeholders must ensure cleanliness of their respective premises, good housekeeping, proper refuse management and comprehensive pest control.
asked the Minister for Health how will the Basic Healthcare Sum, which will be raised every year, affect the quantum of CPF monies that CPF members are allowed to withdraw from their accounts.
: The Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS) is the estimated savings that we need for our basic subsidised healthcare needs in old age. The BHS will need to be adjusted yearly, to keep pace with growth in Medisave, due to inflation and expanding uses of Medisave. This is to ensure that we will have enough savings for our healthcare needs after retirement. Once a person reaches age 65, his BHS will be fixed for the rest of his life.
As there will no longer be a Medisave Minimum Sum with effect from 1 January 2016, a CPF member will no longer need to transfer any monies from his other CPF accounts into the Medisave Account before he can withdraw his CPF monies from the Ordinary and Special Accounts. Therefore, the quantum of CPF monies he can withdraw from his Ordinary and Special Accounts will not be affected by his Medisave balance.
asked the Minister for Health whether he can provide an update on the public consultation exercise on the criteria for pre-abortion counselling.
: The Ministry of Health (MOH) carried out a month-long public consultation exercise in November 2014 on the criteria for pre-abortion counselling. We sought feedback from the public on whether we should extend pre-abortion counselling to all pregnant women seeking termination of pregnancy (TOP) in Singapore. Currently, mandatory pre-abortion counselling only applies to women who satisfy the criteria as set out in the Guidelines on TOP.
Feedback was received through online channels and through focus group discussions with various stakeholders including healthcare professionals, social workers and Non-Governmental Organisations. There was overall support for pre-abortion counselling to be extended to all pregnant women seeking TOP in Singapore so that these women can make an informed decision on whether to undergo an abortion.
MOH will thus be extending pre-abortion counselling to all pregnant women seeking TOP in Singapore, regardless of their nationality, educational status and number of children, with effect from 17 April 2015.
There will be other enhancements made to the pre-abortion counselling programme. First, existing abortion counsellors will be required to attend a refresher course once every two years to update their counselling skills and techniques. The refresher course will also cater to former abortion counsellors who have not been actively providing counselling for the past two years and are keen to resume their services.
Second, MOH will lay out the recommended components of pre-abortion and post-abortion counselling, in the updated Guidelines on Termination of Pregnancy. These components include medical, psychosocial and emotional aspects. Third, we will update the abortion counselling materials to be used during pre-abortion counselling.
MOH conducted a briefing for the abortion institutions on the various enhancements on 7 April 2015. In addition, a summary of the feedback received from the public consultation and the enhancements to be implemented have been put up on the MOH website.
asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the cumulative number of people who have received payments under Eldershield300, Eldershield400 and the Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly (IDAPE) respectively; (b) what is the cumulative number of Eldershield300, Eldershield400 and IDAPE recipients who were deceased before the end of their respective payout periods; and (c) what is the cumulative number of Eldershield300, Eldershield400 and IDAPE recipients who remained in need of assistance beyond their respective payout periods.
: ElderShield is an insurance scheme which provides basic protection against the costs of long-term care arising from severe old-age disability. It helps patients who are unable to perform at least three out of six Activities of Daily Living
2
cope with the co-payment for the cost of long-term care, after Government subsidy.
The current scheme, ElderShield400, pays out $400 per month for a maximum of six years, while those who were enrolled in ElderShield before September 2007 and had not opted to upgrade would be on the older ElderShield300, with a $300 monthly payout for a maximum of five years. For those who were unable to join ElderShield when it was launched in 2002
3
, they would be covered under a Government assistance scheme, the Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly (IDAPE), if they meet the income criteria.
Since 2002, 9,200 claimants have received payouts under ElderShield300, 1,700 claimants have received payouts under ElderShield400 and 14,400 have received IDAPE payouts. Claims are expected to grow significantly in the future, as the population ages.
The payout period is sufficient to cover most ElderShield and IDAPE claims, with about 70% of all claimants fully covered until they pass away.
Those who live beyond their ElderShield and IDAPE payout periods may continue to receive Government subsidies for long-term care, if they are eligible. Subsidies for nursing home care, home care and community care services were enhanced in 2012, and the qualifying income raised to benefit middle-income households. In 2014, the Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme was introduced to provide an additional help of $1,200 per year to Pioneers who are moderately or severely disabled. As part of MOH’s efforts to improve affordability of long-term care, we will also be reviewing ElderShield and other long-term care financing schemes.
asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the recent spate of breakdowns of SMRT trains within a span of a few days (a) whether there will be a thorough review of the MRT train maintenance programme; (b) how does the frequency of our train breakdowns compare with other cities like Hong Kong or London; and (c) whether the Ministry will look at other ways of motivating SMRT to improve its service delivery apart from just imposing hefty fines whenever there is a breakdown.
: The recent spate of disruptions is regrettable given the inconvenience it caused commuters, and also because train reliability has actually seen significant improvements in recent times. The number of delays lasting more than five minutes on the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) has steadily declined from its peak of 1.8 per 100,000 train-km in 2011 to 1.3 in 2014, an improvement of more than 25% in three years. The current delay rate is more than twice as good as New York City’s rail lines, but we can do better, as there are other systems, such as in Hong Kong, that have fewer delays.
I had instructed LTA and SMRT to get to the bottom of the recent disruptions. Meanwhile, SMRT has announced that they will thoroughly review and strengthen their maintenance regime, including setting up a Maintenance Operations Centre, increasing engineering resources, and training ground staff to handle minor maintenance issues so that problems can be resolved more promptly. LTA will step up audits of SMRT’s rail maintenance resources and processes. LTA will also support with engineering expertise as part of the Joint Team’s continuing efforts to improve train reliability.
asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will consider allowing Singaporeans driving Malaysian-registered vehicles to enter Singapore on Fridays after 6.00 pm without utilising their 28-weekday provision.
: As a concession, on a case-by-case basis, Singaporeans working and residing in Malaysia are already allowed to use their Malaysia-registered vehicles in Singapore for up to 28 weekdays a year, in addition to Saturdays, Sundays and Singapore public holidays. Such restrictions are necessary so that ownership of foreign-registered vehicles does not become a means to circumvent our vehicle ownership policies, and so that we are fair to Singaporeans who own Singapore-registered vehicles.
asked the Minister for Education (a) what are the outcomes and learnings of the Junior Sports Academy programme to date; (b) what is the basis for selecting the sports included in the programme; (c) whether the Ministry intends to extend the programme to all schools and students in the future; (d) what is the popularity or take-up rate of the programme to date; and (e) what is needed from other stakeholders to enable the Ministry to extend the programme's outreach, effectiveness and success.
: The Junior Sports Academies (JSAs) for primary school students were set up in 2008 to systematically identify and nurture young sporting talents in our schools. To date, more than 2,200 students have participated in the JSAs.
The JSAs have provided opportunities for students to train and learn with peers of similar sporting ability and to help each other improve their game. Beyond the deepening of sports skills and knowledge, students have also made new friends passionate in sports, from other schools. The programme enables students to practise values, such as discipline, teamwork and responsibility, which can be transferred to other learning contexts.
The revised JSA programme will provide deeper and broader sports development opportunities for budding sporting talents across all primary schools. In particular, this programme caters to students with high natural ability in the physical domain, but who may not have prior access to sport-specific training.
The revised JSA has been developed based on our research of studies and best practice around the world. It takes a long term and holistic view to athlete development. To enable students to explore, discover and develop their areas of sports interests and strengths, the revised JSA programme comprises two main components – Sports Modules, and Sports Education Modules. Students will choose and participate in a total of four sports, over two years. They will also attend workshops that focus on various aspects of athlete development, such as mental skills and fitness conditioning, to prepare them for future sporting development.
For a start, around 400 Primary 4 students will be selected from across all primary schools to join the programme.
Twelve
4
sports will be offered in 2015. At steady state, students will have the option to choose sports modules from 28 sports in the National School Games for secondary schools. This is to provide developmental pathways for students to continue their sport development at the secondary school level.
MOE will conduct workshops for parents and coaches to understand how they can complement this programme. With the support from parents, coaches and the respective National Sports Associations, graduands of the programme will be equipped with a strong foundation as they continue to pursue sports beyond the primary schools.
asked the Minister for Manpower whether he can provide an update on the investigations into the worksite incident on 24 February 2015 involving a crawler crane that had fallen into a house compound along Pheng Geck Avenue in Sennett Estate.
: On 24 February 2015, a crawler crane toppled and fell into a house compound along Pheng Geck Avenue. Investigation on the incident is currently on-going to establish the cause of the incident.
Following the incident, MOM had issued a stop work order for the work site. A full site inspection was conducted to identify and correct any unsafe work practices, and to review all lifting plans and procedures to ensure that they are adequate. The stop work order was subsequently lifted on 2 March 2015 when all the safety requirements imposed were fully complied.
MOM had also required the contractor to engage an Authorised Examiner, who is a Professional Engineer, to conduct a thorough inspection on all cranes on site to ensure that they are in good working condition. The Authorised Examiner had inspected and certified that the tower crane on site is safe for use. As for mobile and crawler cranes, MOM has disallowed their use on site until the contractor formulates a robust risk management plan, and affirms that these cranes can be positioned such that any failure will be contained within the boundaries of the site and not affect residents in the surrounding areas.
MOM is concerned with the recent spate of crane-related incidents. Since the start of 2015, there were seven
5
crane-related incidents compared to one in the same period last year.
To emphasise the importance of crane safety, MOM will be stepping up enforcement efforts. An enforcement operation targeting mobile and tower crane operations was conducted nationwide from 16 March to 2 April 2015 to arrest unsafe work practices involving cranes.
The industry has also indicated its commitment to keep our employees and general public safe. The WSH Council National Crane Safety Taskforce, Singapore Contractors Association Ltd (SCAL) and Singapore Crane Association (SCA), have jointly taken the lead to encourage their members to participate in a "Safety Time Out" (STO) which was held from 9 to 15 March 2015. During this STO, contractors and users of lifting equipment, especially tower and mobile cranes, took time off from their routine operations to take stock and review the measures in place to ensure safety.
asked the Minister for Manpower for each year since 2005 (a) how many CPF members have successfully applied for CPF withdrawals on each of the following medical grounds: (i) permanently incapacitated from ever continuing in any employment (ii) terminally ill with a life expectancy of 12 months or less (iii) suffering from a severely shortened life expectancy (iv) mentally incapable of handling and receiving monies (v) other reasons; (b) what is the proportion of successful applications which have been granted a full CPF withdrawal; and (c) how many applications have been rejected.
: CPF members with serious medical conditions can apply for an early withdrawal of CPF savings under the CPF Medical Grounds Scheme. The current scheme was introduced in July 2006, and there are four grounds for qualifying under the scheme. Members who wish to make withdrawals on any of these grounds will need to have their medical conditions certified by a doctor either from a public medical institution or the CPF Board’s panel. Members who are terminally ill will be able to withdraw their retirement savings in full. Members who are permanently incapacitated from ever continuing in any employment, suffer from an unsound mind or have a severely reduced lifespan will be able to withdraw their retirement savings after setting aside a reduced Retirement Sum at the point the application is granted.
The number of CPF members who have successfully applied for CPF withdrawals under the Medical Grounds Scheme since 2007 is as follows:
About two-thirds of applications between 2007 and 2014 under the Medical Grounds Scheme were successful. The remaining applications were rejected as the applicants were unable to provide the required certification from the approved doctors.
