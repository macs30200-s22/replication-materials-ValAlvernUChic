asked
the Prime Minister (a) whether the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee has been formed and, if so, who are the members of the Committee; (b) if not, when will it be formed; (c) when will the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's report be published; and (d) what is the likely duration from the publication of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's report to the calling of a general election.
:
Mdm Speaker, with your permission, I would take Question Nos 1 and 2 together.
:
Yes, please.
: Mdm Speaker, the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) was formed two months ago. I have asked the Committee in its review to:
a) Consider the population shifts and housing developments since the last boundary delineation exercise;
b) Have smaller Group Representation Constituencies, so as to reduce the average size of the Group Representation Constituencies below five; and
c) Have at least 12 Single Member Constituencies.
As per past practice, the Committee is chaired by the Secretary to Prime Minister. It is now in the midst of its deliberations and will make its recommendations to me when it is ready.
: I thank the Prime Minister for the answer. I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether he is prepared to commit a minimum time period, say, at least six months from the publishing of the EBRC report to the calling of elections. I believe that it had been as short as one day from the report to the calling of elections in the past. A longer period would allow residents being moved out of their constituencies to be able to adjust to the changes.
The second question I have is on the composition of the EBRC for future Committees. Prior to Singapore's Independence, the members have comprised of people that are outside of the Government, including representatives from various political parties. So, I would like to check with the Prime Minister whether in subsequent EBRCs we can change the composition of the EBRC to involve non-Government representatives or for it to be chaired by a High Court judge like in the case of the UK.
Finally, I would like to ask the Prime Minister: the completeness of the EBRC report seems to have been shrinking from the 1960s and the early 1970s. So, will the Prime Minister direct the Committee to provide better justifications for the changes because many of these changes do not seem to make sense to political observers and to the residents? Can the minutes of meetings of the EBRC be published so that they will be open for all to understand the decisions that have been made? Thank you.
: Mdm Speaker, I think that the Committee will publish its report and to the maximum extent possible, we will make sure that there is enough time to elapse so that everybody can read the report, understand it and know where they stand before elections are called. But I do not think it is possible to say that we promise a certain minimum period, such as six months, because it depends very much on the exigencies of the situation, and on when elections become necessary.
Secondly, on the composition of the EBRC, the EBRC has for many years comprised civil servants who have domain knowledge which enable them to make considered decisions on how to divide up the constituencies, taking into account, as I have said, population shifts, housing developments and also to do this in a practical sort of way so that you do not have a complete upheaval each time you have re-demarcation. If there is a need for outside expertise, I think that can be considered and they will have no hesitation to look for outside expertise. As for bringing political parties in, I am not sure that is an entirely good idea. The Americans do it with political parties, and the way it is done is that the sitting members – this is for the House of Representatives – the members decide on the demarcations. Usually, what happens is that they carve it up amongst themselves. It is a political deal. I think that is not a good arrangement. I think it is best we leave it to the civil servants to work at.
As for the completeness of the report and of the minutes, I think I have to leave it to the Committee. I do not believe that it is helpful to have every twist and turn in the minutes reported and published. I think the Committee's report is the final word.
asked
the Minister for Manpower whether the Employment Pass (EP) and Jobs Bank schemes can be further tightened to ensure that employers are required to give due consideration to applications from qualified Singaporeans first and that EP applications must be accompanied by evidence that the hiring of foreigners is only after unsuccessful sourcing from local talent pool.
: Mdm Speaker, to ensure that companies give fair consideration to Singaporeans when hiring, the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) and Jobs Bank were introduced. So far, almost 20,000 employers have registered more than 72,000 active job postings with the Jobs Bank, drawing 110,000 local job seekers to register as well.
On the whole, it has led to a fairer hiring process and easier access to job opportunities. Notwithstanding this, MOM is making further enhancements to send a clearer and stronger signal about fair consideration for Singaporeans. As announced last week, we are making further refinements to take effect from 1 October 2015. This includes publishing the salary ranges of job vacancies, closer scrutiny of EP applications for companies with a weaker Singaporean core relative to others in their industry, and more stringent quality assessment of EP and S Pass applicants.
For example, companies with weaker Singaporean core will be required to provide additional information, such as the number of applications from Singaporeans, how many were shortlisted, and the interview outcomes. We may also require some of them – what I call the "double weak", weak Singaporean core and weak commitment to fair consideration for Singaporeans – to commit to plans to strengthen their Singaporean core.
Working together in partnership with the industry, agencies and the Labour Movement, our four core priorities are (a) to strengthen our competitiveness and sustainability, (b) by becoming more manpower lean, (c) with a stronger Singaporean core, and (e) better quality foreign manpower. These are important priorities as we reposition our economy for future growth.
: Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for the slew of enhanced measures announced last week to strengthen the Singaporean core amongst PMEs, especially the Career Support scheme. Madam, I have two supplementary questions for the Minister.
Number one, with the intention to scrutinise EP applications for whether or not Singaporeans were fairly considered, would the Minister please elaborate how the Ministry will ensure qualified Singaporeans are not passed over for jobs just because foreigners are willing to accept a lower salary and employers do not need to contribute to their CPF?
Number two, in MOM's announcement, it mentioned an expectation for firms to systematically develop their Singaporean PMEs. So, that was a statement. That was great. Would the Minister please elaborate how MOM intends to achieve this and whether the Minister would consider a system where the approval of selected EPs are tied to a localisation plan, with clear commitments from the firms to invest in the training and development of Singaporeans to fill these jobs in the future? This scheme will be especially helpful in sectors currently dominated by foreigners.
: Mdm Speaker, I was at Geneva last month to attend the International Labour Organization Conference. The Director-General of the ILO Mr Guy Ryder hosted a dinner for the manpower representatives of the G20 countries. We are not a G20 country but I was invited because Singapore is an observing country for this year's G20 Meeting to be held in Turkey. The manpower representatives from these countries discussed the challenges faced in the areas of jobs and employment. My conclusion is that countries all over the world including the G20 countries, the more developed countries, will all face three challenges. Firstly, jobs deficit – not enough jobs in many countries, leading to high unemployment including youth unemployment. Secondly, skills deficit – not enough skills in the workforce, leading to structural unemployment; structural mismatch, again in many countries. Last but not least, quality deficit – jobs are being created but not of good enough quality; as a result, many PMEs are being under-employed. These are the three key challenges facing all countries including Singapore.
I would say that if you look at today's situation, we are today doing much better compared to many other countries. We do not have a severe youth unemployment challenge. Unemployment rate among our PMEs is one of the lowest in the world, at about 2.6% to 2.7%. Under-employment, we have been able to create good-paying jobs in sufficient number for our people. For example, if you come to our Jobs Bank, of the 72,000 vacancies I talked about, more than half of them are PMET jobs; in fact, about 50,000 of them. In other words, we do not really have the three deficits as faced by many of these countries.
As we move forward, as I had mentioned earlier, we do want to strengthen the Singaporean core to ensure that all sectors of the economy can sustain growth into the future. Therefore, whatever measures that we introduce, we must bear in mind, firstly, it must not weaken our competitiveness so that we can continue to create enough good paying jobs; secondly, continue to strengthen the capability, the skill profile of our local workforce so that we do not have the structural unemployment challenge.
In other words, as we move forward, we are identifying, in particular, two target groups. The first would be companies with a weak Singaporean core relative to the rest of the industry. As I had mentioned earlier, for this type of companies, I have no choice but to make the employment of EP holders for these companies more difficult. Because if they have a weak Singaporean core relative to the rest of industry, and at the same time, they do not demonstrate stronger commitment towards fairer consideration, I would have no choice but to make the process more difficult until they are prepared to work together with us to find ways to strengthen the Singaporean core.
There is another consideration. We noticed that in some sectors, the overall Singaporean core is relatively weaker than in other sectors. For those sectors, MOM will work very closely with the relevant economic agencies to understand better why is it that for these sectors, the Singaporean core, on the whole, is relatively weaker than the other sectors. We will work with the economic agencies to see what more can we do under the SkillsFuture initiative led by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman to enhance the skills upgrading of the manpower, sector by sector. Hopefully, over time, while with one hand we strengthen the supply of local Singaporean core through SkillsFuture, at the same time, through the Fair Consideration Framework to strengthen the demand for a Singaporean core. We believe this is the best way forward.
:
Madam, I wish the Minister to clarify how successful has the Fair Consideration Framework been in having Singaporeans considered fairly for PME jobs since its implementation a year ago.
: Mdm Speaker, the requirement to advertise jobs with the Jobs Bank was introduced in August last year. So, it has been implemented for almost a year. The MOM has looked at the overall picture. We are happy to say that, by and large, most employers do show enough commitment, in terms of giving Singaporean job applicants fair consideration.
However, we have noticed that there is a small group of employers, as I had mentioned earlier, whose current Singaporean core is not as strong, relative to the rest of the industry. Of greater concern to us is that they do not seem to demonstrate enough commitment to fair consideration. For example, some of them, the moment they fulfil the 14 days' commitment, within a week, they will come to MOM to submit their EP applications. So, these are the cases which we wonder whether they have really gone through the proper process because we do not believe that they can clear the queue of applications and interviews all within a few days.
Another very common feedback that we receive is that many of the Singaporean PMEs have this feeling that some organisations, because the HR directors are foreigners, as a result, they are giving preferential consideration to foreign PMEs especially those coming from the same countries. MOM takes this seriously. In fact, this is an area I am looking into as well, trying to identify companies where the Directors of HR are foreigners and, at the same time, there is a high concentration of EPs from the same country sources. I am not accusing them of being biased, but I would just like to convince myself whether this concern by many PMEs is founded or unfounded. If they are founded, then obviously, as I had mentioned earlier, this will be companies that we would like to work with closely to ensure that they exercise fairer and more progressive HR policies and practices.
:
Madam, a clarification. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Singaporean core in a company will now be a factor in considering applications for Employment Passes.
:
Mdm Speaker, the answer is yes. As I had mentioned earlier, we are now targeting companies with this "double weak": weak in Singaporean core relative to industry, and at the same time, do not demonstrate a strong enough commitment to give Singaporean workers fair consideration.
:
Thank you, Madam. Madam, I welcome this new initiative by MOM to consider the Singaporean core in the company. I would like to ask how MOM determines whether a company has a weak or strong Singaporean core, and how does the new factor or framework of Singaporean core in a company work into the application for Employment Pass and in consideration of approval by MOM.
: Mdm Speaker, as I had mentioned earlier, the strength or weakness of a Singaporean core in a particular company, on the part of the MOM, we will look at it within the context of the industry. For example, if in the industry, the Singaporean core is "x" percent, but for companies where the Singaporean core is a lot lower than "x" percent, those will be the ones that we perceive as having a weak Singaporean core.
Secondly, as I had mentioned earlier, before they can apply for an EP under the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), the company will have to advertise the job and, now, including the salary as well, in our Jobs Bank. After the 14 days, Singaporean job applicants who are interested in those jobs would have applied for the jobs. What we are doing, moving forward, is that for companies with a weak Singaporean core, we will be asking them questions like, for example, "How many job applications did you receive?" For example, if they do not receive enough job applicants, it could mean that either the jobs are not attractive or maybe there is a shortage of skills in Singapore. That is where, under the Sectoral Manpower Development Plan, we will find ways to strengthen the Singaporean core. So, that is the answer.
: Thank you, Madam. I would like to ask the Minister on the point that he made about being able now to identify situations where there is this "double weak". The Minister mentioned earlier that for companies with a weak Singaporean core, MOM will monitor them and then they may be required to impose tighter EP hiring restrictions. I agree that that sounds like a very good system. What it sounds to me is that the Ministry of Manpower is beginning to exploit the potential for using the Jobs Bank as an early warning kind of monitoring system so that you can see areas where there may be issues with hiring in future. One of the key challenges the Minister mentioned earlier was skills deficit. Would it be possible, do you foresee using this system to identify where a skills deficit may develop in time, even though there is not a skills deficit currently at this point in time?
Secondly, if you are able to accurately develop a system so that it can capture this kind of information for your own use, would you be expecting companies to find this information helpful in the future?
: Mdm Speaker, the answer is yes. In fact, we believe that by a closer analysis of the Jobs Bank as well as the response rate, we would be able to identify any early signs of a skills deficit. When those are identified, firstly, we will share the information with the sector. We do have more than 20 Sectoral Tripartite Committees set up to look into the manpower development plan, sector by sector. So, those information will be shared with the tripartite partners.
At the same time, MOM will also be looking into how we can support those companies that are able to help us to transfer the know-how, the capabilities, to our workforce over the near term. For example, if we have identified that certain areas of skills are in significant deficit, and if we feel those sources of expertise are available out there somewhere in the world, we would like to work with companies to bring those expertise to Singapore and put in place a know-how transfer programme so that, over time, this skills deficit can be narrowed.
:
Mdm Speaker, I applaud the measures that the Minister has introduced. I am equally sure that there several companies or corporations which have developed a strong Singaporean core. So, I wonder whether the Minister could also find ways to recognise and publicise them, and also get them to share the stories of how a strong Singaporean-core has helped them in their business. I am looking more at the more positive parts as well. I think this will be useful.
:
Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for this suggestion. In fact, what the Ministry of Manpower intends to do is to, on the one hand, take firmer action against the "double weak" employers and, at the same time, exactly as mentioned by the Member, to profile companies that are adopting the more progressive, not just fair, but progressive employment practices. We do intend to conduct a series of what we call "Learning Journeys", so that the agencies, companies from the same industry, can learn from the progressive practices of the good employers, so to speak.
:
Mr Zainudin Nordin, last question.
:
Madam, I am very supportive of the Singaporean-core initiative. But on the other hand, I would just like to understand better if all these efforts of getting the EP are making the employers' job more onerous and more difficult, and whether there is a change in image about Singapore being a friendly country for investments, and also, in the long term, whether it will have an impact on us being a more competitive economy, compared to the regional countries which are also developing.
: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for pointing this out. It is a very important point. Let me emphasise again, I mentioned earlier about making the application for EP more difficult, but it is only for the "double weak" employers. Based on MOM's observations, the vast majority of the employers are progressive and they do give fair consideration to Singaporeans. Therefore, only a small group of employers will be affected. We are also engaging them in a positive way. So far, in the last 10 months or so, we have identified about 150 employers belonging to this category of either "single weak" or "double weak", and we are working very closely with them, in some cases, through the relevant economic agencies, and in others between MOM and these companies.
I fully agree that it is important that we continue to maintain the competitiveness and the attractiveness of Singapore, because otherwise we are going to have a jobs deficit challenge. Therefore, I want to assure the business community that we will always be friendly towards employers that adopt fair and progressive employment practices.
asked

asked
the Minister for Education whether he will consider giving a posthumous national award such as the Medal of Valour to the late Mohammad Ghazi and the late Terrence Sebastian Loo in recognition of the teachers' acts of bravery and selflessness in rescuing children during the Sabah earthquake in June 2015.
(for the Minister for Education)
:
Mdm Speaker, the Minister for Education will be making a Ministerial Statement following Question Time. May we have your permission to address the issues that Members have raised in Question Nos 4 to 6 during his Ministerial Statement?
:
I agree. Mr Gerald Giam, next question.
asked
the Minister for Manpower (a) what accounts for the drastic fall in job growth from 28,300 jobs in Q1 2014 and 40,700 jobs in Q4 2014 to just 300 jobs in Q1 2015; (b) whether this trend has continued into Q2 2015; and (c) what implications does this have on Singapore's economy.
: Mdm Speaker, after five years of strong increases, total employment fell by 6,100 in the first quarter of this year compared to the growth of 28,300 a year ago in the first quarter of 2014, and 40,700 in the fourth quarter of last year. This is due to seasonal declines and sharper moderation in employment growth in the manufacturing and construction sectors, as well as parts of the services sector: retail, real estate services, accommodation and food services.
The moderation in employment growth needs to be seen in the context of our labour market and the repositioning of our economy. First, we have seen a sustained increase in our employment rate, to a high of 79.7% last year. In fact, at 79.7%, we are now among the highest, together with Japan. Our unemployment rate has remained low in the last few year, and, in fact, continues to be among the lowest in the world. Local workforce growth, going forward, will be slower, given that we have one of the highest employment rates and lowest unemployment rate in the world.
Secondly, job vacancies remain high and outnumber jobseekers. The seasonally adjusted ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons remains stable at 143 openings per 100 jobseekers in March this year, compared to 142 in December 2014. In other words, we have more job vacancies than the number of people looking for jobs.
Thirdly, to sustain growth, we are moving forward towards a more manpower-lean economy. We will continue to encourage businesses to reduce their reliance on labour, especially low-skilled foreign workers. We will also focus more on upgrading the skills of our local manpower, and improving productivity and increasing the pace of innovation as the source of future growth and competitiveness.
Employment data for the second quarter of 2015 is not yet available. We are monitoring the employment trends closely in the coming quarters.
:
Madam, I thank the Minister for the answers. I have three supplementary questions. Firstly, the Minister mentioned that this is due to seasonal drops in job creation. But this is a 99% drop from the same period a year ago. So, how does the Minister explain this drastic drop, assuming that it is the same season a year ago? Secondly, does the situation of high vacancies, coupled with low unemployment and low job creation, indicate that many companies are not restructuring fast enough to become less labour-intensive and more productive, or what other explanations could account for this situation? Thirdly, is most of the employment creation occurring in the tradable or the non-tradable sectors? What are the proportions of job vacancies in the tradable and the non-tradable sectors?
: Madam, the first point I want to emphasise is that there is a saying that a point is a point, two points make a line, three points make a trend. Therefore, I would not draw any conclusion just based on one point. At the same time, I would emphasise that even though with a decline of 6,100 jobs in the first quarter of 2015, compared to a year ago, there are still many more jobs available in the first quarter of 2015, compared to a year ago, in the first quarter of 2014. In fact, the increase over this year-on-year was about 2.7%, almost 90,000 jobs. Therefore, jobs deficit is not the issue facing us today. The job market is still growing on the year-to-year basis.
Secondly, the Member asked whether this is a sign that the industry is not restructuring fast enough. There is a contradiction. On the one hand, we are concerned that the job growth has slowed down and yet at the same time, we are concerned that the restructuring is not fast enough. In fact, with a faster pace of restructuring, we can expect job growth to slow down even further. Therefore, I would not adopt just one point and draw any conclusion. But over the next quarter, and over a few quarters, we will be monitoring very closely the job growth trend. From there, I would be able to draw a better conclusion regarding the pace of restructuring. But I am happy to say that having tightened the foreign manpower growth and at the same time with the high employment rate and low unemployment rate, I must say that on the ground, we have seen more sectors, more companies embarking on this journey of restructuring.
Thirdly, the question about whether these are tradable or non-tradable sectors, I would say that it cuts across all sectors. We do notice that for the manufacturing sector, which is a mainly export-oriented sector, the pace of restructuring is a lot faster. As a result, the manufacturing sector has become a lot more manpower lean, compared to the services sector. But for the service sector, both the tradable and non-tradable sectors, are taking in more manpower on the whole, not on quarterly basis; but if you look at it, over the past one year.
:
Thank you, Madam. I want to thank the Minister for those clarifications. I think one of the reasons why there has been so much interest surrounding those figures – a sudden drop in employment – is that it had been so sharp. One of the concerns with interested observers is whether this is a sign that we may have overdone the manpower tightening. Can I ask Minister whether he thinks that there will be enough warning signs if the overtightening has been overdone?
: Mdm Speaker, as I have mentioned, I will not jump to any particular conclusion just based on one quarter outcome. We must look at it over a period of a few quarters. The job growth in Singapore indeed was strong. As I had said, compare the first quarter 2015, compared to a year ago, there are now another 90,000 jobs available. Our manpower growth was 2.7%.
Now, is a 2.7% growth over one year overdone? I do not think so. I still remember that, in fact, as we tightened the foreign manpower quota, there was a call in this House that we should go for a complete stop in terms of the importation of work permit holders. I think that would be overdone. But what we have done was to slow down the growth but yet at the same time, manage the process of transition, in a way that, hopefully, will enable more and more companies, especially the SMEs, to adapt and to grow. It is not to our interest to see a sudden drop and to see a sudden decline in our economic activity in Singapore.
: Thank you, Madam. I have just two more supplementary questions. I agree with the Minister's point that one point should not be used to measure a trend. So, in line with what I asked in my question, what would be the job growth figures in quarter two of 2015? Are those numbers available yet?
Secondly, regarding the tradable and non-tradable sectors, if I understand the Minister right, he was saying that the productivity growth has been more successful in the manufacturing and other export sectors. Can I conclude that vacancies are growing more in the non-tradable sectors? And if so, if there is a high number of vacancies in the non-tradable sector, how would the shortage of foreign labour damage the economy because of the shortage and the vacancies in the non-tradable sector? Because for the non-tradable sector, the demand is domestic, the demand is not going anywhere. So, for non-productive companies in the non-tradable sectors, they will be forced to restructure or they would be replaced by others who can meet that demand. So, in some ways, the disruption for the non-tradable sector, due to foreign labour shortfalls, would be self- correcting, would it not be?
: Mdm Speaker, the flash estimate for employment in the second quarter 2015 will come out by the end of this month. Right now, I do not have any information to share. Secondly, in terms of vacancies, I think the Member is correct, that the non-tradable sectors are the ones facing greater constraints with manpower. For example, many of our F&B, many of our SMEs are involved in non-tradable sector. For these sectors, I have been in close contact with them, because to go back to the old growth formula of heavy dependency on more work permit holders is not a solution. At the end of the day, we do need to find ways to sustain our economic growth, our workforce growth in a more sustainable manner.
MOM is working with them to help them to look at where they are today, and where they think ought to be three years from now. In other words, as we go through this economic re-positioning, it should apply to all sectors, whether they are tradable or non-tradable. I am happy to say that a sum of these non-tradable sectors has responded positively. Some of them have given us a proposal to say this is where we are today and this is where I want to be three years from now; and in between from here to there, what kind of support would be needed, whether it is the various financial grants and so on. The Ministry of Manpower is working very closely with SPRING and the relevant agencies to look for ways to help them to go through this transition.
So, in other words, to go back to the past is not a solution because it just pushes back in our push for re-positioning. Looking forward, certainly, we are going to continue to be creative, continue to find win-win outcomes for the agencies, for the companies and for the unions as well.
:
Mdm Speaker, there have been some proposals made by some quarters to freeze foreign manpower growth. So, I would like to ask the Minister what would had been the impact on companies and the economy if such proposals to freeze manpower growth had been implemented?
:
Mdm Speaker, I would not be able to give a quantitative response. But in my course of interaction with many companies, especially SMEs, I would say that even though we have continued to allow the work permit holders to continue to grow at a slower pace, I think already, many of them are facing a lot of constraints. Therefore, on reflection, we did the right thing. We did the right thing by not freezing, not suddenly freezing the importation of work permit holders.
asked
the Minister for Health whether the public using cards issued under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) and Pioneer Generation programme could be kept informed of the subsidy that they have enjoyed and the balance of subsidies for the year as a means to check against any fraudulent claims.
(for the Minister of Health)
: Mdm Speaker, currently, patients on the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), including Pioneers, can check the subsidy that they have enjoyed for chronic medical conditions, and their annual balance, through the CHAS website or by calling the CHAS hotline. As the subsidy limits for chronic diseases are refreshed yearly, this enables patients to monitor their usage of the subsidy to date and check their available balance.
Each of us – the Ministry of Health, CHAS clinics as well as the patients – has a role to play to ensure accountability and prevent fraudulent claims. MOH encourages patients to check with their clinics on any queries they may have on the treatment and charges and to request for itemised receipts, so that they are more informed. MOH also closely monitors the CHAS subsidy claims submitted by clinics, and takes feedback on potential cases of abuse seriously. We will continue to improve the access to relevant information and strengthen our audit system.
:
I would like to ask the Minister of State, given the profile of the CHAS members and PG members, checking the website or even calling the hotline may not be something that is very accessible or something that they are used to. Is it possible, to minimise wastage or a lot of admin work, for the Ministry to provide yearly updates, consolidated accounts of the subsidy the members have enjoyed and the treatments that have been taken, so that they are kept abreast of what subsidy they have? And in the other scenario where there are General Practitioners (GPs) who put in bogus additional treatments on top of a genuine consultation, for example, I think that there needs to be a better way to check against this and prevent abuse of the two schemes.
:
Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Baey Yam Keng for his suggestion. MOH is aware that there is a growing suggestion and request for other modalities to check the balances. In our review, we will take into considerations some of these suggestions that have been given to us and we will try our best to make it seamless and easy, especially for the elderly.
:
I would just like to ask the Minister of State: there has been a suggestion that perhaps because of a good guideline to CHAS participant clinics to add in the remaining balance on the CHAS accounts as part of the itemised bills. I note that some clinics do give some information to the patients but this is not across the board. And I was wondering whether MOH could consider giving some sort of advisory to this effect.
:
Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Dr Chia Shi-Lu for that suggestion as well. There are other measures being explored to enhance the pricing transparency to patients and accountability of the clinics for their charges. While it is currently not mandatory for clinics to issue itemised receipts, MOH is looking at these suggestions to make this mandatory for all licensed clinics as part of our review of the Private Hospitals & Medical Clinics (PHMC) Act and Regulations.
asked
the Minister for Health whether there are plans for a nationwide emergency preparedness exercise to strengthen Singapore's capacity to manage the disruption that MERS will pose should the contagion reach our shores.
10
asked
the Minister for Health whether adequate measures have been taken by the health authorities to ensure that all visitors from countries affected by MERS are properly screened before they are allowed entry into Singapore.
:
Mdm Speaker, can I take both questions together?
:
Yes please.
: Madam, the Ministry of Health has been closely monitoring the global situation of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) since the disease emerged in 2012. WHO's current assessment is that the transmission of the disease is mainly among households and hospital contacts, and there is no evidence of sustained community transmission. Nevertheless, we must remain vigilant to the possibility and the impact of an imported case from the Middle East, South Korea or elsewhere.
There has been very close inter-ministry coordination and planning to prepare for such an incident. An Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), co-chaired by Minister Chan Chun Sing and myself, has been formed since late last year to oversee whole-of-government preparedness against dangerous infectious diseases including MERS and Ebola.
We have taken a multi-pronged approach and have put in place various measures to detect imported MERS-CoV cases and contain any further transmission in Singapore. Our first line of defense is on prevention and detection, through public education, border screening, and vigilance among the medical community.
Let me elaborate on some of the measures. As part of public education efforts, MOH has a dedicated webpage on MERS-CoV and has published a set of FAQs to help Singaporeans understand the disease and advise them on the precautionary measures they can take to protect themselves.
At our borders, MOH has been issuing health advisories to travellers going to countries with active transmission of MERS-CoV including the Middle East and South Korea. In addition, travellers arriving from MERS-affected countries are given individual health advisories on the symptoms of the illness they should look out for and they are advised to seek immediate medical treatment if they have such symptoms. They are also reminded to inform the healthcare professionals of their travel history, so that proper infection control measures can be taken while they are being tested for MERS-CoV.
Temperature screening at the air checkpoints has been implemented to screen direct flights from the Middle East and South Korea. However, as MERS-CoV has an incubation period of up to 14 days, infected travellers may not have any fever when they pass through temperature screening and, therefore, they may not be picked up or detected at entry. Hence, our doctors and hospitals have been reminded to remain vigilant to the threat of MERS-CoV among travellers from the affected areas. Persons with symptoms of severe respiratory illness upon return from the Middle East or South Korea, and those with any respiratory symptoms and had visited a healthcare facility in South Korea or the Middle East, will be subjected to further investigations to rule out the possibility of MERS-CoV infection. They will be isolated until this investigation is completed. This year, up to 10 July 2015, a total of 62 such suspected cases have been investigated locally and all have tested negative for MERS-CoV.
However, it is a matter of time that the contagion will reach our shores. Therefore, beyond the preventive measures that I mentioned, Government agencies have contingency response plans in place should there be an imported case. Confirmed cases will be treated in isolation rooms and our healthcare workers taking care of them will wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and they have been trained to minimise the risk of contagion. In parallel, MOH will conduct contact tracing and quarantine all close contacts, to prevent further spread. We will update and exercise our response plans regularly. Recently, we conducted such an exercise at the Changi Airport and the simulated patient was conveyed in a portable medical isolation unit (PMIU) to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. We will continue to carry out similar exercises from time to time involving not only MOH but also other agencies as well.
The public too plays an important role in national preparedness by keeping up-to-date with the Government's advisories and exercising personal responsibility and good hygiene practices. The People's Association recently launched a nation-wide programme to train grassroots leaders on preventive measures to handle MERS-CoV so that they in turn can share the information and knowledge with residents at the constituency level.
The Ministry of Health and the Inter-Ministerial Committee will continue to monitor and assess the MERS-CoV situation. Our priority remains to prevent, detect, and contain any imported case into Singapore so that its impact on the community would be minimised.
: I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive response. What has happened to South Korea has been very difficult and very tragic. It is not possible to ignore the fact that South Korea, together with Singapore, is affected by SARS about a decade ago, so you cannot ignore the concerns. Just looking at South Korean experience, it appeared to have been too laggard in its response. There was some initial confusion. That is what appeared to have led to an explosion of cases, which has led to a significant number of fatalities. Subsequently, as we see now, it appears to have imposed quite good control over the situation, and the spread is now constrained.
The reason why I ask about an emergency preparedness exercise is because the danger is that, regardless of how many systems we have, the population may not recall how difficult it is, and how confusing it may be, when the initial signs first appear. So, I would like to press the Minister on this point whether it is necessary to have a wider preparedness exercise, maybe even involving the schools. Thank you.
: Thank you, Madam. Indeed, this is a very serious matter and MOH takes this very seriously. Therefore, we regularly remind members of the public and Singaporeans that MERS-CoV and Ebola, are real threats and we must take these threats seriously. We have also been sharing information as much as we possibly could with our Singaporeans as well as visitors who are coming to Singapore. That is why at the Airport, you would also see posters that are put up, for passengers who do not come from affected areas. We also want to remind them that should they have any difficulties, do consult our medical professionals. It is an area that we will continue to look at and we will consider various forms of exercises.
I think going beyond exercises, ID (Infectious Diseases) is something we will need to learn to live with. In the past, if you look back at maybe a decade or so ago, infectious diseases may not be so common. SARS was a major impact to Singaporeans. Before that, you may find that the threat of infectious diseases may come and go, and it happens from time to time. Going forward, I am afraid that it is going to be quite a constant feature because of the increased international connectivity. We are going to see that different forms of infectious diseases will threaten Singapore from time to time. An example is that MERS-CoV emerged in 2012. Before MERS was over, Ebola emerged. And now both Ebola and MERS are threats to Singapore. Bird flu, on the other hand, is also not totally eliminated either. So, I am afraid that going forward, we have to be vigilant constantly, so that we will be able to protect ourselves against the importation of these cases.
I take Prof Tan's point and we will look at how we can extend our public education, exercises and information, to as wide an audience as possible including school children. We have been working very closely with MOE. MOE is one of the members of the Inter-Ministerial Committee I mentioned earlier, so they are very closely-linked to what we are doing, and they themselves have also developed contingency plans and are carrying out education with their children.
: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Mdm Speaker, when SARS hit our shores quite a number of years ago, I was part of the constituency SARS Taskforce Committee. It was quite a difficult time to try to manage the situation.
Considering that there have been such a large number of deaths in South Korea, where the case started because of someone who was quite irresponsible, and considering that it has been spreading and there is a total of 36 people who have died in South Korea, would it not be better for MOH to be safe rather than sorry, and implement health screening at the Customs at the airport or Causeway? How much does it cost to implement such temperature health screening? So, two questions.
: I have just explained that we do have temperature screening for direct flights from Korea as well as from Middle East, the affected areas. But it is also important to point out, as I had mentioned in my reply, that there is an incubation period. During the incubation period, the passenger or the visitor may not display any symptoms, but he may already be carrying the virus, so symptoms will develop over the period of up to the next 14 days. Therefore, it is important for us, in addition to border monitoring and screening measures, that our healthcare institutions remain alert to this threat, so that they can identify passengers or patients who have travelled overseas. It is a matter of practice that all our doctors, when they see respiratory symptoms displayed among their patients, will ask about their travel history. It is something that we have always been reminding our doctors. We have also sent circulars to our doctors regularly to inform them of the latest development in the region as well as in the Middle East, so they are kept up-to-date of the development.
We do have border screening processes but it is not a 100% fool-proof system because of the incubation period. And some of them may have travelled through other countries as well, so they may not be directly travelling from the affected countries. They might have stayed a few days in other countries and, therefore while it is important to have border screening, it is not the only measure that we should rely on. What is more important is to ensure that our healthcare facilities are on high alert, they are vigilant, they are aware of this threat, and they are looking out for these symptoms and the travel history of their patients.

(for the Minister for National Development)
:
Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 11 to 14 together?
:
Yes, please.
: Madam, most of our new flats are sold under the Build-To-Order (BTO) programme where HDB directly influences design, construction and pricing. BTO flats are sold directly by HDB to flat buyers and HDB is fully responsible for the timely delivery and quality of the flats sold.
Despite a significant ramp up in our BTO programme over the last four years, the quality of BTO flats has not been compromised. On average, about a third of all new residents approach the Building Service Centre (BSC) for assistance after collecting their keys. Some of these requests for assistance, about a quarter of them, relate to issues such as low water pressure due to the implementation of water saving measures, as well as paint stains that need to be cleaned up in their units. Other requests, about 75%, relate to defects that residents come across. The vast majority of the reported defects are surface imperfections such as hairline cracks on walls, scratches on timber floor, or uneven tile joints. The number of defects reported has not changed significantly over the years. Such imperfections are mostly within acceptable industry norms and are also common in private developments. They can and should be rectified quickly by the contractors, and do not affect the structural integrity or safety of the building.
There is an objective industry standard to measure the quality of building projects. It is assessed independently by the Building & Construction Authority (BCA) and is known as Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) score. Over the years, the quality of BTO flats has improved from a score of 79 in 2003 to 89 in 2014. It continues to rise and is comparable to that in private developments.
HDB takes the quality of its homes seriously, not just because it is a major long-term investment of Singaporeans but, more importantly, because these are people's homes and, therefore, people's expectations are rising. HDB has a system of checks in place to ensure that its flats are free of major defects. However, due to the high dependency on workmanship of individual workers, we can expect that there will be some defects. Sometimes, this could be due to differences in the understanding of what constitutes a defect. For example, some owners have given feedback on colour inconsistencies for floor with timber finishes. As timber is a natural product, it is not possible to achieve a completely homogenous look.
There is a Defects Liability Period (DLP) to allow for any defects to be rectified. HDB also requires its contractors to deploy staff at the on-site Building Service Centre (BSC) to respond to residents' requests promptly and to rectify all defects within a stipulated time-frame.
But we do have zero tolerance for defects which may compromise structural or safety standards, or which deviate significantly from what has been promised to buyers.
Besides the BTO programme, there is the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) to give flat buyers more choice by allowing private developers to build and sell flats directly to the buyers. HDB sets the buyer's eligibility requirements and provides broad planning parameters such as the mix of flat types, flat sizes and the range of social and community facilities to be provided. Within this framework, the private developer of the DBSS project is responsible for the design, pricing and construction quality of the flat. Prospective buyers, in turn, decide if the price set by the developer is acceptable for the design and furnishings provided.
To protect homebuyers, the DBSS developer has to fully comply, like any other developer, with the requirements of the relevant authorities such as Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and BCA in the design and construction of the project, and the Controller of Housing in the marketing and sale of the units.
Furthermore, under the Sale and Purchase (S&P) Agreement between the DBSS developer and home buyers, the developer is contractually obliged to build the unit in a good and workman-like manner. The S&P also requires the developer to rectify any defects within the defects liability period.
DBSS projects are developed by different private developers, who may offer varying fixtures and finishes for their project. The feedback on the quality of finishes differs from project to project. Nonetheless, residents who face issues with the quality of the flats should report them to the Building Service Centre managed by the developer during the DLP. If the developer fails to address them, the buyers will have legal recourse against the developer as provided for under the S&P Agreement. Although HDB is not a party to this Agreement, HDB plays an active role in ensuring a fair and satisfactory outcome. When DBSS flat buyers raise concerns or feedback about DBSS units, HDB will approach and ask the developer to take the appropriate action under the circumstances.
: Madam, I would like to thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have three supplementary questions. With the sizeable complaints of recent DBSS projects arising from an apparent mismatch of expectations, poor workmanship and accountability, can I ask the Minister of State on the roles which should be played in overseeing the DBSS scheme from design and construction to handing over of keys? What more can be done to ensure greater accountability of developers?
With prices between private and HDB units, and the price gap between BTO and DBSS flats narrowing, what is the Ministry's direction on such premium HDB flats moving forward?
Finally, on the corridor width of 1.2 metres, will this width pose safety and rescue concerns, especially for those in wheelchairs or with mobility assisted devices?
: Madam, the Member asked three questions: first, on the role of HDB in DBSS. As I said earlier, HDB sets the broad parameters, such as eligibility, provides grants, decides on size and community services, and then with that, allows the private developer to build, finance, construct and sell. Nonetheless, as I said earlier, HDB will refer complaints to the developer and will work with the developer to ensure that residents' concerns are addressed. HDB upstream does actively engage DBSS developers by sharing HDB's experiences and lessons learned from previous DBSS projects and provides feedback in the areas of safety, security, durability and ease of maintenance. For example, during the early upstream stage in design, HDB will arrange for a meeting with the developer to share with them and their consultants HDB's experience on the above issues, like safety, durability, security and ease of maintenance and civil and structural design considerations, including lessons learned from DBSS' projects upstream and further measures.
As for DBSS as a scheme, MND has suspended DBSS scheme in 2011, as Members would know, and there is no plan to launch new DBSS projects in the immediate future. As the scheme is already suspended, we need not rush into deciding whether to abolish the scheme or not. We should take time to consider and review this as market conditions could be different and there may well be reasons to bring back the DBSS scheme in some form.
The Member also asked about the width of some corridors in recent DBSS projects that had been completed. That developer has chosen to restrict the width of the corridor to the safety limits as required by BCA and SCDF. Residents are concerned about this. It means that they may not be able to put anything outside the corridor. Everything has to be in the home or stored downstairs, for instance, bicycles. HDB is working with the advisers concerned and approaching the developer, along with the residents, to see how these concerns can be addressed.
: Mdm Speaker, I have four supplementary questions for the Minister of State. First, I am not sure if the Minister of State had answered my question about the rate of complaints on the DBSS scheme for the flats that were completed over the last two years. I want to know also whether the complaints have been rising and, given the wide public backlash over many of the DBSS flats that came up recently, would the Minister of State say how DBSS has fulfilled its intent. And, I quote, the intent is" to meet the housing aspirations of higher income flat buyers for better design and finishes". So, do all these complaints signify that the DBSS has actually failed in its intent?
Second, I want to know what is the comparison of the number of complaints for BTO versus DBSS flats, in terms of, say, per 100 or 1,000 flats that are completed.
Third supplementary question is this: the 2007 and 2013 BCA Accessibility Code has guidelines for doors, especially manoeuvring spaces at doors. For the term "doors", I am not sure if it also includes gates, because one of the complaints, for example, at Pasir Ris ONE is that the gates at the opposite ends can almost touch one another when they are all opened.
:
Mr Yee, can you please keep your supplementary question short?
:
So, can the Minister of State confirm whether the gates are considered as doors and whether they meet the BCA Code? Finally, the residents that I have communicated with in this DBSS, have complained that when they took up the design issues with the developers, they were told, and I quote, "Everything approved by HDB". I would like to understand what HDB does or does not approve. So, what are the areas that are approved by HDB?
: Madam, let me try to deal with the questions, in turn. As for the rate, the data that the Member has asked, I do not have these figures. In any event, when we talk about the rate of defect and DBSS units, first, as between DBSS projects, they differ significantly, because they are not standardised models. They differ in terms of their attributes; finish and the fittings that are available. So, that is not a meaningful comparison.
The second question - and this is more critical - is about whether, as the Member says, the scheme has failed in its intent. I am not quite sure what the Member means by "failed". Does it mean that it is not taken up by residents? Does it mean that all residents reject what they see after they moved into their units? It is important to also recognise in that respect that there have been 13 DBSS projects since 2005, and many, many residents have moved into these units and purchased them. They have seen it, they liked it, they moved in, and certainly like all developments, both HDB, BTO, private, as well as office and commercial, there will be defects, there will be concerns, and this is not to trivialise the defects and the concerns that first-time home buyers in particular feel when they see scratches or paint marks on their units, or more serious defects. But I think we should not, as Minister Lim talked about in the context of another Parliamentary Question (PQ) on MOM, use these current few points that have been in the public eye, to condemn the entire scheme as a failure. Many people have, indeed, lived and made homes with their families in these projects.
As for whether my view is that a gate is a door as specified under the 2007 and 2013 BCA accessibility guidelines, also a technicality of the nature of this query, please allow me to go back, perhaps the Member can communicate his concerns with me, and have a check. But if it is in relation to the Pasir Ris ONE project, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Member for Parliament of the constituency has visited the site. Residents have taken this issue up with him, the developer and HDB. Let us allow these negotiations to take place.
As for the claim that he heard that the DBSS developer had given approval for something or other, I think it is a bit too ambiguous as to what this is about. I think if there is some specificity about what he says has been approved by HDB, allow us to check with the background that he can provide us. As I said earlier, HDB provides a broad parameter on eligibility and so on, and within that, the private developer has a broad flexibility to design, build, finance and to sell.
: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for answering the parliamentary question that I submitted. I have one point to add on. While the number of defects may probably be the same as the Minister of State had highlighted earlier, in some countries, as my residents highlighted to me, they practised where the monies to be paid for to the developers or one main contractor are held back until all defects are cleared. At the same time, for the home owners, they also do joint inspections with the developer. So, in that sense, there is some incentive for the developer or the main contractor to close off the defects as soon as possible because what I notice affect two BTOs in my estate - one three years ago and one now. The number of defects, for your studies, is probably the same, but I think the reactions to the latest one are much more severe, largely because I think the developers tend to push back some of these defect complaints or they delay the repairs and so forth, and this frustrates many home owners.
The second question is when you have the cases where developers or contractors delay repairs or they are not able to do them on time, would HDB consider extending the DLP or postponing the start of the payment scheme for home owners? This means basically they start paying their mortgages later, and once it is completed, they move in. So, at some point, they see delays, they are frustrated, as it affects the time they get to move in, because these repairs are not done on time.
:
Perhaps, Mdm Speaker, may I just ask the Member to clarify. Is he asking in the context of BTO or DBSS?
:
Yes, BTO. Just for clarification, both estates I spoke of are BTOs.
:
Thank you. Madam, the Member has spoken about an idea that was provided to him by residents about some schemes overseas.
:
Yes, it is in Australia. When you take over a home, you do joint inspections and the money is held in escrow until the defects are all completed before the money is released to the developer or contractor.
:
In the context of delays and concerns that residents get affected when repairs and rectifications are delayed, under the Sales & Purchase Agreement for BTO, and I believe it is also in the case for DBSS, these have to be reported and resolved within the one -year defect liability period. But, specifically, I believe under the S&P Agreement, there is a requirement for the developer to address the issue and rectify within a month, and if he needs more time for whatever reason, like gathering of materials, doing more checks, then that needs to be agreed or informed to the buyer. If the developer or the contractor, in that case, does not resolve this within one month, then the buyer can give adequate notice to the contractor or developer to rectify, and then make a claim or reimbursement. So, in a way, we should not have delays in rectification. Sometimes, it is because the rectification is not up to the expectation of the resident, or there may be problems along the way that need to be resolved; there may be some time that is needed. But, by and large, our understanding is that most rectifications, particularly hairline cracks, stains, scratches, ought to be resolved and should be resolved by the contractors expeditiously, so as not to cause inconvenience to residents.
:
Mr Baey Yam Keng.
: Thank you, Madam. I would like to ask the Minister of State questions in three areas. First, he talked about the briefing sessions that HDB holds for DBSS developers about experience from past DBSS projects. May I ask, is there advisory given based on years of public housing experience that HDB has in terms of good design so that the DBSS developers can follow at the planning stage? Does HDB endorse, or is HDB even informed or briefed on the design before the project launch by the developer? So, this is question one.
The second question is about the statistics about the reported defects. The Minister of State has shared about BTO projects. Are there similar statistics about the defects received by the DBSS BSCs over these 13 projects? And is that a trend that reflects flat quality or is it just a matter of changing buyer expectations? Is there a CONQUAS score for DBSS projects as well, on top of what the Minister of State has shared for BTO projects?
My last question is about the role taken by HDB. If buyers have questions whether the DBSS developers have met the standards set by the various authorities, can HDB help to check and advise the buyers accordingly, or do we expect the buyers to pursue the matter at their own time, own effort and own cost?
: Madam, the first question, I think the answer should be yes as to whether or not HDB shares its experience, built on many years of public housing, to these DBSS developers. It will share its experience not in relation to past DBSS' projects, but also its experience on maintenance and the like.
The second one is on CONQUAS scores, whether that is also for DBSS, happily the answer is yes. I do not have the scores available. The third as to whether it is comparable, as I had said earlier, it is very difficult in the first place to compare one DBSS project from the other, because one project may have different configuration, different size. It may have different finishings, and certainly, different range, type and number of fittings. So, it will be very hard for there to be comparisons. And, more importantly, the comparison with BTO is hard to draw. As I had said earlier, for BTO projects, in the last four years, about a third of the new residents moving in have approached the Building Service Centres (BSCs) so we have the data for the average number of people approaching to raise concerns. And some of it, 25% relate to questions like there are stain marks, can you clear it up? Water pressure is low, why is it so? So, the answer will be, it is a water-saving measure that has to be implemented. Seventy-five percent relate to defects that are perceived by these residents, because they move in, and when they look and see these stretches or these paint marks that are on the wall, the surface imperfections, and they then raised it to the BSCs.
These kinds of surface imperfections and defects constitute the vast majority of the feedback given by the residents. And this can and should be resolved quickly by the contractors. I hope that addresses the questions raised.
:
I do agree with the Minister of State that we do have cases of surface imperfections. But increasingly, I am getting cases of real defects where we have wall cracks that comes with water seepages, doors unable to be closed properly or unable to fit nicely, or tiles which are easily stained but not easily be able to clean. So, these cause a lot frustration to residents and they have to take leave, and they have caused damages to the fixtures and so on. So, I would like to ask the Minister of State, why is it the case that there are so many of such defects: wall cracks, seepages and tiles staining? Is it an issue of supervision during construction or the sourcing of suppliers? And also, the Minister of State mentioned that about one-third, or 30% of the residents now to go BSCs but in some cases, in some of the blocks that I encountered, it is more than that. And whether the BSC has the resources to cope with those and to turn around fast enough, and whether HDB does come in to also push this along so that some of these can be rectified soonest?
:
In relation to the Member's first question, on his feedback that he has gotten in relation to some projects, was it a DBSS or BTO project?
:
BTO.
: If it is a BTO project, then HDB takes responsibility for the quality and of the construction. So, please, perhaps the Member can provide me the details as to which specific blocks or precincts, and then we can follow up. As to what is the issue with the development, whether it is tiles, whether it is doors, or whether it is the tap, toilet or whatever, and we will then follow up on that concern.
As to whether the BSCs have the capacity to deal with these concerns, HDB requires sufficient staff to man the BSC. If a BSC is found to be inadequate in terms of staffing, then it is something that the Branch Office has to feedback and then we will then make sure that the staffing is adequate.
We want to make sure that the teething concerns of residents as they move in to their new homes, particularly first-time home buyers, are addressed and addressed suitably. There may be some frustration as to why when things take a little longer, but it is a matter of resourcing. We will fix this.
: Madam, in response to Member Liang Eng Hwa's question, the Minister of State said that in the case of BTO, HDB takes responsibility in terms of complaints of defects. I am asking in terms of DBSS. In the case of DBSS, does the HDB take the same responsibility like BTO projects to make sure that the defects are rectified? In his response to Mr Yee Jenn Jong's question, he said that let us do not trivialise the defects and complaints. Is he saying that the complaints by residents on the defects are trivial and not important? He also spoke about imperfection of works and the defects. Can he clarify what is imperfection and what is considered a defect? Hairline crack
vis-Ã-vis
a hole somewhere, I think that will make clear so that residents can understand what is imperfection and what is a real defect.
Madam, I understand that there is a CONQUAS score for DBSS flats. Would the Minister of State make public the CONQUAS score for DBSS flats and also for the cluster or development so that residents would know what is the CONQUAS score for DBSS and for the specific DBSS developments.
It seems that the HDB takes the approach that for DBSS flats, it is between the resident and the developer. And thereby, the resident deals with developer, whether to take legal recourse. If the developer fails to follow up with the defect complaint or take certain action to rectify it, then, claim against the developer. But, Madam, it is not that simple. It all concerns legal matter. It all concerns legal cost. We would like to know specifically what role is HDB playing in terms of residents' complaints of defects.
And, lastly, I understand that within this defect liability period, residents can make claims. But in actual fact, there are problems that residents cannot solve themselves. So, could HDB consider asking the developer of DBSS projects to extend the liability period for another year so that residents can be have more time to get the developer to rectify the problems? And also, there are certain problems. I mean, some residents claim that because ---
:
Mr Low, please keep your supplementary questions short.
:
Yes. Because of the use of the materials, the defect may not surface within a year. Thank you.
: I think Mr Low have five or six questions. First, I will deal with question two, as to whether I said I trivialised residents' concerns. I think the Member might want to review the transcript. I made it very clear that we should not trivialise resident's concerns, far from trivialising their concerns. Perhaps, there is a misunderstanding there. I hope to make it very clear that it is indeed not the case.
As to what the responsibility of the HDB is in respect of DBSS
vis-Ã-vis
BTO, I have said it in my first reply and subsequent responses to various Members. For BTO projects, HDB is the developer. In the DBSS, the developer is a private developer. HDB sets the broad parameters within which the private developer is given the flexibility and because of that, it takes responsibility for its private development works as a DBSS project. The Sale and Purchase Agreement is black and white. It is with the resident and the developer. But having said that, that is not to say that HDB entirely takes no responsibility whatsoever, does not do anything at all. That is clearly not the experience.
For example, when Minister of State Sim Ann had some issues with the Trivelis – and certainly, I am sure Mr Low had followed that with keen interest – HDB, although it is not party to the agreement, followed up the developer, approached it, worked behind the scenes, worked closely with the advisor to make sure that as between the developer running the DBSS project and the residents, there is some resolution in sight. For example, in Trivelis, it is public knowledge that the developer has made an offer to residents. This is a matter of negotiation that is on-going.
As to whether the CONQUAS scores for all the DBSS projects can be disclosed, I have to check; I think they may be already public for each of the 13 DBSS projects. Let me check and follow up with the hon Member.
As to whether the DLP needs to be extended, I think we do not talk about it in a vacuum or about general concerns about whether residents are able to resolve the issues expeditiously. As I said earlier to this House, the issues need to be surfaced within the one year DLP and resolved. The developer has certain timelines that it must meet or the contractors have certain timelines that they must meet. If for some reason, any particular development is of particular concern, a particular reason for delay and if there is any basis at all for asking for the DLP to be extended, then let us look it specifically and not in abstract.
asked
the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs with regard to the incident along Orange Grove Road on 31 May 2015 (a) what were the security measures in place to protect the Shangri-La Dialogue from the risks of terrorist attacks; (b) what are SPF's rules of engagement to deal with vehicles that breach the security checkpoints; and (c) what steps will be taken to establish the circumstances that led to the death of the driver.
: Mdm Speaker, the annual Shangri-La Dialogue is attended by Defence Ministers, Defence Officials and Military Chiefs from around the world. In the current security climate, such a major international security event is a prime target for terrorists. A high security protection level was therefore adopted for this event.
As part of the security measures to secure the event and to protect delegates and others involved in the event, Police conducted a series of road blocks and security checks on persons and vehicles at and around Shangri-La Hotel from 28 May to 31 May 2015. Six check stations for persons and five check stations for vehicles were set up.
At the Vehicle Check Stations, vehicles entering or approaching the hotel were checked to make sure that they were not carrying dangerous weapons or explosives, such as Vehicle-borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs), which could be used to harm persons at the hotel or in its vicinity.
Mdm Speaker, according to the Global Terrorism Index Report 2014, explosives have consistently been the most prevalent type of weapon used in attacks, accounting for over 60% of all incidents globally. Past incidents in the Middle East involving the use of car bombs have resulted in heavy death tolls. In 2001, the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network had planned to use truck bombs against embassies, MRT stations and military installations in Singapore. The Bali bombings in 2002 and the Marriot Hotel attack in Jakarta in 2003 also involved the use of vehicle bombs. These are all sober reminders that Singapore is not immune to this threat.
Police adopt a multi-stage approach to deter, detect and deal with the threat of vehicle bombs when they assess that such protection levels are warranted. The Shangri-La Dialogue, for the reasons I explained earlier, was one such occasion.
First, Police deploy traffic signs in the vicinity of the affected roads, and ahead of the brightly-lit Vehicle Check Stations, to alert motorists to the road closures and the checks that are being conducted in conjunction with the event.
Second, vehicles approaching the Vehicle Check Station are stopped by Police officers for initial verification checks, before being directed to undergo a detailed inspection within the Vehicle Check Station. Measures are also put in place, according to what the terrain permits, to cause vehicles to slow down before approaching the Vehicle Check Station. For the Shangri-La Dialogue, the Vehicle Check Station was designed in a manner that required the driver to manoeuvre around concrete blocks to reach the vehicle inspection bays within the Vehicle Check Station.
Third, beyond the detailed inspection point, a line of concrete barriers weighing about two tons each, Police land rovers or mobile crash barriers are deployed to deter, slow down and impede drivers who may attempt to evade checks at the Vehicle Check Station and drive vehicle bombs into an event area.
Beyond this line of barriers, armed Police officers are deployed to deal with vehicles evading the Vehicle Check Station checks.
Based on Police's procedures, drivers will be allowed to proceed to the venue only after being cleared by checks.
However, if there are drivers who try to evade security checks, Police officers will respond swiftly and decisively to stop the vehicle threat. In a situation where a driver ignores Police's repeated orders to stop, and crashes his vehicle through the concrete barriers, causing an imminent threat to lives, Police's procedure, as a last resort, is to open fire at the driver of the vehicle to neutralise the threat immediately to prevent it from causing danger to the event and the delegates and others involved in the event.
The use of lethal force is provided for under section 63 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which states: "Any Police officer, who has reasonable grounds to suspect that any offence may be committed, may intervene for the purpose of preventing, and must, to the best of his ability, use all lawful means to prevent the commission of the offence". The level of force used should be proportionate to the threat faced.
Mdm Speaker, the vehicle and the persons in it were acting in a non-compliant, aggressive and threatening manner. The measures taken by Police were precise and their effect limited to the vehicle and persons in it. They were stopped from penetrating into and posing a danger to an event which was assessed to be subject to a high level of threat. The vigilance, alertness, and composure of our Police officers in this incident reflect the high level of professionalism and skill which comes from realistic training and regular exercises to enhance their readiness and validate contingency plans.
Mdm Speaker, a Coroner's Inquiry will be conducted, as required by law, in the coming months to establish the detailed cause of and circumstances leading to the shooting and death of the driver. At the conclusion of the Inquiry, the Coroner will record his findings as to how the deceased came by his death.
The Ministry of Home Affairs is also reviewing the incident thoroughly, and will incorporate any relevant findings from the Coroner's Inquiry to ensure that Police's measures continue to be effective in deterring, preventing, and dealing with potential security threats.
Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, the threat of terrorism is real and present. The Police will continue to do their utmost to counter security threats to Singapore and protect Singaporeans from those who wish to carry out acts of violence and destruction. We call on all Singaporeans to maintain a high level of vigilance against possible security threats, and support the Home Team in our efforts to keep all of us safe.

: Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Lee Biow Chuan, Ms Irene Ng and Dr Lim Wee Kiak for their concern and their questions. On 5 June, an earthquake struck suddenly at Mount Kinabalu. Seven students and two teachers from Tanjong Katong Primary School (TKPS), plus one Singaporean instructor, who were on the mountain, lost their lives. We are all deeply saddened by this tragedy. Once again, I want to express my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who were lost. Besides our 10 Singaporeans, six Malaysians, including two Mountain Torq trainers who were with the students and staff of TKPS, also lost their lives. We extend our condolences to their families and friends too.
At the same time, we are glad that we were able to bring back 22 students and six teachers safely. We are grateful to the Sabah guides and Mountain Torq trainers who helped our teachers to evacuate our students from the mountain. We would also like to thank the Royal Malaysia Police, Malaysian Armed Forces, and all the other Malaysian agencies, including the Sabah state authorities, for their support and assistance in the search, rescue and recovery efforts. Many agencies in Singapore worked with MOE to assist and support the affected students, families, teachers and staff of the school. The community, including our SEA Games athletes, rallied to offer their sympathy and support, and thousands visited TKPS to pay tribute to those who passed away. In an expression of our sympathies and condolences for the families who lost their loved ones, the Prime Minister declared 8 June a Day of National Remembrance, with State flags flown at half-mast, and the observation of a minute of silence at all SEA Games venues. The outpouring of support from the whole nation brought much comfort to the families, students and teachers. I know that they, as well as my Ministry and I, deeply appreciate this support and sense of togetherness.
Before I outline what happened, let me first explain the context of outdoor adventure learning. MOE and schools conduct a variety of outdoor adventure learning programmes. This mode of learning is a proven and effective way to develop social and leadership skills in students. Students learn to lead, make decisions, and work together to tackle challenging tasks in an outdoor environment. In the process, they grow in confidence and resilience.
A large proportion of outdoor adventure learning takes place in Singapore at adventure facilities run by MOE and Outward Bound Singapore. These purpose-designed facilities and programmes provide valuable learning opportunities and will continue to enhance them.
Our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning also organise overseas learning journeys to bring students overseas for academic, cultural and adventure learning. These overseas experiences provide learning platforms that cannot be easily replicated in classrooms, or anywhere else in Singapore. For example, overseas adventure learning programmes, including mountain trekking, challenge students to adapt to new and unfamiliar environments, away from home comforts.
As these overseas adventure learning programmes have a high educational value, some schools use them to develop leadership qualities for selected groups of students, such as student leaders as well as those in uniformed groups and outdoor activity clubs.
TKPS places a strong emphasis on developing students' leadership skills. It has designed an apex leadership programme called the "Omega Challenge" which comprises a three-day climb to the summit of Mount Kinabalu. The Omega Challenge started in 2009 and this year marks the seventh run of the programme. Two hundred and fifteen TKPS students have undergone this programme. In fact, I have met some of these students myself. Past students and their parents have told the school how this programme has helped the students to grow in confidence and maturity in ways that exceeded their expectations. For many of the students, the experience of having to overcome the physical and mental challenges to conquer Mount Kinabalu was a metaphor for learning to conquer themselves and future challenges in life. With its high educational value, the programme is very much sought after. Students vie for a place in the Omega Challenge and take pride in being selected. They are chosen based on qualities such as their emotional maturity, leadership skills and physical abilities.
Schools that organise overseas trips and outdoor adventure learning have to ensure that these activities are suitable for participating students. They have to adhere to the following principles set out by MOE.
First, the activities have clear educational goals. Second, the activities are age-appropriate. Third, the safety and well-being of students and staff are accorded top priority in the planning and execution of the activities. Fourth, more physically challenging programmes are optional and are open only to students who meet certain requirements. Fifth, there are adequate preparations, including risk assessments and management.
Ahead of this year's trip to Mount Kinabalu, TKPS undertook the following preparations. First, the school confirmed that the activities were age-appropriate. On the official Mount Kinabalu website, it is recommended that children who attempt the climb be at least 10 years old. The "Via Ferrata" activities that the students were going to carry out along the slopes of Mount Kinabalu, under the guidance of professional trainers, is also graded as suitable for children aged 10 and above. All the participating students from the school were aged 11 to 13.
Second, the school recognised that this programme may not be suitable for all students, and that parents' comfort levels also differ. Hence, the school ensured that consent was granted by the students' parents and also briefed them on what the overseas portion of the programme would entail.
Third, the school conducted screening processes to select a small group of 29 student leaders who were assessed to be physically fit, as well as emotionally and mentally ready.
Fourth, the school conducted three months of rigorous physical training, like endurance runs and stair-climbing to prepare them.
Fifth, the school went through a detailed risk assessment before embarking on the trip.
I will now briefly touch on what happened on the morning of 5 June 2015. The earthquake that struck Mount Kinabalu that fateful morning was sudden and unexpected. It dislodged boulders and rocks near the top of the mountain and these came crashing down the mountain slope. This happened when the students and the adults who were accompanying them had just started on an activity along the "Via Ferrata".
With your permission, Mdm Speaker, may I display some slides on the LED screens?
:
Yes, please [
A slide was shown to hon Members
].
: To understand what happened, let me explain how the "Via Ferrata" activity was organised. The "Via Ferrata" activity required the participants to walk or climb a route that ran along the slope of the mountain, using a system of harnesses connected to a metal cable to secure them and prevent any risk of a fall. There are three "Via Ferrata" routes and TKPS chose the simplest and shortest route; which spanned 280 metres, was suitable for 10-year-olds and required about an hour or slightly more to complete.
So, if you look at this slide, the one in which the TKPS students attempted is the one in red; it is the shortest and simplest. You might have seen also pictures of this "Via Ferrata" which were on the other parts of the circuit, and these were not what the students attempted. Thirty-one TKPS participants, comprising 23 students and eight school staff, attempted the "Via Ferrata" activity. Six students did not take part in this activity and were resting at a nearby hut. Those who participated were organised into five groups; each led by a trainer provided by the operator of the "Via Ferrata", Mountain Torq. To ensure proper supervision and control, each group was sent out a few minutes apart to avoid bunching up. Each group had up to five students and three adults, making the adult-to-student ratio approximately 1:2.
At 7.15am when the earthquake struck, the first three groups had already started out on the "Via Ferrata", while the last two groups were still at the start line waiting for their turn. From the accounts we had gathered, the first three groups that were on the mountain slope, were in the path of a very heavy rockfall. The last two groups that were at the starting point were less badly hit by the falling rocks and stones, perhaps the rockfall there was less heavy or because there were some trees in the vicinity that offered some protection.
Some of the boulders dislodged by the earthquake were as large as a house or a car, as Members can see from this slide [
A slide was shown to hon Members
]. This was one of the pieces that were dislodged.
The casualties amongst the first three groups included both children and adults. Seven students and five adults, including two Mountain Torq trainers who were experienced and familiar with the terrain and safety procedures lost their lives. For the other two groups that were waiting at the start point, they all survived, with the majority of them unhurt. Whether a participant perished or survived depended on where he or she happened to be at that time. It made no difference whether the participant was a child or adult, novice or experienced climber.
When the earthquake struck, many of the TKPS students recounted that the teachers near them used their bodies to protect and shield them from harm. Once the initial tremors subsided, the adults accompanying the students were able to quickly work together to give instructions for the students to evacuate. As far as possible, the students who were unhurt or only slightly injured were organised into groups to be led down the mountain. The evacuation was made more difficult because the paths had been damaged by the quake, and there were many aftershocks that morning. Some of the adults, including those who were themselves injured, stayed on to help the students who were more seriously injured or required greater assistance.
On the same day, the Singapore Government Crisis Team responded, first with an immediate Crisis Response Team from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) that reached Kota Kinabalu by 8.00 pm, to help coordinate the needs of the Singaporeans in Kota Kinabalu affected by the earthquake.
By the end of the first day, my Ministry had already made plans for those family members who wanted to be in Kota Kinabalu to be flown up early the next morning. I conveyed this to the parents who were waiting at the school. We sent a multi-agency delegation, together with several counsellors and TKPS teachers, who flew together in a SAF C130 aircraft to directly support the family members. Concurrently, plans were put in place to fly home the students who were physically able to do so. By the next day after the quake, on 6 June afternoon, 19 TKPS students had returned to Singapore. Three students with more serious injuries remained in Kota Kinabalu to receive treatment. Two were evacuated back the next day and the third by 8 June.
Over in Kota Kinabalu, the MOE-led delegation supported the family members through this difficult period and worked to ensure that all the bodies that were recovered were flown back at the earliest possible moment so that last rites could be performed and the deceased laid to rest. A tribute site was set up at TKPS for the public to pay their tribute. In the days that followed, TKPS teachers and over 100 counsellors and psychologists rallied to support the participants and their family members. We witnessed the courage and resilience of the affected students, teachers and their family members as they did their best to come to terms with what had happened.
In our review of this incident, it is clear that in the planning and execution of any overseas learning journey, our schools must continue to conduct risk assessments and take all the necessary safety measures and precautions. Nevertheless, natural disasters are impossible to predict or exclude entirely. Indeed, seismologists considered the probability of such a destructive earthquake happening in the area around Mount Kinabalu to be unknown. There was no prior warning. No matter how careful our schools may be in planning their overseas trips, events that are beyond our control and prediction may still occur, whether natural disasters or otherwise.
We are all deeply saddened by the sudden and unexpected earthquake that claimed the lives of our students and some of the adults who were accompanying them. Their families, as well as their friends and colleagues, will need time to recover from this. We will therefore continue to give our utmost support to them, through counselling and other appropriate support measures.
At the same time, let us honour the spirit which our students and teachers have shown in undertaking this trip, to stretch and challenge themselves to achieve their personal best. Several parents who lost children told me, we must continue to provide high quality learning programmes for our students, including such overseas adventure learning. I am deeply moved and inspired by their conviction and encouragement.
Like many parents, MOE is convinced of the value of outdoor adventure learning, whether conducted in Singapore or overseas. We will continue to enhance the quality of such learning opportunities, while ensuring that schools continue to emphasise safety when planning these trips and programmes. It is important that we provide effective learning platforms for our students to build their confidence, adaptability and resilience, qualities that will stand them in good stead in life.
MOE regularly looks for ways to enhance the quality of all our learning programmes, including outdoor adventure learning programmes. As part of this effort, my Ministry will form an Advisory Panel comprising local and international experts. This panel will provide MOE with additional inputs on enhancing the quality and safety of outdoor adventure learning programmes that are conducted locally and overseas.
MOE conducts annual audits of schools' overseas learning journeys. In conducting these annual audits, we look for good practices that can be shared, and provide support and guidance in areas identified for improvement. In this year's audit, MOE will look at how to improve contingency plans for events, such as natural disasters. We also note that the Malaysian government has indicated that in view of the recent unexpected earthquake, it will assess and monitor seismic movements in Sabah and review safety measures for all climbers. Until the safety of Mount Kinabalu is ascertained by the Malaysian authorities, no schools will be allowed to take students there.
The incident on the slopes of Mount Kinabalu has also highlighted the courage and devotion of the school staff and instructors who accompanied the students, as well as the efforts by the Mountain Torq trainers and Sabah mountain guides who helped evacuate our students to safety. As I mentioned earlier, we have heard accounts of selfless acts of adults who accompanied the students to Mount Kinabalu. We also know that all the teachers who accompanied the students had trained with the students for many months, and devoted much of their time and energy to carefully plan for this trip. What they did at Mount Kinabalu was a continuation of their care and devotion to our students. Their selfless acts and devotion to duty have drawn tributes from many Singaporeans, and have given rise to calls for formal recognition, including calls from Members of this House.
We will honour the staff and instructors who accompanied our students to Mount Kinabalu in a manner that is befitting of their courage and sacrifice. The Government will announce further details at the appropriate time.
In addition, MOE has also launched the Sabah Earthquake Fund to help rebuild the lives that were affected by this earthquake. The donations will be a tangible way to provide financial assistance to the dependants of the two Singaporean teachers and one instructor who had lost their lives. Part of the Fund will also be passed to the Mountain Torq trainers and Sabah guides, as some had lost their lives, and the rest have to worry about their livelihood in the aftermath of the damage caused by the earthquake. This is a meaningful way for us to show our care for those affected by the Sabah earthquake, to whom we are indebted.
In conclusion, once again, I want to thank the Malaysian authorities and the people of Sabah for their valuable assistance and friendship.
I thank the many agencies and people in Singapore who spontaneously came forward to assist and support the affected students and families, as well as the teachers and staff of TKPS. As the bereaved mourned the loss of their loved ones, our nation mourned with them. The staff of my Ministry and I, myself, have been very moved to see Singaporeans' solidarity and generosity of support during this difficult time.
Let us take this time to remember the grace and thoughtfulness of the parents and families of those who left us. Let us cherish and honour the spirit of our students, teachers and instructors. Let us be inspired by their courage, tenacity and determination to challenge themselves, brave adversity, and achieve their best.
:
Members may seek clarifications on the Ministerial Statement. Are there any Members wishing to do so? Ms Irene Ng.
:
Madam, my condolences again to the families and friends of those who lost their lives at the Sabah Earthquake. I thank the Minister for his reply and we support the Ministry's approach to outdoor adventure learning and its continuance. The Minister mentioned that he will announce at an appropriate time the details on how to honour those who had sacrificed and showed courage during the incident. It has been more than a month since the Sabah quake disaster. Can I ask the Minister when will be the appropriate time and why is not this Parliament sitting a good time for this news to be announced?
: Mdm Speaker, I thank Ms Irene Ng for her question. In fact, ever since the quake occurred, my Ministry's priority has been to provide as much comfort as possible to the families of those who lost their loved ones, as well as to focus on helping the students and teachers of the school who are affected by this incident to recover and to recover as quickly as possible. There are many pieces of work that we were embarking on and it also took us some time to ascertain the facts of the case. As you would imagine, an incident like this was chaotic, it was completely unexpected and, therefore, we were very careful in going through the details of what had happened, so that we could have a full picture of the sequence of activities and the role played by the different people who were involved.
We will certainly announce this at the appropriate time when we have decided on it. But we will certainly, as I announced earlier on, do something that reflects the courage and the selfless devotion of the teachers and adults who accompanied the students.
: Mdm Speaker, I join the Minister to express my deepest condolences to those who have lost their lives in this unfortunate tragedy. I want to thank the Minister for clarifying the safety considerations taken by the school as well as the MOE to ensure that every student's welfare, every student's safety is paramount regardless of the kind of learning journey or programme undertaken by the students. So, I thank the Minister as well as MOE for that assurance.
Tanjong Katong Primary School is located within Mountbatten. I visited the school, I attended the wakes of some of the children, as well as the teacher who passed away in this misfortune. From the conversations with several of the students, what came out were some stories about the heroic behaviour of some of the teachers who went up and down the mountain to help the students and some who shielded the students from the falling rocks.
Whilst I appreciate what the Minister had said about the recognition, I hope that the recognition would not just be in the form of monetary. I think we must go beyond monetary compensation to recognise the heroic behaviour of the teachers. And some of these teachers are survivors as well.
So, may I ask the Minister to clarify that the awards that we are planning would not just be purely monetary but also a kind of award to recognise that effort? The other thing that I would like to ask the Minister to clarify is for the students and teachers who survived the tragedy, what kind of counselling would they be given because what came out in the newspapers was that some of the children had witnessed scenes which they should not have seen as young children. For some of the survivors, they may have a period where they will undergo this guilt trip that they survived the accident. I hope the Minister can clarify what kind of counselling would they be given and for what kind of period because some of these may have long-lasting impact.
: Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Lim Biow Chuan for his questions. First, I would also like to thank Mr Lim for his support to the families of those who had lost their family members. Mr Lim himself attended some of the wakes with me and provided very good support to the school. I thank Mr Lim for that.
On his first question on the form of recognition, I would like to assure Mr Lim that no, it would not be monetary award. We have kept it separate. We started the Sabah Earthquake Fund because there were many members of the public who wanted to show their support and solidarity. We will announce details of the Sabah Earthquake Fund later; that is a separate matter.
As to the second question about the needs of the students, from the moment the quake occurred, MOE activated a very large team of counsellors from all parts of Government, not only from the Ministry of Education, but also from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social and Family Development, and our hospitals and KKH. There is a very large team of psychologists and counsellors who responded immediately. Many of them volunteered. I am very touched by the spirit of our people in that everybody came forward to provide support and volunteered. On the day itself, we already had many counsellors who had been counselling the students, the teachers as well as family members. As for the students and teachers, we will continue to provide the counselling. We have deployed an additional counsellor and an additional Vice Principal to TKPS so that we can look after the students and teachers well.
I am glad to say that the students are responding well. Most of them are doing fine; they are carrying on with the normal routine in school. For those who need additional help, we will continue for as long as they need this, and our counsellors have been working together with them. I would like to assure Mr Lim that most of the students are responding very well.

: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
The Constitution (Amendment) Bill before the House seeks to include Temasek Holdings in the Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework from Fiscal Year 2016.
The current framework that governs Government spending of investment returns from Temasek is based on the actual dividends received from Temasek. The amendment to the Constitution would shift the Government's spending to one based on the expected long-term real rate of return on Temasek's net assets, including both realised and unrealised capital gains.
I had announced the Government's intention to make this change, and why we are doing so now, when I addressed the House earlier this year in Budget 2015. We debated the proposed change. Several Members spoke on the proposal, and were in support of it. We are now proceeding with the formal amendments to the Constitution to implement the change.
The NIR framework was introduced in the amendments to the Constitution that Parliament passed in 2008. It has three main features:
(a) First, the NIR framework caps Government spending at 50% of investment returns. This 50% cap had in fact been introduced when the Constitution was amended in 2001, and was retained in 2008.
(b) Second, Government spending under the NIR framework is based on real returns instead of nominal returns. This ensures that the value of our reserves is not eroded over time because of global inflation. It preserves the international purchasing power of our reserves.
(c) Thirdly, the NIR framework is based on expected long-term returns. The expected returns include both realised and unrealised capital gains. They hence do not depend on whether investments are divested, and capital gains realised.
This is an important feature. It reduces the volatility of Government spending based on investment income, as the expected long-term returns do not hinge on the state of the markets from one year to the next. It hence enables better fiscal planning.
These are the three technical features in how the NIR framework enables and caps Government spending. But they reflect the more fundamental commitments that we have made through the framework.
We are committing ourselves to sustaining the value of the nation's reserves over the long term, so that the reserves provide a defence against crises encountered by our children or any future generation of Singaporeans.
We are also committing to a fair balance between the interests of today and tomorrow – between meeting immediate needs, the future needs of the current generation of Singaporeans – and importantly, the interests of our future generations.
The NIR framework provides a significant stream of income for today's spending – already about 2% of GDP, in fact it is slightly more than 2% today, on the Government budget – but also seeks to ensure a broadly similar stream for decades into the future.
When the NIR framework was introduced in 2008, it was intended to be applied eventually, to the expected returns of all three of our investment entities – GIC, MAS and Temasek. We proceeded with GIC and MAS first.
We had deferred Temasek's inclusion when the NIR framework was first introduced, and indicated that we would review this after some years of implementation. Temasek's investment strategy was still evolving then, having only begun to invest in more geographies and sectors in 2002. There were also no established methodologies for projecting expected returns for a portfolio like Temasek's, given its investment approach of taking concentrated stakes and making direct investments.
The Government is now ready to apply the NIR framework to all three investment entities. We have worked with Temasek to develop a methodology for projecting its expected returns. We have also had the benefit of the experience gained from implementing the NIR framework with the GIC and MAS. Having gone through the global financial crisis, which dramatically shifted the global outlook and both consensus and expert views of future returns, we are assured that the NIR framework and the processes we have in place are sufficiently robust.
Including the Temasek in the NIR Framework will provide the Government with additional fiscal resources in the years to come. We estimate that it will increase the total NIR contribution to the Budget from about 2% of GDP on today's framework to about 3% on average over the next five years under the enhanced framework.
The enhancement to the NIR framework is not the only change in our revenues. We have also made, as Members know, changes to our domestic taxes. Our first move was to make our property tax regime more progressive and to increase property tax rates at the higher end. We also increased personal income taxes for those in the top income brackets in this year's Budget.
Together these enhancements to our revenues come as we embark on the next phase of our nation's development. We are making critical investments in the coming years in three key areas:
(a) In healthcare, where we have strengthened support for both lower- and middle-income Singaporeans and are expanding the capacity of our healthcare system to cater to a progressively older population.
(b) In human capabilities, where we are making a major investment in our people through SkillsFuture, while spending more to strengthen education from the pre-school to the tertiary levels. We are also investing in R&D and innovation as the basis for future growth of our enterprises.
(c) And thirdly, in our transport infrastructure, where we are already investing in a much larger and better public transport system. We will also be developing Changi Airport T5 and Tuas sea port for the long term.
Each of these major investments will benefit all Singaporeans, not just a particular group. It will also bring benefits for our economy and our society for many years to come. The enhancement to our revenues through the inclusion of Temasek in the NIR framework and our other revenue measures will benefit Singaporeans today and tomorrow.
I will now describe the relevant amendments to the Constitution. I can be brief, because the main change is simple. The Bill seeks to amend article 142(4) of the Constitution to include Temasek's net assets in the definition of the "relevant assets" from 1 April 2016. Currently, the relevant assets are defined only for GIC and MAS.
The term "relevant assets" is the asset base upon which the relevant entities' expected long-term real rates of return are applied, in order to derive the amount of NIR contribution that can be taken into the budget.
"Relevant assets" refers to the net assets managed or owned by the respective investment entities, less the liabilities of the Government, which includes borrowings such as SGS and SSGS.
The other amendments in the Bill relate to technical changes to the names of Government companies currently listed at Part II of the Fifth Schedule as well as the removal of obsolete references to Fiscal Year 2000 in Article 142. These technical changes are not material.
Mdm Speaker, we are not alone in our approach of writing rules into the Constitution to bind current and future Governments to the practice of fiscal sustainability. We were an early adopter with the Constitution being first amended in 1991 to protect the reserves through the institution of the Elected Presidency. This was followed by two rounds of amendments in 2001 and 2008 to set out clear rules limiting Government spending of the investment income from our reserves.
Since then, several other countries have introduced similar measures to institutionalise fiscal prudence. It has caught on since the global financial crisis especially. To give some examples, Germany made a constitutional amendment in 2009 requiring government to run budgets at, or close to, structural balance every year. To stick to this fiscal rule, the Germans are having to cut back on spending and have introduced new taxes. As a result, Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen by more than 6 percentage-points since its 2010 peak to reach 75% at the end of 2014.
Spain, which has much higher debts at about 100% of GDP, introduced a balanced budget constitutional amendment in 2011. It will be binding from 2020 onwards. But Spain has already begun painful adjustments.
The UK is another example. Its government debt is still above 80% of GDP despite the sharp reductions in public spending in recent years. The government has now proposed a "Charter for Budget Responsibility". It would require the government to aim for budget surpluses in normal times so as to reduce its debts over time.
The Swiss moved earlier with a similar constitutional amendment that requires the government to plan for structurally balanced budgets. Switzerland's debts are much lower than most other European countries but they want to avoid rising debts.
In all these cases, governments are trying reduce the future burden of debts on their government budgets. They want to avoid rising debt servicing costs, which squeeze out other spending, including essential spending.
Our starting point is very different. The Singapore Government's balance sheet is in a net asset position, not a net debt position. Far from having to raise taxes or cut spending to pay for debts, our NIR framework provides us with a stable stream of revenue for the Budget each year well into the future.
That is the privilege we have, because of the prudent fiscal policies the Government adopted when we were a young nation, when our population too was young and the economy was growing quickly. We ran budget surpluses in good times, and did not seek to spend surpluses just because the money was there. We invested the reserves prudently, and built up professional capabilities in global investing. The approach that we have taken in the past has put us in a position of strength now, as our population gets older and as growth slows.
A transition of Temasek to the NIR framework will provide the Government with added fiscal resources to make the critical investments in capabilities and infrastructure that we need for the future. But the amendments introduced today do not alter the commitments we made when we introduced the NIR framework in the Constitution in 2008. The framework commits us to sustaining the value of our reserves and to achieving a fair and judicious balance between the interests of today and tomorrow: a balance between standing for today's needs and saving for the future needs of today's generation, and generations to come. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.
Question proposed.
: Mdm Speaker, I wish to declare that I do work in a company where Temasek owns a substantial stake. When the Finance Minister announced at this year Budget speech that Temasek will be included in the NIR Framework, similar to the other two investment entities GIC and MAS, my immediate reaction then was that are we again looking to the kitty under the bed to fund our ever-growing spending needs?
As I went back to read the Second Reading speech for the Constitution Amendment way back in 2008, the Finance Minister did mention then that it would be prudent to leave Temasek out of the new framework for the time being and to review again after some years. So, this is indeed the unfinished part or the final instalment of the constitutional changes to our returns' spending framework.
The question is what has changed in the last seven years to now justify the inclusion of Temasek into the NIR framework?
Temasek's investment mandate has largely been unchanged; which is to invest in both public and private equity including taking concentrated stakes in a number of companies. Compared to GIC and MAS, Temasek manages a more risky portfolio and its returns are a lot more volatile.
Take for example the recent volatility in the Chinese and Hong Kong equity markets that we saw in the last few weeks. Obviously, the impact will be more on Temasek than on GIC and MAS.
Given the difficulties in projecting a long-term expected real return for an all-equity portfolio, it was the right decision then to defer the inclusion of Temasek into the new NIR framework.
Deputy Prime Minister Tharman mentioned in the Budget Statement speech that Ministry of Finance have since worked with Temasek to develop an approach to project its expected long-term returns, taking into account the nature of its investment portfolio.
Can the Minister share more details on the approach and how would the computing of the expected long-term real return for Temasek be different from that for GIC and MAS? Are there different risk-weightings applied and what are those?
Under the current framework for Temasek, the contributions are from dividends and interest earned – which are essentially realised cash contributions. With the inclusion of Temasek into the NIR framework, there is now a long-term returns trajectory to keep up so as to meet the Government's funding needs.
While Temasek already measures its performances on Total Shareholders Returns (TSR) approach but contribute on NII basis, it is now very different now where the actual contributions are based on expected long-term real returns. The question is whether Temasek's investment strategies and portfolio management would change as a result.
Under the framework, non-realised capital gains also constitute part of the net investment returns. In addition, actual returns would also likely be different from expected long-term real returns. Hence, with the inclusion of Temasek, which would require actual cash contributions to the Government, the cash flow impact would become significant. How would the Government ensure sufficient cash generation and liquidity as our budget is essentially accounted on a cash flow basis?
Temasek holds significant stakes in companies, on behalf of the Government, that are of strategic importance to Singapore and its economy; such as Singapore Airlines, PSA, SingPower, NOL, SBST, SMRT and so on. I fully support Temasek's continued ownership in these TLCs as we want these companies to be firmly rooted to Singapore and to be aligned to our national interests and our long-term economic strategy. These companies account for a significant portion of Temasek's portfolio. The share prices and values of these companies do have its fair share of ups and downs; often due to external global market sentiments. There may be times when, for example, equity analysts would call for a "sell" in these shares due to perceived high valuations. Under the NIR framework, would the investment managers of Temasek now be more inclined to actively trade the shares of these TLCs so as to preserve the long-term returns of the portfolio?
I would be very concerned if for example they decide to sell the entire stake of SIA if they find the company's market valuation to be overly high and it is timely to lock-in on the gains.
How does the Government balance the national strategic need to hold the major stakes in certain companies versus giving Temasek the full independence to manage the valuations and returns of its portfolio?
The Net Investments Return Contribution (NIRC) has increasingly become our key revenue source rather than a budget-balancing item; which was what it is use to be and in the manner it was presented in the Annual Budget indicate that it is still a balancing item because it is always in the finer lines of the statements. But we know that NIRC is now a major contributor. Reserves are now our strategic resources and our competitive advantage and its returns reduce the need to have high taxes and allow us to invest in economic and social infrastructure even during periods of economic downturns.
However, the natural concern is whether it would lower our guard to spend prudently and sustainably given that it is a less unpopular funding source. It may breed the mentality to always look to reserves whenever we have a major spending programme.
There may also be times when the expected long-term real returns could fall over time, during prolonged periods of economic slowdowns and market slumps.
Therefore, the need to have a diversified source of sustainable revenues to fund Government's expenditures remains a vital necessity while maintaining the constant check and oversight on the prudence of our spending, especially those that are of long-term nature and those that are cross-generational implications.
As the election draws nearer, it is again not surprising to expect political parties in their bid to win over voters, to start dangling promises to spend from reserves' returns and even reserves itself. It is always so easy to come up with a very appealing election manifesto, listing the big popular items to spend and then say the money to pay for these items can come from the "reserves ATM". The fact of the matter is the NIR is already funding a major part of our capability investments as well as our social programmes. We need to retain and re-invest part of the investment returns just so that we can, at the very least, maintain the purchasing power value of our reserves, which is why the real returns is being used, as well as re-investing part of the returns for future generations.
Finally, while we debate over the Constitutional amendments as to what we should spend, how we should spend the returns, let us not forget the Pioneers and the generations thereafter that have built up the reserves painstakingly over the last few decades and now render us available this strategic and precious option. If at any time, the Government of the earlier years were less steadfast in their position, there would be less reserves for us to benefit from today.
In my view, how we judiciously and how discipline we manage and use the reserves has a direct bearing as to whether Singapore will continue to thrive and whether we have a SG100 to celebrate or not.
The still unfolding sad state of affairs for Greece is a very relevant case study for us. We could be like Greece or even worse if we badly mismanage our finances. And we have no equivalent of the EU to bail us out. So, Mdm Speaker, I support the amendments.
: Mdm Speaker, the inclusion of Temasek Holdings into our Net Investment Returns framework, first announced at this year's Budget, envisages additional monies comprising the Net Investment Returns contributions to be set aside for healthcare, transport, new Changi Terminal 5, domestic security and SkillsFuture, amongst others, all of which are aimed at improving the quality of life of Singaporeans. Including Temasek in the NIR framework allows the Government to expend the NIR for the benefit of Singaporeans. Including Temasek in the NIR framework is the right thing to do by our people who have to face a more challenging and competitive workplace and a fast changing world where the iron rice bowl has become a relic of the past. Our social safety nets require constant strengthening, improvement and upgrading. A more crowded Singapore has also stressed our infrastructure. We also need to plan for new engines of growth to power the economy and to create and take advantage of opportunities in the future.
In the same breadth, the Workers' Party acknowledges that fiscal prudence must represent a fundamental aspect of the Singapore system because Singapore does not have any natural resources. While our self-sufficiency is a virtue, we must also be careful not to make this too much of a mantra, which risks Singaporeans deserving of assistance falling through the cracks. In fact, the unpredictable marketplace of jobs and the reality of looking after loved ones, one's parents in their old age and not to mention children, are more likely to make it difficult to elegantly pigeon-hole individuals who ought to qualify for the different types of assistance currently available.
I have two questions for the Minister. The first pertains to his reply at the Budget round-up speech on liquidity management should Temasek expected long-term real returns not matched up with its actual returns. The Minister informed the House in the 2008 Debate on the NIR framework that with the inclusion of GIC and MAS, the Government does not foresee a shortage of liquid funds should this eventuality come to pass. Does the Minister foresee this prospect with the introduction of Temasek, given its different investment strategies and approaches and are there specific contingencies that have been drawn up for this purpose beyond those highlighted by the Minister in the 2008 speech?
Secondly, has the Government projected the percentage of NIR it has earmarked for the next five years, in view of Temasek's inclusion in the NIR framework? Specifically, how close or how far is the projection from the 50% threshold and how much of a buffer is estimated? Mdm Speaker, the Workers' Party supports this amendment to the Constitution.
: Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join this debate. The Amendment Bill comes almost seven years after Parliament debated the introduction of the NIRC framework for reserves invested by GIC and MAS in 2008. It has been long anticipated.
The intention of moving from the NII framework to the NIRC framework is to increase the amount of funds which the Government of the day can draw upon to finance its budget. As Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister has just explained, the increase in amount that will become available is substantial, almost 1% of GDP.
What I would like to do is to begin by revisiting the issue about the volatility of Temasek Holdings' returns and therefore the possibility of fine-tuning the percentage limit of returns that should be used for spending. Secondly, I would also like to take this opportunity to discuss how this Amendment Bill, even though it has every intention of adhering to fiscal prudence, seems to me, anyway, to be a shift away from fiscal conservatism.
During the 2008 debate on the Constitutional Amendment which first introduced the NIRC framework, the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister explained that Temasek's strategy was evolving, and that it was operating very differently compared to six years before that. Since giving the strategy room to evolve was clearly an advantage, it is not entirely clear if the current Amendment Bill takes full cognisance of the potential repercussions of the commitment it may be holding Temasek's performance to.
There are a host of risks to contend with when estimating the value of returns. Even if the investments themselves perform well, there are country risks, exchange rate risks, business cycles. Then, there are the more severe risks associated with fluctuating global economic conditions which is something Singapore will always be more exposed to than others. Finally, Mdm Speaker, there is the impact of pandemics − such as the one MERS is having on South Korea at this very moment.
Over the last few decades, Temasek has proven itself more than up to the task in taking these challenges in its stride. However, as our democracy develops, the question should also be asked as to whether there could come a time when the decision we make today becomes a burden on Temasek to deliver results. Given that Temasek's investment strategy is already challenging, will there come a time when Temasek could feel pressure, no matter how slight, to meet the demands of the growing Budget?
As Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned on more than one occasion, Temasek's returns tend to be more volatile, and can be quite high when times are good. For instance, the latest Temasek Review reports a one-year return to shareholder of 19.2%. The Review also tells us that the exposure to growth economies is 45%. In terms of geographical region, 42% is invested in Asia, excluding Singapore. In terms of sector, 28% is invested in Financial Services. These exposures are clearly borne out in the fluctuations of Temasek's net portfolio over the last 20 years. The record shows that while the over performance in terms of net portfolio value has been steadily improving, the dips caused by SARS and the global financial crisis were both sharp.
Given how much volatility has been increasing in recent years, this is surely a cause for concern, and a reason for being more cautious in tapping on Temasek's NIR. If there is recognition of the different nature of the investment remit of Temasek, should we not consider applying a different proportion of usage to the NIR of Temasek, compared to GIC? Specifically, would the Bill allow for a lower limit, say 40% rather than 50%, to be imposed on NIRC for Temasek?
The main concern with the switch from the NII framework to the NIR framework is that capital gains, unlike income earnings, are estimated rather than realised. It becomes a technical challenge to define what should be prudent access to gains from the reserves.
To address the fact that the value of the asset base moves up and down, I would like to ask if the Ministry of Finance has considered using a more conservative rule where the low end of the value in the probability distribution of the asset portfolio be used instead? Even though systems such as variance at risk are not completely reliable, they can be designed to offer more conservative estimates of value. So, my question is whether the smoothening rules that are used presently are sufficiently conservative in ensuring that a greater proportion of real reserves are preserved in the long term.
On my second point, despite the Government's reassurances that it is continuing to adhere to disciplined spending practices, I would just like to express my concern at the gathering momentum of what I perceive to be a shift away from half a century of fiscal conservatism. It is not spending itself that I am concerned with, but the inexorable shift towards large spending increases.
It is true that Singapore's spending is at a relatively low level compared to other advanced economies. For 2013, a cross-country comparison shows that among those economies for which data is available from the World Bank, Singapore ranked 46 out of 163 in terms of Government spending when measured by the General Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE). It is also true that depending on which year you choose, the growth rate in such spending could be very low for Singapore − 2014 was a case in point. But a very different picture emerges, Mdm Speaker, when we consider how this has been changing over time. In particular, I would like to point to two aspects of the change: first, the change in the ratio of Singapore's GFCE compared to those of other economies; and second, the growth rate of such spending.
I have used the same database from the World Bank that I mentioned earlier and focused on those economies for which complete data is available for the period 1975 to 2013 inclusive. The cumulative annual growth rate of GFCE for Singapore exceeded those of prominent economies like Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and even the Nordic countries. Among Nordic countries, the highest cumulative annual growth rate in constant local currency terms during this period was seen in Norway at 2.9%. This is less than half of the 6.6% increase in average annual terms that Singapore achieved. Where others spend more, they have taken time to reach a level which I believe we should not be in haste to match in much less time. Incidentally, the comparisons I had mentioned produce essentially the same result regardless of whether you carried them out using expenditures measured in constant local currency units or current US dollars. So, we should ask ourselves how much faster we want expenditures to grow and whether an even more rapid pace of growth than we have seen will really bring us closer to our objective.
Every Singaporean in distress deserves help, but the reason for more social spending should never be based merely on whether Singapore can afford to. Although many of our fellow citizens still need more help, I do not think the solution is simply for the Government to enact more social spending. Ultimately, nobody wants hand-outs − everybody wants to stand on their own.
As a matter of priority, Singapore's approach should be, I believe, to expand opportunities for everyone − especially the disadvantaged − to participate in the economy, eliminate vulnerabilities to exploitation and exposure, and emphasise that a future of self-reliance supported by the State is realisable.
It is very easy to overlook the fact that the main threat to Singapore's economy remains as it had, in the past, been unemployment. If Singapore's economy loses its relevance in the global economic order, unemployment would rise and remain elevated − that is the scenario that Singapore must counter.
The main difference between the policy shifts we see now and those of the past is that we now have more emphasis on spending increases. Spending increases − whether it is for social support or wage support − are virtually irreversible owing to the stickiness of increased reliance on such spending. You would not even be able to keep such spending increases frozen, because the calls to ensure they keep up with cost increases will be too loud to ignore.
In 2005, $579 billion was spent on "Special Transfers Excluding Top-ups to Endowment and Trust Funds". This figure grew to $4.3 billion in 2014, and is now estimated to leap to $5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. When it comes to support schemes, permanent entitlements could turn out to be exclusionary rather than inclusive. From a practical perspective, rapid increases in Government spending could lead to crowding out of the private sector, as well as cause surges in demand that the domestic supply base alone will find difficulty in meeting.
While it is true that we still have one of the lowest levels of Government spending in the world as a proportion of GDP, that is not something we need to overturn in a hurry. Indeed, it is the reason why Singapore also has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world. Together with all the other achievements we celebrate this jubilee year, these attributes have set Singapore apart during the turbulent post-Independence era, ensured that we kept pace with the leading economies of the East-Asian miracle after that, and subsequently gave us with a keen eye for external opportunities which accompanied the surge in emerging market activity after the Cold War.
Singapore was always able to do more with less. In that way, our nation carved out a unique position for itself in the region and the world. Singaporeans were always willing to do more with less, with a workforce capable of taking advantage of whatever they had at hand and learning how to do better from whomever they can. My concern is that that is changing, and a lot of these intangible qualities which contributed to Singapore's original economic success would soon be lost.
I recognise that the Government will have to continue to expand spending to prepare for the future as well as to meet the growing aspirations of Singaporeans for more social spending. Nonetheless, I hope that, as it does so, it will not only look at how much our reserves can enable us to increase spending, but also use the lessons of how much we have managed to achieve with the fiscal discipline in the past as a core guiding principle.
To conclude, just as the early generations of nation-builders did, we should continue to focus firmly on our economic security. Despite the advances Singapore has made, there remain too many challenges in this regard. In this region alone, our position as the leading global city is the dominant concern.
Although Singapore is well-placed in the region and has had a half-century of consolidation, the possibility of displacement as the leading global city in the region is not a fantasy. In ASEAN alone, the competition is significant. The five most populous ASEAN nations are also the least urbanised, and account for more than 90% of the total population of ASEAN in 2013. All of them already have leading urban metropolises. As they continue to urbanise, new better-planned metropolitan cities will be developed in these countries. Whether they become a threat or a partner to Singapore in future depends very much on how we prepare ourselves to embrace their rise.
In order to fully celebrate the achievements of 50 years of nation-building, we should also revisit the realities about Singapore's position in the world which has driven our Pioneers' sacrifices. We are competing against countries which are still able to do more with less.
The steady accumulation of Singapore's reserves has been a tribute to the toil of multiple generations of nation-builders. Any discussion about accessing the benefits of these reserves should not be too dismissive of the relevance of fiscal conservatism. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill .
: Mdm Speaker, I wish to declare that I am the CEO of Wealth Management Institute, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Temasek Group.
Madam, I rise in support of the proposed amendment to include Temasek Holdings Limited in the Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework. This amendment will widen the sources of revenue that help to fund expected increases in Singapore's future spending needs. It is tempting to look to the country's reserves whenever we need to support an increase in spending, so it is good to remind ourselves of the strategic importance of these reserves.
As our Prime Minister said in 2008, I quote: "We have no natural resources. All Members who enter this House memorise that as a catechism – no timber, no iron, no gas, no gold – just our wits and our strength and our financial reserves which we have built up. These financial reserves give people, Singaporeans and investors alike, confidence that Singapore is sound, strong and able to cope with anything which may come its way."
Singapore's reserves help underpin confidence in our country and our ability to weather storms. Any decision to draw on these reserves must be taken with great circumspection, and we must guard against any policy that is financially unsustainable, however popular it may be.
Madam, in recent years, we have seen significant increases in spending across many areas, from social programmes, housing, education, and healthcare to productivity initiatives. At the same time, the Government is projecting a lower growth trajectory in GDP, due partly to a maturing economy. We have not made enough progress in improving productivity. And an uncertain global economy will make it difficult for our Government investment agencies to sustain returns of the past. On top of that, our ageing population will increase the demand for more resources to care for the elderly. We have entered a new era of financial planning for our country. It is no longer "business as usual". As revenue streams come under pressure, our debates over spending plans should be ever more robust and informed.
For example, even as we welcome the addition of Temasek as an additional source of funds under the NIR framework, we should ensure that spending is prioritised towards investments in the country's future, or on items that will boost our capabilities and competitiveness. So, I would like to ask Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, with respect to our planning parameters, what proportion of spending is geared towards investments in national development? How are prospective projects assessed, not just on their financial viability but also on their impact on growing the country's capabilities? What mechanisms, disciplines and KPIs are in place to track "investment returns" of projects and to ensure that we "sweat our assets"?
Mdm Speaker, the Constitutional Amendment in 2008 changed the formula for computing NII, so that the Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework was applied to GIC and MAS only. Back in 2008, then Minister for Finance Tharman explained that the Government had decided not to include Temasek in the NIR framework for two reasons.
First, there were no established methodologies for projecting the long-term expected real returns on Temasek's portfolio, given its investment approach of taking concentrated stakes in companies, including direct investments.
Second, Temasek's investment strategy was still evolving, having begun a major effort to diversify its investments geographically as well as sectorally in 2002.
Can Deputy Prime Minister Tharman provide more details to the House on how the Ministry is now able to forecast the long-term expected real returns of Temasek, taking into account the nature of its investment portfolio? How has Temasek's portfolio investments evolved since 2008? Are Temasek's investment strategies expected to change in any way, as a result of coming under the NIR framework? How will the country's aggregated NIR be impacted by the inclusion of Temasek's portfolio, given that its portfolio is likely to be more volatile than those of MAS and GIC?
Madam, the NIR framework is based on a forward-looking assessment of the overall returns over the long term. The expected returns are based on an investment horizon of 20 years. I would like to ask Deputy Prime Minister Tharman about the challenges in trying to look so far ahead, given such volatile market conditions and investment climate. In today's uncertain world, many find it hard enough to forecast one year in advance, let alone 20 years. As our spending is based on expected real returns, we need some degree of confidence that the forecasting model is robust and time-tested.
Since the implementation of the NIR framework in 2008, we have also experienced an unprecedented global financial crisis with economic shocks that much of the world is still recovering from. Singapore fared relatively well, even during the darkest days of the crisis, and was even considered a safe haven in the financial world, maintaining its enviable AAA credit rating. I would like to ask if the financial crisis had any impact on the NIR framework – are there any lessons we can draw from the financial crisis that could shed light on the robustness of our framework and the investment strategies of our state investment organisations.
In addition, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to provide a comparison of the performance of MAS, GIC and Temasek against other sovereign wealth funds or government investment entities, using relevant benchmarks.
Madam, during the 2008 Constitutional amendment, the Prime Minister explained how the Government had based their level of spending on 50% of the long-term expected real returns. I quote the Prime Minister: "It is not an exact science why we came to this number, but I think 50% has a certain neatness and feels intuitively acceptable, because it underlines our commitment to continue growing our reserves, while allowing the Government to tap on part of the investment incomes for current spending. In a sense, we have put equal emphasis on both objectives – the present and the future."
May I ask the Deputy Prime Minister: under what circumstances would the percentage of 50% be up for review? Whilst a spilt down the middle would have seemed, in 2008, an equitable balance between providing for present and future needs, future circumstances may require the Government to increase their spending, say, for social programmes or other needs. So, what signposts should we be looking out for that might signal a timely review of this percentage? How soon would the Deputy Prime Minister expect us to encounter these signposts?
Madam, in closing, as we enter an era of increasing spend and diminished growth, the Net Investment Return Contribution will be a welcome source of revenue. We are fortunate to have the Nation's reserves, but must continue on the path of prudence and sustainability, for the sake of future generations. Ultimately, the focus must be on building a strong and globally competitive economy that will continue to generate strong operating revenues to meet increasing demands for expenditure. Mdm Speaker, I support the amendment.
: Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Prof Randolph Tan, Mr Pritam Singh and Ms Foo Mee Har for speaking in support of the Bill. They raised some fair questions and, indeed, these are questions which we have thought through very carefully − first in 2008 when we introduced the NIR framework and again now, when we are amending the framework to include Temasek.
There are basically three sets of issues. First, how much should we be spending and how do we spread the benefits from our reserves across generations? It is a basic question of equity − equity between generations. It is a question of our obligations to current and future generations. So, that is the first set of issues.
The second question is, having decided on the appropriate balance between spending today and spending tomorrow, how do we ensure that we do not veer from that intended balance or inadvertently overspend beyond that balance?
The third question has to do with our investment entities themselves − Temasek and GIC in particular. How do we ensure that their strategies are not compromised or shaped by this NIR framework?
Let me address each of these briefly in turn.
First, on the question of balance between spending today and spending tomorrow, what is the right balance? Our NIR framework aims to achieve a fair and judicious balance between today's needs of Singaporeans today, tomorrow's needs of today's generation of Singaporeans, and the interests of future generations.
Our reserves are basically an endowment, an endowment built up over 50 years. We should get some of the benefits of that endowment today. But we should also ensure that future generations of Singaporeans benefit from that endowment. An endowment is meant to be a permanent benefit for Singaporeans − draw some today, but ensure that future generations continue to enjoy that endowment.
And it is not just about preserving the endowment so that there will always be a stream of income coming onto the Budget for regular spending. It is also about providing security for Singaporeans.
Without any natural resources, our financial assets are a critical part of our defence against any future crisis. And we do not know what crisis it may be − it could be a financial crisis, a natural calamity, or a crisis coming out of geo-political disorder. We do not know what crisis it may be, but it is critical that we allow our reserves to grow, not excessively but to be able to grow together with our economy and future conceivable spending needs.
Is a 50% cap the right balance? Ms Foo Mee Har has just reminded us of what the Prime Minister had said in 2008 when we introduced the NIR framework. There is nothing scientific about the figure 50%. It is a judgement. It is a judgement of what is a fair balance between the needs of today and those of the future.
As I had mentioned in my speech earlier, we expect NIRC to be about 3% of GDP, with the amendment to the framework that we are proposing today. The NIR framework will also mean that we have a reasonable chance of sustaining this stream of income for spending on the Budget for many years to come. So, we will get a lift in resources, roughly speaking of about 3% of GDP, but the framework, because of its checks and balances and its safeguards, will give us a reasonable chance of sustaining this stream of income in the Budget for many years to come, rather than seeing a dwindling stream over time because we draw too much for spending today.
The second issue is whether the safeguards are in place so that we do not risk a situation where the expected returns over the long term, which is the basis for today's spending, do not materialise and we find that in the meantime, we have drawn on too much NIR monies and inadvertently overspent. It is a fair question because there is no assurance that actual returns over the long term will match expected returns. And I would like to emphasise that when we thought through the NIR system in 2008, we paid particular attention to ensuring that the system will be sustainable, and that there is no bias in favour of over-optimism in expected returns and thus the likelihood of facing a situation where actual returns are, in fact, much lower than expected returns.
There are several safeguards in our system that will ensure sustainability, and I will go through each of them briefly. First, the 50% cap itself − ensuring that at least 50% of real returns are retained in the reserves, and we do not face depletion of the reserves over time.
Second, ensuring that it is real returns and not nominal returns that we look at, so that we do not get a situation where you have high inflation globally and high nominal returns, and you spend on the basis of the nominal returns, when really what you are doing is depleting the real value of the reserves. So that is the second safeguard.
The third safeguard, which is important, is that the spending is based on investment returns on net assets, not total assets. In other words, it is based on the excess of assets over the liabilities of the Government, which includes borrowings such as SGS and SSGS. The net assets are basically the unencumbered assets, and the spending rule is based on these unencumbered assets rather than the full gross amount of the assets. We do not spend any of the returns earned on the encumbered assets, in other words, the assets that provide backing for our liabilities. And what this means is that we ensure that the full investment returns on the encumbered assets are available to cover the debt servicing costs on the liabilities.
The fourth safeguard is the smoothing of the asset base − the asset base on which we apply expected long-term returns. This means that the temporary booms and busts in the market that lead to changes in the value of our asset base are smoothed. A sudden boom in asset prices, which will happen from time to time, does not mean that we can immediately spend more through NIRC. So that is the fourth safeguard − the smoothing of the asset base.
The fifth safeguard is very important. The four safeguards I have spoken about are in the design of the NIR framework. But there is an important fifth safeguard, which is in the governance processes in the NIR framework, that also ensure that we do not spend on the basis of over-optimistic assumptions about expected returns. The process by which expected long-term real rate of returns are decided has checks and balances, and is shaped by a sense of realism about the risks in the investment world.
The process involves annual review within each of our investment entities so that the Boards can make a proposal to the Government. It is not just about the Boards coming up with a number, Government ratifying the number and the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA) and the President agreeing to the number.
It involves detailed deliberation at each stage of the process.
First, within the organisations themselves, within the investment entities – Temasek, GIC, MAS. It is a rigorous process, to project the expected rate of return over the long term, based on the views of seasoned professionals and experts. They take a long-term view, based on history as well as an assessment of the future environment, and seek not to be swayed by short-term sentiments. That is an extremely important part of the culture – not being swayed by the short-term sentiments of the markets.
The Government then decides whether to accept the Boards' proposals. We consult independent experts when necessary. And where there is significant uncertainty in the outlook, the Government will err on the conservative side when it recommends the expected rate of return to the President and the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA). The President and the members of the CPA themselves are experienced people. The CPA comprises people with very serious, proven track records in their professions and businesses. They are people who can question Government on the assumptions we are making, or the judgements we make. They can question the Government as well as the investment entities themselves.
So, the process that I have described has features which mitigate the risk of over-spending, particularly the risk of having expected returns that are above what can be realistically achieved in the markets.
What if there are persistently low actual returns, lower than expected? Well, this will in fact be reflected in the asset base, because the asset base is not based on expected returns. The asset base is based on actual returns. And if you have persistently low or negative actual returns, it will mean that the asset base grows more slowly, and that affects how much spending we can have because the expected returns are applied to that asset base. So, that is another check on the system and it constrains how much we can spend.
So, the system that I have described involves several layers, not just one layer, that amount to a strong structural safeguard in how we spend our reserves. The system helps to safeguard against over-spending based on over-optimistic expected returns.
Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Ms Foo Mee Har pointed out that the Temasek portfolio, in particular,was a more volatile one. I think there were some useful questions. Let me first say that when we designed the NIR framework, we designed it for all three entities. The 50% rule and the other features of the framework were designed for all three entities, although we first proceeded with GIC and MAS.
Assoc Prof Randolph Tan had a couple of questions and suggestions. One was whether we should apply a different spending cap to Temasek compared to GIC and MAS because Temasek has a higher risk portfolio. It is a meaningful question. We have a range of investment entities with quite different risk profiles. MAS at one end, the most conservative; Temasek at the other, which takes more concentrated stakes and is basically an equity investor, which has higher risk compared to an investor with a balanced portfolio. We can, in theory, apply different caps to each of them but I think there are merits in keeping the system simple and applying a common 50% cap to all the sources of investment income under the NIR framework and being conservative in the way we go about operating the system. I am satisfied that with the safeguards we have, that conservatism will be maintained.
I should add, in relation to Assoc Prof Randolph Tan's suggestion, that we do not look at projected values of the asset base, whether it is based on value at risk or any other way of drawing a cone of possibilities. We actually use the asset base that is based on historical values. That itself is a form of conservatism. Smoothed historical values are the asset base on which we apply our expected returns to determine spending. So, there too is some conservatism built into the system.
Next, the impact on the investment entities themselves. Will their investment strategies be influenced by the NIR framework? Ms Foo Mee Har, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Assoc Prof Randolph Tan had asked this question. I had mentioned this during the Budget debate and I will have to emphasise it again. Being included in the NIR framework does not change the investment strategies of GIC, Temasek or MAS. It leaves their strategies unaltered.
The NIR framework does not set a target rate of return for the investment entities. They have to be faithful to their mandates. Their mandates, particularly in the case of Temasek and GIC, are to invest for the long term, to aim to grow the value of their assets over the long term and to ride out short-term market cycles. They determine how much risk they can accommodate, and within that amount of risk they aim to maximise their returns over the long term.
Why are we able to take that approach of letting them focus on their mandates of investing for the long term? The reason is because our NIR framework is purely about the unencumbered assets − I explained this earlier − assets that are not matched by liabilities. And this allows both GIC and Temasek to adopt an endowment mindset − of investing for the long term and growing the value of their assets by taking advantage of opportunities that short-term investors or those who are liquidity-constrained cannot take advantage of. Overall, this approach has enabled both GIC and Temasek to perform creditably in relation to the market indices and they are both extremely well regarded amongst their peers.
What if future returns are expected to be structurally lower because of a deterioration in the investment environment? It is possible. It is entirely possible given the problems in the world today – the fiscal challenges, low productivity growth, and the possibility of disruptions in the international environment. It is possible that we have to settle for a structurally lower rate of return over the long term. If that is the case, then the Government has to adjust its spending. We will have to accept that as a reality that there will be lower expected returns, lower NIRC and we have to adjust our spending, or we have to find alternative forms of revenue through domestic sources. That is the right approach, rather than asking the investment entities to take more risks in the search for yield so that we can still get the same amount of NIRC. And that is the approach we must stick to.
Ms Foo Mee Har has asked whether we have learnt any lessons coming out of the global financial crisis. I think it has been a very useful episode. The main lesson is that spending based on expected returns instead of actual returns was the right decision. We made our amendment to the Constitution in good time. Spending based on expected returns rather than actual returns turned out to be a wise decision. It helped us to avoid going through a "feast and famine" in NIRC and in Government spending.
We all know what happened during the crisis. If we look at equity indices, say, we take the MSCI World index, it declined by almost 40% in 2008 and recovered by 31% the next year – a big crash and then a big recovery. And we would not have wanted Government spending to be shaped by those sharp gyrations in world markets. We have instead been able to avoid pro-cyclical Budgets. If you spend based on actual returns and actual returns are highly volatile, it will typically mean that you are pro-cyclical; in other words, during good times, you spend more, and during bad times, you spend less. That would not be wise from an economic policy perspective.
Liquidity is an important issue. I think Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Pritam Singh had asked about how we manage liquidity within this framework. The essential issue is this − if we are spending on the basis of expected returns, and expected returns are not matched by actual returns year-to-year, where do we get the cash in order to spend? Expected returns is the basis on which the spending rule is defined, but if actual returns vary from expected returns and, in particular, may fall well short of expected returns, where do we get the cash? And that is an important question. I had addressed it in 2008 when we introduced the NIR framework, and I touched on it briefly in this year's Budget debate as well, but I will explain it again.
First, to be very clear, this is not an issue about the spending cap. It is not an issue about investment strategies. It is purely a cashflow management issue. It does not have to do with the size of our Government Budget surplus or deficits. It is a cashflow management issue. The spending rule caps how much we can spend based on the expected returns of our investment entities. Having determined the maximum amount that we can spend, the question is whether we have got sufficient cash for that spending.
The Government has a variety of sources of cashflow from which it can meet its cash needs. These include our tax revenues which are coming in at different times during the year. It also includes funds raised outside the Budget, such as the proceeds from land sales. These land sales proceeds cannot, under our Constitutional rules, contribute to the Budget and they do not count as Government revenues. But they are part of the cashflow that the Government receives.
There is also a healthy level of Government deposits placed with MAS. A substantial amount of Government deposits placed with MAS that we can draw on when we need it, if we need it, for cashflow purposes.
The Government basically pools all its sources of cashflow, all its sources of liquidity together, and manages its cashflows as a whole through a disciplined procedure.
We have more than sufficient cash to ensure that NIRC spending based on expected returns can be met. There is hence no need, even when actual returns are weak or negative, to require the investment entities to divest existing investments in order to provide cash to the Government.
Finally, let me move on to a broader theme that came up in Members' comments, which is the whole issue of fiscal conservatism. I am glad that it was raised. Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Ms Foo Mee Har, Assoc Prof Randolph Tan, in particular, raised valid questions over how we should shape our spending priorities, and how we ensure that we are getting value out of our spending.
Our aim is not and cannot be to spend all the revenues we have. Our aim is, first and foremost, to ensure that we are spending wisely, in the interest of Singaporeans today and tomorrow. And as Assoc Prof Randolph Tan pointed out, we have got to guard against an inexorable rise in spending. He noted, and I think you will see this if you were to look at the history of social spending in many countries, that social spending only goes up, it does not come down. Unless you are forced to bring it down in a deep crisis, which is what Greece is going through, and some European countries are going through in a very painful way. Not just painful adjustments in crisis but also quite inequitable I would say, because the people who are taking the pain of budget cuts are typically the young and the poor.
So we must avoid in normal times, an inexorable increase in spending, where promises today are layered upon promises yesterday. It is what has happened in so many countries, and it is a natural tendency in society, a very human tendency for that to take place. We should guard against that and Assoc Prof Tan sounded a useful caution.
Our spending is increasing. Why is it increasing? First, because we are engaging in a major new cycle of investment in Singapore's future. In our healthcare capacity, our transport infrastructure and our human capital. It is a major new cycle of investment that I spoke about in this year's Budget, and those are the big three drivers.
We are also recalibrating and rebalancing between collective and individual responsibility, in various areas of social support – from the early years all the way to the retirement years. But the big drivers of increased spending on the Budget are healthcare capacity − because of an ageing population – transport infrastructure, and, thirdly, investing in our human capital, in Singaporeans themselves, because that is the ultimate source of strength in our society and our economy. Those are the big drivers.
We have essentially followed the life cycle of our society. Many other countries, during their younger and rapid growth years, spent the larger revenues that came up. We saved surplus revenues when there were budget surpluses in good times and during the years of rapid growth. We saved budget surpluses and did not spend them simply because they were there. This now puts us in a very strong position today. Because now, as our society goes through the second half of the life cycle – gradually getting older, and our economy is slowing down – we are now in the position of having this endowment, which we can draw on in a disciplined fashion.
Following the lifecycle of our society has been a sensible and prudent policy that we have through the years. We should never see our aim as that of looking for new spending needs and then looking for the revenues in order to meet that spending. Our aim should be, first and foremost, focused on outcomes. The real outcomes we want are: a vibrant economy that provides good jobs and careers for Singaporeans; a low tax burden on the middle income group - and it is in fact much lower than in most other countries; and a fair and equitable distribution of taxes and benefits in our society. That is what we focus on, rather than looking for new spending, and then looking for revenues to be able to meet these needs.
And I would like to assure Ms Foo Mee Har that we do take very seriously the assessment of spending effectiveness even after we have started. Our healthcare infrastructure is a very important area, where we are putting a lot of emphasis on this – the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance – on assessing the effectiveness of spending and where it should be spent. Should it be in the acute hospitals, or should we be spending more on step-down care and primary care; how do we spend in a way that truly enhances benefits for citizens, and a critical issue - how do we ensure that future treatments, particularly as technology advances, provide real value rather than just higher costs? How do you ensure that SkillsFuture, which is a major new investment in the future, will be money well spent, and not just money chasing after educational programmes? Important issue. We have got to assess our spending as we go along and ensure that they are providing value for money.
Let me conclude briefly, Mdm Speaker. First, I thank all the Members for having emphasised the need to maintain fiscal discipline. I note in particular Mr Pritam Singh's statement, that the Workers' Party supports our commitment to fiscal prudence, as a key part of the Singapore system.
Singapore has an unusual strategic advantage of having a financial endowment - the opposite of most countries' debts. For a country without natural resources, this financial endowment that we have is critical.
If we have to start from zero today, it would take us far longer to build up the reserves, and in fact, it may not even be possible at all. If we had to start today, with a population that is getting older, and an economy that is slowing down, and an international environment that is quite different, much less favourable than before, it would take us far longer to build up these reserves, or it may be not possible at all.
So this unusual strategic advantage that we have, and that our children and grandchildren will have, is something that we should cherish and protect. But remember, it is a result of deliberate, conscientious and continuous efforts of successive governments over 50 years.
As Mr Liang Eng Hwa emphasised, we must never lose the values of fiscal conservatism that got us here, and the sense of obligation to both current and future generations that our pioneer leaders bestowed on us.
Mdm Speaker, I thank you .
:
Thank you, Madam. I have a clarification for the Deputy Prime Minister. The Deputy Prime Minister mentioned in his speech that the Net Asset is the basis of calculation for NIRC. I would like to know what type of class asset is he referring to, and how does he consider "Net".
: Thank you. Well, if I could just explain this again to Mr Low. Essentially, on the Government's balance sheet, there are assets in the GIC, MAS and Temasek, and there are liabilities. Some of them have their own liabilities. For instance, the MAS issues treasury bills and Temasek issues bonds – they have their own liabilities. In addition, the Government has liabilities. It issues Singapore Government Securities. The Government also issues Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS) to the CPF Board.
We ensure that all the liabilities are deducted from the assets, so that we arrive at net assets that are the basis of what we can spend on the Budget. This way, we ensure that the investment income on the assets that match the liabilities – that provide backing for the liabilities – are fully available to meet the debt servicing cost of the liabilities. That is the first thing that we ensure.
Second, it enables us, and it enables, in particular, GIC and Temasek, as investment entities, to take an endowment mindset. They think about how to grow the endowment over the long term, as unencumbered assets, and invest for the long term. This is the privilege that we have in Singapore.

: Madam, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
In 2012, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the Financial Advisory Industry Review (FAIR) and a panel chaired by MAS was set up to explore ways to enhance the professional standing and the competence of the financial advisory industry and to create a more competitive and efficient market for the distribution of insurance policies and investment products. The panel, which includes representatives from the industry and consumer bodies, consulted the public and received over 1,300 responses and suggestions. The panel subsequently made 28 recommendations in January 2013, most of which were accepted by MAS, after another public consultation.
The proposed amendments to the Financial Advisers Act (FA Act) will give effect to the accepted recommendations made by the panel. Amendments will also be made to facilitate inspections of financial advisers by foreign regulatory authorities.
Madam, the proposed amendments should be seen in the context of the enactment of the FA Act earlier in 2002 which helped to transform the landscape for financial advisory services in Singapore. There is now greater consistency and better quality in the advisory services provided on both life insurance and investment products. Financial advisers have also made steady progress in upgrading their standards and professionalism. The FAIR initiatives will build on this foundation and put the industry on a stronger footing to meet the needs of consumers for more holistic financial advice in a more complex financial landscape.
MAS has consulted the industry and the public on the amendments. The feedback received has been carefully considered and incorporated into the Bill where appropriate.
Mdm Speaker, I will now go through the main amendments in the Bill.
The first set of changes is in relation to the remuneration structure of the financial advisory industry.
Representatives of financial advisers (FA representatives) and their supervisors are today remunerated largely based on sales performance. To better align the interests of FA representatives and supervisors with those of consumers, the Bill will require financial advisers to implement a remuneration framework that also incorporates non-sales key performance indicators (KPIs). These non-sales KPIs include assessments on whether the representative has taken steps to understand the customer's needs, recommended suitable products, provided adequate disclosures and conducted himself professionally. A significant proportion of the remuneration of FA representatives and their supervisors will depend on how well they meet the non-sales KPIs. All financial advisers will have to establish an independent sales audit unit to audit the quality of the financial advisory services provided by their FA representatives.
The Bill will also vest MAS with the powers to regulate the payment and receipt of remuneration of financial advisers, representatives and supervisors. This amendment will improve the remuneration practices of the financial advisory industry in two areas:
First, the commissions paid to FA representatives and their supervisors for sales of life insurance policies are currently heavily front-loaded, with the bulk payable in the first year of the policy. With this amendment, the Bill will limit upfront commissions and require total commissions for a life policy to be spread over a specified period. This change will create an incentive structure for FA representatives to support the continuous needs of their customers even after the purchase of a financial product.
Financial advisers and their representatives may be given short term incentives that are tied to sales of a specific investment product or type of investment product currently. Also to guard against any undue influence from these incentives in the choice of product recommendations, MAS will prohibit the industry from offering such incentives to financial advisers and their representatives. Again, this will encourage financial advisers and their representatives to focus solely on recommending products that are suitable for their customers.
These changes will better align the interests of financial advisers and their representatives with those of their customers. We are not alone in regulating the remuneration of financial advisers. Countries such as the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Australia have also moved in the same direction in recent years to better protect customers.
That is the first set of changes. The second set of changes concerns making the provision of financial advisory services a dedicated profession. To ensure that customers continue to receive good advice, it is important for financial advisers and their representatives to be primarily focused on their financial advisory roles. The Bill will allow MAS to restrict licensed financial advisers from conducting non-financial advisory activities which conflict with their financial advisory roles or result in a neglect of their financial advisory duties, or bring disrepute to the industry. This restriction would also apply to all FA representatives.
(Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]
The third set of changes will strengthen MAS' regulatory powers over insurance brokers. Currently, insurance brokers registered under the Insurance Act are allowed to provide financial advisory services upon notification to MAS. While these firms are subject to financial requirements for their insurance broking activities, no additional financial requirements are imposed on their financial advisory activities as the scale of their advisory business has been small.
However, over the past few years, there has been an increase in the number of insurance brokers expanding the scale of their financial advisory activities. And some of these insurance brokers may not have adequate financial resources to support their larger financial advisory business. To address this risk, the Bill will empower MAS to prescribe or vary the financial or professional indemnity insurance requirements for insurance brokers which are similar to those currently imposed on licensed financial advisers.
The Bill will also empower MAS to approve inspections of financial advisers in Singapore by their foreign parent regulatory authorities, and such inspections will allow foreign regulatory authorities to carry out effective consolidated supervision of financial groups headquartered in their jurisdictions.
Sir, these amendments to the FA Act are part of MAS' efforts to strengthen the financial advisory industry so that it can continue to grow with the changing needs of customers. MAS will work with the industry to uphold the image of a highly competent and professional workforce, able to cope with fast-evolving market and technological changes, and dedicated to meeting consumers' needs. Sir, I beg to move.
Question proposed.
:
Mr Deputy Speaker, in Mandarin.
Mr Deputy Speaker, firstly I would like to declare that I am the President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry. After thoroughly understanding the Financial Advisers (Amendment) Bill by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, I am very pleased with three positive areas.
The first is establishing non-sales KPIs by the financial institutions, enabling their financial advisers to concentrate on the customers' actual needs, and improving on service quality, rather than aggressively promoting products and services to achieve sales KPIs with no concern for professional ethics. Secondly, it is to put in stringent measures to regulate other types of business that financial advisers can engage in concurrently, in order to avoid any conflicts between the products they represent personally and their financial advisory services. Thirdly, it is to work with stakeholders to establish a specialised web portal to list life insurance products offered by different life insurance companies. This would enable the consumers to make an easy comparison without the help from financial advisers.
These three fundamental amendments could reduce the tendency for financial advisers to aggressively push their financial products to clients in order to chalk up individual KPI and increase their income, and facilitate building up a pool of consumers with clearer mindset for self-help services. These improvements are good learning points for other Government agencies.
Upselling also exists in the application for Government assistance schemes. As many local SMEs are unfamiliar with the preparation of documents and filling in application forms, they tend to outsource the work to consultants. Last year, 44,000 SMEs applied for the Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme (PIC), representing a 21% increase over the 2011 figures. Such good results must be attributed to the efforts of consultants.
However, some unscrupulous consultants who are keen to clinch a business deal may not care to understand the companies' actual needs; instead, their approach is to promote the products and services aggressively and persuade the client to apply for the government assistance scheme. Let me cite two actual cases, which are in fact failures. At the end of last year, a shop owner was persuaded by a consultant to sign an agreement to let the consultant design a Facebook page for market expansion, and spent a grand total of $15,000! Why did it cost $15,000? Apparently, $15,000 is the overall cap for the PIC Bonus. This happened to be the "special package" designed by the consultant to help enterprises "get money" from the Government. Some consultants even give enterprises a "rebate". The clueless SME boss was made to buy a cheap product at a high price, much to his chagrin.
Another gentleman, Mr Koh, fell into the same trap when he encountered an unscrupulous consultant. Last year, he appointed a consultant to help him buy a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, to store customer data, and record performance of his sales people. The consultant also charged $15,000, inclusive of the service fee and purchase of hardware and software. However, Mr Koh discovered that this system was incompatible, and he had no choice but to revert to using Excel to manage the customer database. Due to work requirements, he is still looking for a suitable system, and I hope he could find the right product soon.
In reality, SMEs could approach the SME Centres to help them apply for government assistance schemes. Government agencies have already streamlined their procedures, and the process is not all that complicated. Just like the specialised web portal to be launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, government assistance schemes from different government agencies can be found in the EnterpriseOne portal. However, the EnterpriseOne portal lists much detailed content on government assistance schemes, including the programmes of many government agencies. SMEs would need more time to digest all the information and select schemes deemed more applicable. Since the Government mooted the productivity drive, schemes that are most well-received and have the highest take-up rate have been frequently featured in the media. SMEs can take note of these news reports, and decide on which schemes would suit them best.
How do we prevent Government policies from being abused? I believe we could learn from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, trace the problem and get to the root cause. We should see what motives and mechanisms have caused the companies to pursue monetary gains instead of upgrading and restructuring.
Every year, newspaper reports tell us that "the government has set aside an amount of budget to support enterprises embarking on certain programmes." Many programmes would be reported in this manner: "The following scheme benefited x number of enterprises, and the total funds utilised were X dollars." From observing such news reporting, I wonder if Government agencies are using monetary grants as a selling point when helping enterprises upgrade. In time to come, business advisers will be inclined to be money-conscious, so will enterprises, and eventually everyone would concentrate on financial gains.
Upgrading of enterprises requires financial support, just as patients need blood transfusion. However, blood transfusion is not a permanent solution. Successful enterprises have to learn how to generate their own blood. Similarly, besides supporting enterprises financially, the government could also consider other measures. Today, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has proposed establishing Non-sales KPIs, and I believe this would steer the financial advisers away from merely focusing on the monetary value. I hope other Government agencies could also follow this practice.
In closing, I support the Financial Advisers (Amendment) Bill.
Mr Deputy Speaker Sir, I support the Bill.
: Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill as it raises professional standards across the Financial Advisory (FA) industry. Nonetheless, I have several queries.
I do not think it can be disputed that many of us, even those with higher education, know very little about investment or financial products, and especially their risks.
Statistics indicate that poor or insufficient financial advice is a cause for concern in Singapore. Despite the disproportionately large no of FA representatives in Singapore compared to other countries, Singaporeans are under-insured and under-prepared for retirement. A 2013 survey shows that more than half of Singaporeans lack adequate insurance. And a 2014 survey shows that only a quarter of Singaporeans are following a retirement plan for financial needs, another quarter are working out their plans, while the rest have no concrete ideas at all. Then, there is the 2012 MAS Mystery Shopper survey which indicates that much of the advice dispensed by FA representatives is less than satisfactory: of the recommendations solicited, only 28% were suitable, while 40% may be suitable and 30% were plainly unsuitable.
The extent of our knowledge is usually what we are told by the FA representative, and they tend to focus on the upsides of an investment. We can, of course, read the fine print or do our own research, but most of us will not. So, while this Bill seeks to give more protection to the consumer, we must continue to remind them that this Bill will not eliminate risks or bad practices, and that they need to protect themselves by either asking questions or finding out more about the investments they enter into.
It runs contrary to the Bill's purpose for representatives who do in fact advise and influence unsophisticated clients to be allowed to avoid responsibility. In this regard, I have a concern that the intent of the Bill may be undermined by exclusion clauses. The Bill prescribes minimum standards for non-sales key performance indicators, the fulfilment of which affects the FA representatives' remuneration. However, these minimum standards can be contracted out of. For example, a FA representative may ask his client to sign a document stating that he only wants to receive product advice or that the transaction is "execution only". In such a case, it would seem that the representative cannot be taken to task for unsuitable recommendations or for poor after-sales service.
Next, I wish to clarify the scope of section 23B, which makes Financial Advisory a dedicated profession. Section 23B introduces a new requirement that a representative must work exclusively as a FA representative unless the conditions prescribed under section 104 are fulfilled. The breach of this and related provisions is an offence. It is not clear on the face of the Bill what the purpose of this restriction is. One likely reason is to prevent a conflict of interest. An example is where a FA representative cum property agent improperly recommends that a client purchase an investment property instead of for further insurance because the former gives him a higher commission. But in other situations, the conflict may be less clear or less probable. I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate on the requirements that will be prescribed under section 104. Will there be a blanket ban on FA representatives holding another job? And what other mischief does the provision target?
My last point is a broader one on the FA industry in Singapore. The Bill tackles the problem from one angle: that of the financial advisers and their representatives. The Bill realigns incentives by improving the remuneration structure to promote fair dealing. It extends its reach to supervisors and also makes financial advisory a dedicated profession. But the best protection is really a well-informed consumer.
The question therefore is whether we should do more to improve the financial literacy of Singaporeans. Singaporeans must be alert to the need for insurance and retirement planning, and able to sniff out deals which are too good to be true. One danger is that once we have these regulations in place, people will assume that all FAs are regulated and that they therefore have nothing to fear. That will certainly not be the case. I wonder if the Minister has plans to tackle this aspect of the problem.
Tackling the problem from consumer's perspective also means enabling consumers who are dissatisfied with financial advisory services to seek redress. In this regard, consumers may turn to the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC) to resolve their disputes. FIDReC deals with insurance claims up to a sum of $100,000 and with claims against banks, capital markets disputes and other claims up to a sum of $50,000. I would like to ask the Minister how many cases FIDReC handles each year, and more importantly, if there are a plans to expand FIDReC's jurisdiction so that disputes can be handled quickly and with lower costs. With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.
: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members for their points and I thank Mr Thomas Chua for his support of the Bill. He spoke on several useful points on SMEs, not entirely directly relevant to the Bill, but I think these are useful points and feedback on SMEs which our economic agencies will certainly find useful. He also suggested that other agencies can learn from MAS and I am sure MAS will be happy to share its experience. I also agree with him that compensation models do shape behaviour and that is the key reason why MAS is introducing its new remuneration framework that incorporates non-sales KPIs so that the focus of financial advisory representatives will not be solely on sales.
I would also like to thank Mr Hr Kumar for supporting the Bill and I will address the questions he has raised.
First, on the point about consumers having the option to request only product advice or "execution-only" services from the FA representatives. This flexibility is indeed available today. It caters to customers who are more sophisticated or who want to opt out of receiving financial advice. Nevertheless, MAS will take regulatory actions against any FA representatives found to have abused this flexibility to influence unsophisticated customers to purchase unsuitable products.
There are also a few safeguards to deter and detect such behaviours by FA representatives. First of all under the new remuneration framework, the checks to be conducted on FA representatives will include an assessment of whether they have undertaken the necessary due diligence to understand their customers' investment objectives, financial condition, and personal needs. FA representatives who fail to conduct such due diligence, could suffer cuts in their remuneration.
Second, for the more unsophisticated or vulnerable customers, supervisors of FA representatives are required to call such customers after each transaction to ensure they have not been unduly influenced by their FA representatives to purchase unsuitable products.
Third, such abuses may be detected through mystery shopping exercises which are conducted regularly and the Financial Advisers are expected to do so. These safeguards are all subject to MAS' supervisory oversight and MAS will work closely with the FA industry and consumer bodies to assess if further safeguards are necessary.
The Member also asked about the scope of section 23B of the FA Act, and I would like to clarify that MAS has no intention of imposing a "blanket ban" on FA representatives holding another job. FA representatives may hold another job, provided the job does not conflict with their financial advisory roles, result in the neglect of their financial advisory duties or bring disrepute to the industry. In consultation with the industry and consumer bodies, MAS has identified four specific jobs that FA representatives are not allowed to engage in. These are: selling real estate, money-lending, promoting junkets for casinos and marketing products that are not regulated under the FA Act. These jobs are clearly in conflict with financial advisory activities. For example, MAS has received complaints against FA representatives who use their regulatory status, to market questionable schemes in products which do not accord safeguards to customers under the FA Act. So MAS will monitor the situation and expand the list of prohibited jobs where appropriate.
Mr Hri Kumar also asked about the annual case load handled by the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC) and whether there are any plans to expand FIDReC's jurisdiction. Since the launch of FIDReC's operations 10 years ago, it has handled an average of 855 complaints each year. FIDReC's jurisdictional claims limits were set to cover the majority of retail transactions. FIDReC can already take on cases that exceed its jurisdictional limits if the financial institution agrees to allow FIDReC to hear the claim. Nevertheless, I would like to assure the Member that MAS and FIDReC will keep the jurisdictional limits under review to ensure that FIDReC continues to provide an affordable alternative dispute resolution scheme that covers the majority of retail transactions.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the amendments to the FA Act will raise the standards and professionalism of the financial advisory industry to better serve the changing needs of customers. But ultimately customers must take responsibility for their financial decisions. I fully agree with the Member that the best protection is a well-informed customer.
MAS has been and will continue to work with the industry and other Government agencies to enhance financial literacy among Singaporeans. The centrepiece of our efforts is Money SENSE, which is the national financial education programme. Through MoneySENSE, we provide financial education through diverse channels, customised to the needs of different segments of society, in order to raise the overall financial capabilities of all Singaporeans.
For example to reach out to Singaporeans in the heartlands, MoneySENSE has been organising road shows at public libraries and community centres using games, talks and info-displays to disseminate financial messages. These programmes provide guidance, tools and checklists to help customers and consumers assess their financial needs including insurance and investment needs.
In addition, we will be launching an education campaign soon, to remind Singaporeans about the importance of saving and investing for the future, and to introduce low-cost options like Exchange Traded Funds and the upcoming Singapore Savings Bonds. So, campaigns like these also have a role to play in encouraging consumers to learn more about their financial choices and plan ahead for their financial well-being.
Sir, I believe I have addressed the points and queries raised by the Member and I thank all of them for the support of the Bill.
Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lawrence Wong].
Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.
: Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
The House has just passed the Financial Advisers (Amendment) Bill 2015. The changes proposed in the Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2015 are to complement the changes proposed in the Financial Advisers (Amendment) Bill 2015.
MAS has consulted the industry and the public on the proposals, and incorporated the feedback received into the Bill where appropriate.
First, the Bill introduces amendments to effect the recommendation to limit upfront commissions and spread the total commissions paid on a life policy over a specified period. I had mentioned that earlier in my speech. So, these amendments mirror those proposed in the Financial Advisers (Amendment) Bill 2015.
Second, to facilitate the comparison of life policies, MAS has collaborated with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), the Life Insurance Association and MoneySENSE to launch a web aggregator for life insurance policies. The web aggregator, known as compareFIRST, is an Internet portal that enables consumers to compare the premiums, key benefits and features of life policies from different insurers. You can go online, check out what are the options available and do a very easy comparison. It helps consumers to make better informed decisions when purchasing life insurance products.
The Bill will empower MAS to require insurers to submit information for the web aggregator and to specify the fees payable by insurers for the development, operation and maintenance, and use of the web aggregator.
Third, the Bill will empower MAS to prescribe matters relating to the manufacture and offer of life policies, such as their characteristics, benefits and manner of distribution or sale, where it is in the public interest to do so. For example, MAS will be able to require insurers to manufacture and offer Direct Purchase Insurance (DPI) products. DPI products are simple life policies that consumers can purchase directly from insurers without commissions and financial advice. With DPI, consumers will have cheaper access to selected term life and whole life policies.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the initiatives that these amendments will give effect to will help to raise the standards and professionalism of the financial advisory industry, and lead to greater efficiency in the distribution of life policies. Sir, I beg to move.

: Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."
Bankruptcy refers to the legal process whereby the debts that a person is unable to pay are resolved. The bankruptcy regime serves a number of objectives.
First, it provides an orderly regime for the resolution of unpaid debts.
Second, in so doing, the regime balances the interests of debtors, creditors and the wider society in the following ways. It ensures that bankrupts are held accountable for their debts, but allows them to make a fresh start in their financial matters after a reasonable period of time; and it provides incentives for creditors not to over-extend credit and for debtors not to borrow more than they can repay.
The Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill furthers these objectives while ensuring that public resources are utilised more efficiently.
The Bill introduces four key sets of amendments:
First, it raises the debt threshold for obtaining a bankruptcy order;
Second, it allows creditors to make an expedited bankruptcy application;
Third, it requires or incentivises creditors to appoint private trustees in certain circumstances; and
Fourth, it introduces a "differentiated discharge" regime to allow bankrupts to be discharged within clear timeframes.
The Bill also contains a number of miscellaneous amendments.
As bankruptcy procedures are fairly technical, let me first begin by explaining how the process works under the current law.
A debtor, or his creditors, may apply for a bankruptcy order. In either case, it must be shown that the debtor is unable to pay his debts as they fall due and that such debts amount to at least $10,000. The Bankruptcy Act provides that a debtor is presumed to be unable to pay his debts if, having been served with a statutory demand, he does not settle it or set it aside, within 21 days.
Even if a debtor meets the requirements for being made a bankrupt, he may be eligible for the Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS). The DRS, which was introduced in 2009, allows debtors to avoid bankruptcy if they meet certain eligibility criteria. It also allows creditors to receive no less than what they would have, had the debtor been made a bankrupt. The DRS is being reviewed, but no changes are presently being made to it.
If a bankruptcy order is made, the bankrupt's property will vest in a trustee in bankruptcy, or the "trustee". The trustee may either be the Official Assignee (OA) or a private trustee appointed by the court. The trustee performs the following functions in administering the bankruptcy:
First, the trustee will investigate the bankrupt's financial affairs to ascertain what is available for distribution.
Second, the trustee will adjudicate the proofs of debt filed by creditors, to determine which debts are valid and how much is owed to each creditor.
Third, the trustee will realise the property available for repayment, including any property acquired or contributed by the bankrupt, after the bankruptcy order is made.
Fourth, if there are sufficient funds, the trustee will declare a dividend in respect of the debts proved.
A bankruptcy terminates when the bankruptcy order is discharged or annulled. A bankruptcy order may be annulled by the court or by a certificate issued by the OA, if, for example, all the relevant debts and expenses have been fully repaid. Alternatively, the bankruptcy order may be discharged by the court or by the OA's certificate, thus releasing the debtor from all the debts provable in the bankruptcy, apart from debts due to the Government.
With this general framework in mind, let me now explain the key amendments in the Bill.
The first key amendment relates to raising the debt threshold before a bankruptcy application may be made in court.
Presently, a bankruptcy application can only be made if the debtor owes at least $10,000 in debts. This threshold was introduced in 1999. It is timely to review the threshold given the rate of inflation over the past years. The Bill, therefore, raises the debt threshold to $15,000.
The second key amendment is to introduce an expedited bankruptcy procedure.
Earlier, I had explained that a debtor is presumed to be unable to pay his debts if he does not respond to a statutory demand within 21 days. Presently, a creditor must wait until the end of the 21-day period before he can make a bankruptcy application. Clauses 14 and 15 of the Bill allow a creditor to make an expedited bankruptcy application after the statutory demand has been served, but before the 21-day period has expired. However, the creditor must show a serious possibility that the debtor's property, or the value of all or any of the debtor's property, will be significantly diminished before the 21-day period ends.
The amendments are being introduced because, currently, a creditor can only appoint an interim receiver or prevent the bankrupt's property from being transferred after a bankruptcy application has been filed, which can only be done after the 21-day period has expired. There is a risk that the debtor could dissipate his assets during this 21-day period. The amendments will, therefore, allow the creditor to take steps to preserve assets available for distribution to the creditors at an earlier stage, although the bankruptcy order will only be made upon the expiry of the 21-day period. This is to ensure that the debtor will still have the full 21-day period to settle or set aside the statutory demand.
The third set of amendments requires or incentivises institutional creditors to appoint private trustees to administer some bankruptcies.
Currently, it is not mandatory to appoint a private trustee to act as the trustee in bankruptcy. As a result, private trustees are seldom appointed, and the OA acts as the trustee in over 99% of bankruptcies. This includes those cases where the value of the bankrupt's estate is insufficient to cover the OA's costs. At present, creditors have no incentive to consider the costs of administering a bankruptcy before applying to make a debtor bankrupt.
This is unsatisfactory, because the State bears the cost of resolving debts entered into between private parties, and often, for the benefit of private parties. As such, the amendments seek to ensure better utilisation of public resources.
Clause 6 provides that a creditor must apply for a private trustee to be appointed at the time of making a bankruptcy application, under two circumstances.
First, where the creditor making the application is an institutional creditor or its subsidiary.
Second, where the debt, when incurred, was payable to an institutional creditor or its subsidiary. So, for example, where the debt was originally incurred to a bank, the bank assigns the debt to someone who is not an institutional creditor and the latter institutes bankruptcy proceedings.
An "institutional creditor" is defined as a bank or finance company that is licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore or a business undertaking with more than $100 million in annual sales turnover and more than 200 employees.
So, take, for example, where a debtor has incurred debts from two sources, namely, a bank and a personal loan from a friend. If the debtor is unable to pay his debts, he may be made bankrupt in one of three ways:
First, if the bank makes the bankruptcy application. In this scenario, the bank would have to nominate a private trustee before the court will grant the bankruptcy order;
Second, if the personal creditor makes the bankruptcy application. In such a case, there is no need to nominate a private trustee;
Third, if the debtor files the bankruptcy application himself. In this case, he will not need to nominate a private trustee either.
Where no private trustee is appointed by the court, the OA will administer the bankruptcy. However, in such a case, clause 37 provides that where at least half of the value of the bankrupt's debts is owed to institutional creditors or their subsidiaries, the OA may issue a written notice to inform all the creditors to consider applying for the appointment of a private trustee in place of the OA.
Any creditor can apply to appoint a private trustee. If a creditor chooses to do so, the costs and expenses of appointing the private trustee will affect the eventual returns on the debts.
But if the creditors choose not to do so, the OA is not required to incur further expenses to administer the bankruptcy, other than that related to the payments made by the bankrupt under the new differentiated discharge framework.
In the converse situation, where less than half of the value of the bankrupt's debts is owed to institutional creditors, the OA will administer the bankruptcy in full until its conclusion.
Presently, it is common for the OA to administer bankruptcies where the value of the estate is insufficient to cover the OA's costs which results in the taxpayers bearing such costs where there is little prospect of recovery. These amendments will encourage institutional creditors, who have sufficient resources and expertise to make credit assessments, to carefully consider whether to apply for a bankruptcy order. They will also encourage institutional creditors to be more prudent in extending credit and allow the OA's resources to be better utilised elsewhere
The Bill also contains some consequential amendments relating to the appointment of private trustees.
First, a private trustee may resign only if he nominates another private trustee who has consented to act, or if the OA consents in writing to the appointment. This ensures that a private trustee will see through the administration of the bankruptcy, unless the OA consents to take over.
Second, a private trustee has to provide security to the OA, to ensure that he performs his duties and duly observes all the requirements of the Act. The Bill introduces a new provision allowing the OA to forfeit the security furnished where the private trustee fails to comply with statutory timelines.
I will now explain the fourth set of key amendments, which introduces the differentiated discharge framework.
This framework addresses one of the key concerns that bankrupts have, namely, when they can be discharged from bankruptcy.
Presently, there are two ways for a person to be discharged from bankruptcy.
First, by an order of court. There is no change to this process.
Second, by the OA's certificate. However, the OA's certificate can currently only be issued three years after the bankruptcy order was made, and if the debts proved in bankruptcy do not exceed $500,000.
This monetary cap fetters the OA's ability to discharge bankrupts in deserving cases. Clause 42 of the Bill removes this condition and introduces a differentiated discharge framework that will provide all bankrupts with greater certainty as to when they are eligible to be discharged. Let me explain the key features of this new framework.
The new framework provides bankrupts with clear goals and timelines to meet, in order to become eligible for a discharge. Whether a bankrupt is eligible for discharge depends on whether he has paid the target contribution, which refers to the total amount contributed to the estate from the bankrupt's income or from third parties. The trustee will calculate the target contribution at the early stages of bankruptcy so that the bankrupt knows upfront the targets that he will have to meet in order to be eligible for discharge.
The framework will allow bankrupts who pay their target contribution expeditiously to be eligible for discharge earlier. With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I ask the Clerks to distribute copies of the infographic explaining the differentiated discharge framework to the Members?
: Yes, I give my consent [
A document was distributed to hon Members
].
: Thank you. As Members will see from the infographic, there are three relevant time periods. For a first-time bankrupt:
(a) He is eligible to be discharged after three years in bankruptcy if he has paid the target contribution in full. However, a discharge will not be granted if sufficient creditors object to it.
(b) He is eligible to be discharged after five years in bankruptcy if he has paid his target contribution in full. Objecting creditors will need to obtain a court order to prevent the bankrupt from being discharged.
(c) If a bankrupt has not paid the target contribution in full, he will be eligible for discharge after seven years. Likewise, a court order must be obtained to prevent a bankrupt from being discharged.
Bankrupts may also be discharged at the three- or five-year mark even if they have not paid the target contribution in full, if there are extenuating circumstances such as a debilitating illness.
For a repeat bankrupt, all the timelines I mentioned will be extended by two years as compared to a first-time bankrupt.
To address any concerns that bankrupts who have not paid their target contribution in full will be eligible for discharge, the OA will keep a public register containing a list of undischarged and discharged bankrupts. Only those who pay their target contributions in full will have their records expunged from the register five years from the date of discharge. For those who do not, their names will remain on the register permanently. This will also allow future creditors to make informed decisions on whether to extend credit.
There are two further important points about the differentiated discharge framework that I need to highlight:
First, bankrupts need to file their statement of affairs and any supplementary information on time. This is because the timeline for reckoning a bankrupt's eligibility to be discharged does not start until these documents are filed. The later a bankrupt files these documents, the later the timeline will start to run.
Second, the timeline will be suspended if the bankrupt travels or remains overseas without the trustee's permission. Bankrupts should not be allowed to benefit under this new framework if they fail to comply with their obligations under the law.
This framework introduces a new rehabilitative regime which gives bankrupts clear timeframes and goals to meet in order to become eligible for discharge. Co-operative bankrupts will be incentivised to make sufficient contributions to achieve an earlier discharge, but at the same time the framework has sufficient safeguards, in the form of permanent bankruptcy records and the OA's and the Courts' discretion to extend the bankruptcy, to prevent moral hazard.
I will now touch briefly on some of the miscellaneous amendments in the Bill.
Clause 27 requires a bankrupt's creditor to file a proof of debt within four months from the date that the administration of the differentiated discharge framework begins, unless the time period is extended by the court, or by the trustee in certain circumstances. This will provide bankrupts' creditors with greater certainty as to the value of their debts, and also will facilitate the smooth administration of the bankruptcy.
Clause 37 provides that the OA will not be required to incur further expenses unless there is sufficient available property in the bankrupt's estate. This ensures that the bankrupt's estate will not be unnecessarily depleted. Any creditor may apply to the court to direct the OA to incur a particular expense, but only on the condition that the creditor indemnifies the OA and provides reasonable security to secure the indemnity.
Clause 49 provides that the offence of fraudulent disposal of property will be committed only if the bankrupt had the intention to defraud his creditors or to deprive his creditors of the property in the event of a bankruptcy order. Clause 51 introduces a new offence, which is committed when a bankrupt provides a guarantee, indemnity or security of at least $1,000 without disclosing that he is an undischarged bankrupt at that time.
The Bill contains a comprehensive suite of changes aimed at improving the bankruptcy regime. The changes are targeted at ensuring that public resources are better utilised, while providing greater certainty as to when bankrupts are eligible to be discharged and ensuring that the Act remains up-to-date.
The Bill strikes a balance between the need to hold the bankrupt accountable, while ensuring that bankrupts have the opportunity to make a fresh start in their financial affairs after a reasonable period of time. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.
Question proposed.
: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. We have over 20,000 cases of undischarged bankrupts in Singapore, with about 1,500 to 1,900 new cases filed every year.
According to the Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office, the leading causes of bankruptcy in Singapore are overspending, business failure and unemployment. The Credit Bureau Singapore also reported that borrowing by individuals had increased over the years.
It is important that the Government puts in place measures to encourage financial prudence and prevent borrowers from over-leveraging. Continuous public education is necessary to remind Singaporeans of the benefits of financial discipline so that they will be prudent and not borrow beyond their means.
I support measures such as the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework and so-called financial restrictions of motor vehicle loans by MAS.
The Credit Bureau also plays a role in helping borrowers and lenders manage debts and risks.
Schemes, such as the Debt Repayment Scheme and the Repayment Assistance Scheme administered by the Official Assignee and Credit Counselling Singapore respectively, are also useful in helping individuals reduce their debts gradually and in a feasible manner.
The Bill proposes to raise the minimum debt level for debtors to be made bankrupt from $10,000 to $15,000. The Ministry has pointed that the intention of this amendment is to get lenders and borrowers to resolve more debts without resorting to a bankruptcy application or petition. In addition, the amount takes into consideration inflation.
My concern is that the higher limit may encourage lenders to try to get individuals to borrow more than what they need. There is also the possibility that lenders will upload their costs to meet the minimum amount.
May I suggest that the Government consider setting up another institution or registrar as a long-term solution to administer smaller defaulters through a simpler and economical framework. It is important to impress upon the individuals to take personal responsibility and exercise self-discipline for their personal finances. Raising the limit may send the wrong signal to them.
Next, I would like to voice my support for the amendment which will allow bankrupts to be discharged according to a set timeframe.
This is a more transparent approach than the current framework under which there are no specific criteria and discharge is granted only by the High Court or Official Assignee on a case-by-case basis.
Under the new framework, debtors will be encouraged to work towards resolution and closure. At least they will know when they can see the light at the end of the tunnel. With that, I support the amendment.
:Mr Deputy Speaker, over the years, I have encountered residents who were made bankrupts due to business failure, or simply because they were trying to help a relative by signing off as guarantor for a loan. They languished for many years in their status, with diminished career prospects and demoralised, as either the debt was too large or they were simply unable to make sufficient payment to satisfy their creditors.
I am thus supportive of the Bill's purpose of seeking to inject some efficiency and timelines into bankruptcy administration. I also welcome the increase in the bankruptcy debt threshold from $10,000 to $15,000, in view of the rise in costs since the threshold was last set.
However, I wish to seek some clarifications on two areas, namely, private trustees, and the time limits for discharge of bankrupts.
First, private trustees. I note that the Bill requires "institutional creditors" to nominate a private trustee in place of the Official Assignee (OA) when bringing a bankruptcy application. The "institutional creditors" include banks and finance companies regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and business undertakings with annual turnover of more than $100 million and more than 200 employees.
Over the past few years, I have come across several residents in bankruptcy who complained about slow responses from the OA's office. I hope that this proposal of private trustees taking over significant workload from the OA will improve the response times and efficiency of bankruptcy administration overall.
One potential issue I wish to raise relates to the costs of private trustees. Under the Act, the fees of the private trustees are to be borne by the bankrupts. This will be an item added to the debt under the bankruptcy. The private trustees' costs will be paid from the bankrupts' monies and properties, in priority to creditors' claims.
Will the additional burden of high private trustees' fees delay or hinder the bankrupts' rehabilitation and discharge? I am thinking of certain scenarios, for example, where a bankrupt owes a small debt of say, $20,000 – how much additional fees would be added for him to pay by way of private trustee's charges? High trustee's charges could also come at the expense of creditors' recovery, since the trustee's charges will be paid in priority to creditors' claims.
Furthermore, it is foreseeable that institutional creditors such as banks may appoint larger law firms or accounting firms as private trustees. These larger firms' fees generally are much higher than smaller firms' fees. Should there be some regulation or capping of private trustees' fees to ensure that they are proportionate to the debt or, at least, reasonable and necessary?
Besides their fees, I would like clarification on how the private trustees will be held accountable for their work.
Under section 39 of the Act, the OA has supervision over the private trustee in that the OA will take cognisance of the conduct of a private trustee, inquire into any complaint made and conduct investigations where needed. In addition, according to a MinLaw explanatory note on the Bill, once a bankruptcy exceeds its five-year mark or seven-year mark in the case of repeat bankruptcies, a private trustee will have to submit reports to the OA every year. I would like the Ministry to confirm that a bankrupt does not need to wait for the five- or seven-year mark respectively before making a complaint to the OA.
In addition, before complaining to the OA, the bankrupt may want to resolve matters with the private trustee first. If such residents were to come to see their Members of Parliament for assistance, should Members write to the private trustee directly, or should such correspondences be channelled through the OA's office? Is the private trustee expected to reply to Members' letters?
Next, Sir, time frames for discharge. The Bill sets out a differentiated discharge framework, with time frames for discharge of bankruptcy: for first time bankrupts, they are generally eligible for discharge in five to seven years, while repeat bankrupts are generally eligible for discharge in seven to nine years. Under this framework, bankrupts are told that they should keep up their monthly contributions to reach the Target Contribution, so as to be discharged earlier rather than later. However, bankrupts who have not paid their Target Contributions in full may still be discharged after seven years for first-time bankrupts and nine years for repeat bankrupts.
I see the benefit of this framework of injecting more certainty for bankrupts to work towards their discharge. Nevertheless, I note that the periods of time proposed are long compared with some countries. One example at the other end of the spectrum is the United Kingdom, where bankrupts are automatically discharged after one year to promote rehabilitation of bankrupts and to encourage entrepreneurs to try again. While having a regime of one year automatic discharge is probably too drastic a change and unfair to creditors, how did the Government arrive at the time frames it decided upon?
Secondly, under the differentiated framework of this Bill, repeat bankrupts are treated more harshly compared with first-time bankrupts. Repeat bankrupts would have to pay 76 monthly contributions to meet their Target contribution, compared with 52 monthly payments for first-time bankrupts.
Would the Ministry be able to tell us whether there are significant numbers of repeat bankrupts, or give other indications of the size of the problem, to warrant such a blanket treatment for all repeat cases?
Mr Deputy Speaker, firstly I wish to declare that I am the President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry. I support the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill, as it will prescribe a minimum period that a bankrupt can be discharged. This would benefit those who have failed in their ventures to learn their lessons, and start all over again.
Currently, Singapore's economy is undergoing a period of restructuring, and we do need more entrepreneurs who have ideas and creative thinking to develop economic avenues and new ways of doing business. We also need to groom more young entrepreneurs to be daring enough to venture, and not give up easily even when they face obstacles. The business battlefield is surely not going to be plain sailing. Even renowned entrepreneurs like Jim Rogers and Jack Ma have experienced failure, and not only once.
Does our society have the environment to nurture entrepreneurship? Recently, I participated in a seminar entitled "The role of parent education in preparing young people for employment" by the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC); the results of one survey that were announced deserve further thought. A total of 550 parents participated in this survey which was mainly to find out how parents could prepare their children for employment. Results showed that the capability parents valued most is to cultivate their children's specialised skills and knowledge learning capacity. Parents felt that the least important is to cultivate in their children the willingness to take risks.
These results show that the tolerance level for risk-taking needs to be further increased in our society; a variety of reasons lead to parents making more emphasis on knowledge acquisition and skills. While this is certainly a good thing, the young people groomed under this mindset could turn out to be excellent civil servants, managers, and outstanding skilled workers and professionals, but are not likely to become successful entrepreneurs.
Starting a business entails taking risks. Let me cite a real example: Mr Tan, who was a restaurant owner, became bankrupt a few years ago. He was not used to working for others, and wanted to continue doing business. Hence, he used his wife's name to re-register a business and started to sell fish soup. As he learned from his previous experience, the business became better and better, and he opened another stall at a nearby hawker centre. Because he has already mastered the specialised skill of slicing fish, of late Mr Tan hopes to expand his business through opening a chain, but because he was still an undischarged bankrupt, he faced hindrances at every turn – rejections in discussing projects, getting bank loans, and applying for Government assistance schemes. He really hopes that the Government could show more leniency towards bankrupts.
After the amendment to the Bankruptcy Act, people who have failed in business could be discharged from bankruptcy within 5-7 years and given the chance to strive ahead to realise their dreams, which is what Mr Wong hopes to do. Given his ability, he has no problems settling the target contribution, but what is at stake is his reputation. If our society is unable to tolerate failure, and not accepting mistakes, fears taking risks and dodges from it; if parents are unwilling to let children take risks, or are not used to the idea of letting children take risks and responsibilities, then Singapore would lack the social environment to groom entrepreneurship. Without the nurturing soil, big trees can never grow.
Allow me to share the insights from Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in his book "The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States, and the World". Mr Lee felt that the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship is even more important than technological ability. In an era of technological revolution, only talented entrepreneurs would be able to seize new opportunities, create new ideas, establish new enterprises, and make great strides forward. The ordinary businessmen only need to learn from others' experiences to have a fairly comfortable life, but those businessmen who possess the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit can reap rich rewards.
These statements show that our Founding Prime Minister values the importance of grooming the entrepreneurial spirit. However, from CDAC's survey results, parents certainly have neglected the importance of the entrepreneurial spirit. This gap makes us think hard about whether we should create a more conducive social environment for entrepreneurs. After all, failure is the mother of success. Though we can tolerate failures, we should not indulge failures. There is no conflict of interest between the Government legislation of protecting creditors' interests and grooming the entrepreneurial spirit. Successful entrepreneurs have a responsibility to their shareholders, employees and customers, and are able to gain the trust of interested parties.
In the recently concluded SEA Games, Singapore made sports history by the most number of medals won! However, as we followed the Games closely those few days, the sports we banked on for gold medals turned out to disappoint us, while those sports that were not on the radar suddenly produced many dark horses. In the future, the business environment can be expected to be full of uncertainties, just as in the SEA Games. Past glories may be overtaken by others, while past failures could also be the foundation for a comeback. Amending the Bankruptcy Act, specifying the minimum period to discharge a bankrupt, is like giving a new lease of life to those who have failed, giving them another platform to strive forward after they have learned their lessons the hard way. This is extremely good news for would-be entrepreneurs. I hope this is a signal for the whole society to view the business cycle with greater magnanimity. Hence, I support the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill.
:
Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the debate be now adjourned."
Resolved, "That the debate be now adjourned." - [Mr Gan Kim Yong].
: Resumption of debate, what day?
:
Tomorrow, Sir.
: So be it.
].
Adjourned accordingly at 6.42 pm.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs with regard to the shooting incident at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on 20 June 2015 (a) what are the safety and security protocols when the Police escorts persons-in-custody in hospitals; (b) whether these protocols are followed in this case; and (c) arising from this incident, what changes, if any, will Police make to these protocols.
: Person-in-Custody, or PIC, who requires medical attention may be escorted out of secured Police facilities to a hospital for treatment. The Police have an established set of procedures to guard against the risk of PICs escaping while in hospital. These procedures are benchmarked against international best practices. For example, Police studied the PIC management system of the Victoria Police in Australia in 2006, and the UK Police in 2009 and 2011.
First, grip restraints are applied on a PIC who is being escorted for medical treatment at hospitals. Each set of grip restraints comprises two belts. One belt is placed around the PIC’s waist, and has two wrist restraints which are used to lock the PIC’s hands in position at the sides of his waist. The other belt has two ankle restraints which are fastened around the ankles of the PIC to restrict his movement. The grip restraints have been used by the Police since 2005 and are also used by the US Department of Homeland Security, and many correctional facilities and law enforcement agencies around the world.
Unless deemed necessary by the medical staff for medical examination or treatment, grip restraints cannot be removed from the PIC at any time. Where it is necessary to release the grip restraint at one wrist, the other arm unaffected by the medical treatment must be secured to an immovable fixture.
Second, a minimum of two police escort officers are required to be present at all times during the escort of the PIC. While on escort duty, the officers are not to let the PIC out of their sight at any time. The officers must be vigilant, and exercise situational awareness to minimise any opportunities for escape.
All frontline police officers are trained to escort PICs as part of their basic training, and required to take an annual test to maintain these basic police competencies. Officers also have to be trained in the use of grip restraints before they are allowed to use them on PICs.
I will now come to this specific case. I will present the facts as are currently known, in order not to prejudice the ongoing Police investigations, and the criminal case against Muhammad Iskandar Bin Sa’at (Iskandar), the PIC involved in the incident at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on 20 June 2015.
On 19 June 2015, one day before the incident, Iskandar had been arrested for motor vehicle theft, and was ordered by the Courts to be remanded for further investigations. On 20 June 2015, he complained of chest pains and was escorted by two Police officers to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital to seek medical attention.
He was brought to one of the hospital’s designated holding rooms for PICs which is not accessible to the public, for the medical examination. While in the room, he attacked one of the Police officers and attempted to escape. The Police officer tried to prevent the PIC from doing so. A struggle ensued during which the PIC grabbed the Police officer’s revolver. Shots were fired from the officer’s revolver. The PIC sustained superficial injuries while the Police officer suffered gunshot wounds to his left thumb and right foot. The PIC was subsequently subdued and the situation brought under control.
Police’s preliminary investigations showed that the escort procedures, which were last reviewed by the Police in 2014, are generally sound. Nonetheless, in the light of this incident, the Police are doing ground audits to ensure that the escort procedures are being properly complied with.
Every escape or attempt to escape from custody is a very serious matter, as this could pose a threat to public safety. The Police’s Internal Affairs Office (IAO) is conducting a thorough investigation into possible negligence of duty by the officers involved in escorting the PIC at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. The IAO will establish the full facts of what happened and how the incident was handled.
MHA has an independent review mechanism which the Minister can convene to look into cases of significance. This ensures that Home Team Departments’ investigations into their officers’ proper performance of duties are thorough and well-conducted. Given the seriousness of the incident, I am convening an Independent Review Panel to review the findings of Police’s internal investigations. The criminal investigations into the unlawful discharge of firearms are also continuing. The findings from all these investigations will allow the Police to identify any shortcomings in compliance and also take corrective action to address gaps, if any, in the existing procedures.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the total amount spent on the ABC Waters programme since its launch in 2006; (b) what are the key benefits that have been reaped from it; (c) what has been the main impact of opening our water catchment areas to the public for recreation; (d) what is the cost of cleaning our waterways each year and what is the main debris that has been removed; and (e) how many more ABC Waters projects will there be and what is the budget allocated over the next 10 years.
: PUB launched the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters, or "ABC Waters" Programme in 2006 as a long-term initiative to transform Singapore’s utilitarian drains, canals and reservoirs into beautiful streams, rivers and lakes that are well-integrated with the surrounding parks and community spaces.
Through the Programme, stormwater runoff is detained and treated using ABC Waters design features before they reach the waterways. These features are environmentally sustainable green features integrated with the urban development. The waterways and water bodies are also enhanced aesthetically, creating new community, social and recreational spaces near water and encouraging new lifestyle activities and attractions to flourish at these spaces. As Singaporeans enjoy our waters, they will cultivate and develop a sense of shared ownership towards our water resource. The ABC Waters Programme enhances our quality of life, and brings us closer to the vision of transforming Singapore into a "City of Gardens and Water".
As of end May 2015, PUB has completed 27 ABC Waters projects across Singapore at a total cost of approximately $134 million. Under the Programme, PUB has also opened 974 ha of reservoirs and 94.6 km of waterways to the public for recreation. The Programme has been very well-received by the public. So far, more than 1,800 community events have been held at various completed ABC Waters projects. The Programme has also been successful at encouraging communities to take ownership of our waterways. Under PUB’s Friends of Water Programme, 316 community groups have adopted Singapore’s waterways, with 275 taking ownership of ABC Waters projects. These groups care for our waters by conducting clean-ups, carrying out learning trials to facilitate experiential learning about water management, and encouraging people to enjoy water responsibly.
Arising from various measures taken by PUB and stakeholders’ involvement, our waterways are cleaner than before. That said, it is unavoidable that some debris will end up in the water. Most of the debris consists of fallen leaves. To keep our waterways clean, the Department of Public Cleanliness (DPC) from NEA deploys contractors to clean public drains regularly under its integrated public cleaning contracts. About $37 million a year is allocated to the cleaning of public drains.
Looking forward, we hope to enlist the help of every Singaporean to care for our waters. PUB will continue its efforts under the ABC Waters Programme to bring people closer to water, so that they can enjoy and cherish this precious resource. PUB is looking at implementing over 100 ABC Waters projects by 2030. In addition to the 27 completed projects, 23 projects have been approved to date for implementation under the Programme. If resources permit, more projects will be carried out in future phases of the Programme. By 2030, we plan to increase the total area of reservoirs and length of waterways opened to the public to 1,039 ha and 100 km respectively.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) when will NEA announce the details of its enhanced "Rat Attack" programme; (b) what is the new subsidy quantum to be provided to Town Councils under this programme; and (c) which Town Councils have signed up for the two-year "Rat Attack" programme since 2011.
: My Ministry has been working with the Town Councils (TC) to control the rodent population in our public housing estates. To assist the TCs, my Ministry provided co-funding for the treatment of rodent burrows under the Rat Attack Programme. Fifteen TCs have come on board the programme since 2011, including Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East TC.
Our studies have shown that rodents are adapting well to our urban environment, moving beyond burrows and multiplying quickly in poorly managed bin centres and bin chutes. The TCs have also provided feedback that the Rat Attack Programme should directly target the rodent population at its source. To help the TCs reduce the rodent population more effectively, we have revised the Rat Attack Programme to shift its focus from treating rodent burrows to culling rodents in bin centres and bin chutes where their food sources are. Details of the revised programme will be announced by the end of this month.
The tackling of the rodent infestation issue requires every stakeholder to play his part. My Ministry will review the Rat Attack Programme and the enforcement regime for rodent infestation from time to time. We strongly encourage all TCs to come on board the revised Rat Attack Programme to reduce the rodent population in our public housing estates.
asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will reconsider locating the temporary campus of the new junior college that was originally planned to be located at the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio area to somewhere nearer Ang Mo Kio instead of the Mount Sinai area.
20
asked the Minister for Education (a) whether he can provide an update on the review of the location of the temporary premises of the new junior college and as to whether it will still be in the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio area and not at Mount Sinai; and (b) what are the learning points from the protracted delay of the construction of this junior college.
: In 2013, Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls School came together to start a new Integrated Programme (IP). MOE approved starting this new IP in 2013 even though the new Junior College (JC) that these students would progress to in 2017, would not have its permanent campus ready by 2017. MOE decided to proceed early so as to allow more students, starting in 2013, to benefit fully from the programme. While facilities are important, the essence of the programme lies in the innovative curriculum and teaching approach. If we had waited till all the physical facilities are ready, the students who are currently benefitting from the IP would have lost an opportunity. We thus went ahead, after informing the public in 2012 that the new JC would start operations in 2017 at an interim campus - the former ITE Bishan.
In planning for the permanent campus for the new JC, MOE had sought to secure the best possible site. This new JC would be used by many cohorts of students, for a long time to come. We needed a large enough site, ideally close to the partner secondary schools, and accessible by public transport. As the three partner secondary schools are situated in the central part of Singapore which has many competing land uses, such sites are limited.
After a careful and extensive search, we secured the site at Sin Ming Avenue as it best met the criteria. Even though the lease for its current tenant, the Asian Golf Academy, ends only in December 2015, we decided on this site as it best meets the long term needs of the new JC. With the existing tenancy, initial estimates was that the construction of the permanent site could only be completed by mid-2018. Late last year, MOE was informed that there were substantial changes to the alignment of the Cross Island Line. It would now run underneath a much larger part of the permanent site. The high-rise nature of the JC also required more pre-construction works, such as extensive soil investigation. These works can only be carried out when the current lessee vacates in December 2015. With these developments, the design of the JC campus had to be modified and construction would take longer. The permanent campus is now expected to be completed around end-2019.
We had planned for the interim campus of the new JC to be at the former ITE Bishan. This site is now holding St. Joseph’s Institution (SJI) while its Malcolm Road campus is being renovated. However, as SJI encountered difficulties and delays in its upgrading works, it will need to extend its stay till mid-2017. We therefore needed another interim site for the new JC to start operating from in 2017.
We explored various possibilities, including the former ITE Ang Mo Kio. Considering all factors, the former RJC campus at Mount Sinai is the best available interim site. It is sufficiently large and has the right complement of facilities such as lecture theatres, sporting facilities and common spaces. This site best meets the needs of the new JC’s curriculum and programmes.
At a dialogue session with parents on 25 May this year, some parents were concerned about the distance, and requested for MOE to reconsider the feasibility of the former ITE Ang Mo Kio. We did so but after weighing all the factors carefully, we have reaffirmed the Mount Sinai site as the most suitable interim campus, and have conveyed this to parents.
The Mount Sinai site is accessible to JC-age students, even if it is further from home for some students currently in the IP. It is served by several bus services and is within walking distance to Buona Vista MRT station. Raffles JC operated from Mount Sinai for 20 years (1984 to 2004) and had students from all over Singapore. Dunman High School used it as their holding site (2007 to 2008) when their campus at Tanjung Rhu underwent upgrading. In the case of Dunman High School, the students ranged from Secondary 1 to JC2. Hence, students of JC-age would not have difficulty accessing the JC, even it was further away than what was initially planned. NUS High School for Mathematics and Science also started in 2005 at Mount Sinai before moving to its permanent campus.
We will rejuvenate the Mount Sinai campus for the new JC to operate in from 2017. Further details of the refurbishment plans will be provided later this year.
MOE appreciates the concern of parents in the changes of plans and timing for the interim and permanent campus of the new JC. It is not ideal, and we regret that the developments did not allow us to proceed earlier. But, we are glad that the current cohorts of students who are affected have been able to benefit from the IP.
MOE is pleased that the three partner secondary schools have developed a strong IP over the past three years. For example, students are exposed to Eastern and Western philosophies in their World Readiness Programme. They have developed cross-cultural sensitivity and a strong sense of service to the community. Three cohorts, or around 1,200 students, have already benefited from it. These students can look forward to a rich learning experiences at Mount Sinai, as the new JC will extend these programmes into the JC years. In addition, the new JC will offer the Bicultural Studies Programme in Chinese, the Humanities Programme, the Music Elective Programme, and a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programme. These programmes aim to deepen students’ understanding of complex issues, cultivate in them good values, develop their resilience and tenacity as they grapple with challenges and difficult issues.
Students, teachers, schools and alumni of the three partner schools play an important role in building the ethos and culture of this new JC. In the coming months, we will work with key stakeholders on the name of the new JC and the composition of its School Advisory Committee. We will also engage relevant stakeholders on elements of the new JC’s identity, such as the school uniform and emblems. We hope that the new JC develops a distinctive character.
Students of the new JC will have the unique experience of being pioneers in co-creating the school’s identity, and in growing and living out their school’s values. We hope that these values can guide our students who come through this IP and the new JC to become their best, to be rugged and resilient, have a strong sense of service to the community and a regard for others.
MOE looks forward to working with school leaders, school advisory and management committees, parents and the community to pioneer this new IP and new JC. Ultimately, it is the educational programmes that define the quality of the students’ educational experience. We look forward to the support of parents.
asked the Minister for Education whether the waiver of national examination fees is extended to those undertaking these national exams (i) for second and subsequent attempts and (ii) as private candidates.
: From 2015, MOE will waive the fees for the four national examinations, namely, the PSLE, GCE "N", "O" and "A" level examinations for Singapore Citizen students in Government-funded schools. The waiver will apply as long as the student is still studying in a Government-funded school, including those who qualify to repeat their examinations as school candidates.
For Singapore Citizens taking the national examinations as private candidates, the waiver of fees will not apply.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether there is an oversupply of food and beverage outlets and whether the manpower situation will worsen given the impending growth in this sector coupled with various mega projects in the pipeline.
: The number of establishments in the Food and Beverages (F&B) sector has increased from 6,000 in 2009 to 7,000 in 2014. The total number of workers employed has also increased at an annual rate of 4.8% from December 2009 to December 2014, which is higher than the overall workforce growth rate of 3.9% over the same period. This trend is not sustainable given our labour constraints. In addition, sales volume in the F&B sector is slowing down and companies are facing greater competition. It is therefore important for the F&B sector to improve its productivity and become more manpower-efficient.
Under the Food Services Productivity Roadmap, SPRING has implemented strategies to drive sector transformation through mass adoption of productivity initiatives. These include kitchen automation, workflow redesign, centralised dishwashing, vending machine formats, grab-and-go formats and digital services. F&B enterprises can tap on SPRING’s Capability Development Grant (CDG) and Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV) to develop capabilities, improve productivity, adopt technology and innovation to reduce reliance on manpower.
asked the Minister for Transport what are the Ministry's plans to ease the traffic congestion at Jurong East in view of the recent developments in the area including the opening of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Genting Hotel Jurong.
: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has completed a series of road improvements works in Jurong East since 2011. These include the widening of Jurong Town Hall Road and Jurong East Street 11, and the construction of new roads such as Jurong Gateway Road and Gateway Drive. With the completion of the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Jurong East Street 21 will also be widened from a dual one-lane road to a dual two-lane road. To minimise localised crowding due to chartered bus pick-ups and drop-offs, and parking queues at JEM and Westgate, LTA is introducing more alighting points for buses and more information on availability of parking in the vicinity.
With the siting of Singapore’s High Speed Rail terminus at Jurong East, LTA will further improve the road network there to support the terminus and surrounding developments.
Public transport services serving Jurong East are also being improved significantly. Apart from additional trains for the North-South and East-West MRT Lines and the upgrading of the signalling system, crowding at the Jurong East station should be reduced when Downtown Line Stage 2 opens by end of this year. Jurong East will also be served by the Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line in the longer term.
asked the Minister for Transport (a) how many motorists have been booked since the implementation of closed circuit television (CCTV) to deter illegal parking on roads; (b) among the offenders, how many of them are taxi drivers; and (c) from the CCTV footage, whether it is possible to distinguish indiscriminate illegal parking from that of taxi drivers who are merely discharging their public transport duties by alighting or picking passengers at these CCTV locations without causing obstruction or creating safety problems.
: The number of illegal parking violations has fallen sharply since the introduction of CCTV enforcement in April 2014, from a monthly average of 915 per location to 131. This is less than 15% of the original number of violations, and testifies to the effectiveness of the CCTVs in deterring illegal parking. All 70 locations where the CCTVs have been installed have seen significant improvement in traffic flow and public bus operations.
About one in six illegal parking summonses was issued to taxi drivers. We adopt the same enforcement approach for taxis and other vehicle types. This means that aside from controlled areas indicated by double yellow zig-zag lines or a single white zig-zag line, where any stopping is an offence that carries demerit points, at other locations, taxis are allowed a reasonable time to stop by the roadside to pick up or alight passengers.
asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what contingency plans are in place in the event of a hacking or internal breach of Government systems taking place and information about citizens or public officers are leaked; and (b) what additional measures, budget, capabilities and systems has the Government put in place to assure citizens of the security of their data and transactions.
: It is not possible to prescribe in advance exactly what will be done in the event of a leakage of personal information from Government systems. However, certain key principles will be upheld in the handling of an incident.
Firstly, it will be our priority to ensure that citizens’ interests are not further compromised. Should the accounts of members of the public be breached, we will take immediate measures, such as suspending the accounts until users are able to reset their passwords.
Secondly, we will need to carry out a thorough investigation to understand when and how the information was leaked. It is not always possible to be 100% sure how the breach occurred, as the event might have taken place a long time ago, and essential forensic evidence lost. However, our agencies will strive to arrive at the best possible assessment, using all available information and facts. We also recognise that as more facts come to light over time, the original assessments may have to be further revised.
Thirdly, based on the findings of the investigation, our agencies will assess what sorts of additional measures need to be undertaken, in addition to the initial set of preventive measures adopted when the breach was first detected. Our agencies will work closely with relevant agencies, including the Cyber Security Agency and the Police, in managing such an incident.
The unauthorised disclosure of personal information causes immense inconvenience and distress to affected individuals. In some cases, the information, once leaked, cannot be recovered and the harm cannot be undone.
This is why the Government believes that it is important to invest significantly in the prevention of attacks or inadvertent disclosures in the first place. We have to adopt a "security-by-design" approach so that security considerations are integrated upfront when new IT systems are being developed. The Cyber Security Agency is working with relevant stakeholders to promote this concept not just in the Government sector, but across all sectors. We also need agencies to have effective real-time monitoring of their IT systems, so that if any attack occurs, they can be detected at the earliest possible opportunity.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what are the considerations for Singapore to be a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB); (b) how will Singapore contribute to the capital of AIIB; and (c) what are the risks and opportunities for Singapore companies arising from Singapore's membership in AIIB.
31
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance what is the difference between our membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and our existing membership in the Asian Development Bank given that both are multi-lateral financial institutions focused on infrastructure development in Asia.
: The scale of infrastructure needs in Asia is large, with some US$8 trillion needed by 2020. As part of the region, Singapore views the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or the AIIB, as a timely initiative that can help close this infrastructure gap.
Singapore has itself benefitted from the assistance of institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. In 1966, we joined these Banks to access additional sources of loans. While Singapore is no longer a borrowing country, we should play our part in supporting regional connectivity and growth, which will also benefit the Singapore economy.
Singapore is one of the first few countries to be involved in the establishment of the AIIB. We are working with other founding members to build up the AIIB as a first-class international financial institution, with strong governance and high standards. Singapore played an active role in hosting and co-chairing the negotiations of the AIIB Articles of Agreement here, which were concluded in May this year.
Singapore, as a global financial centre and a base for major infrastructure companies, is well placed to collaborate with the AIIB and facilitate new opportunities for businesses here. In fact, the World Bank partners many Singapore-based companies along the infrastructure value chain, and uses Singapore as a base from which to provide urban and infrastructure solutions to countries regionally and globally. With the AIIB, companies can similarly bid for infrastructure projects, or provide advisory services for project structuring, among other opportunities. While businesses have to conduct their risk assessment for deals with the AIIB, we expect that the risk would be comparable to that of partnerships with other multilateral development institutions.
The AIIB will start with a total authorised capital of US$100 billion. The Singapore Government plans to subscribe to US$250 million, or 0.25%, of the AIIB’s total authorised capital. Of this US$250 million, 20% or US$50 million is to be paid-in over five annual installments, in other words US$10 million a year. The other 80% or US$200 million of our capital subscription does not need to be paid in, except when called by the AIIB in extraordinary circumstances. This is similar to the practice in other multilateral financial institutions.
The AIIB will focus primarily on infrastructure, while the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have additional priorities such as education and health. While Singapore is not a major donor country, we have an active partnership with these international institutions to promote regional and global growth.
There is good support for the AIIB, both within and outside the region. Fifty countries signed the AIIB Articles of Agreement last month, including our regional partners among ASEAN member states and major European economies such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The AIIB Bill, tabled for first reading in Parliament today, will provide for Singapore to become a member of the AIIB.
asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether Myanmar can be compelled to remedy the human tragedy facing the Rohingya people under articles 1, 4, 39 and other relevant articles of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration (AHRD); and (b) what other kinds of diplomatic pressures can be applied on Myanmar to curb the discrimination against and alleged human trafficking of the Rohingya people pursuant to articles 13, 14, 18 and 22 of the AHRD.
33
asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs in light of recent reports linking the multiple mass graves found along the Thai-Malaysian border to human trafficking syndicates, whether ASEAN will give effect to article 13 of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration by taking collective and responsible efforts to deter cross-border human trafficking and, if so, what actions will ASEAN take.
: Mr Christopher de Souza asked two questions which I will address together. His questions contain three parts: (a) whether Myanmar can be compelled to remedy the human tragedy facing the Rohingya people under Articles 1, 4, 39 and other relevant Articles of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration (AHRD); (b) what other kinds of diplomatic pressures can be applied on Myanmar to curb the discrimination against alleged human trafficking of the Rohingya people pursuant to Articles 13, 14, 18 and 22 of the AHRD; and (c) what actions ASEAN will take to deter cross-border human trafficking, especially in light of the recently discovered mass graves along the Thai-Malaysian border. I will address both questions together as they are related to the crisis on irregular migration in the region.
The AHRD is an aspirational document. It establishes a framework for human rights cooperation in the region. It is not a document that imposes legal obligations. Nonetheless, we hope that countries will observe the spirit and letter of the AHRD and aspire towards it. But we cannot force anyone to do so.
We have to ask Myanmar, to treat its minorities in a way consistent with international norms. That is the way ASEAN approaches discussions with member states. The question also is what can be done to help the Rohingyas. The process of human trafficking involves many criminal groups and takes places across multiple countries. Resolving the matter requires the cooperation of all countries concerned – whether they are source, transit, or destination countries. Therefore, while we urge the Myanmar government to be mindful of the plight of all people within its borders, other countries in which these traffickers operate also need to take action against such criminal syndicates.
The international community must come together. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have met to find ways to tackle the problem. ASEAN has also been coordinating an intergovernmental approach. A Convention and an ASEAN Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons were adopted at the 15th ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime (held in Siem Reap, Cambodia from 7 to 12 June 2015). ASEAN has also explored measures to help Indonesia and Malaysia – countries providing temporary shelter to the migrants – to cope with the challenges. The recent Emergency ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime in Kuala Lumpur on 2 July supported Singapore’s proposal for ASEAN to establish a trust fund. The ASEAN Secretariat will administer this trust fund comprising voluntary financial contributions from ASEAN Member States and members of the international community to support relief efforts. Singapore has committed US$200,000 to this ASEAN trust fund. ASEAN is also considering setting up a Task Force to respond to crisis and emergency situations arising from the irregular movement of persons. Beyond ASEAN, there is a need to involve wider forums. For example, the Bali Process, which is a regional Ministerial-level conference involving ASEAN and non-ASEAN countries. We will continue to encourage all countries involved to work together towards resolving this issue.
asked the Minister for Law (a) whether the debt collection process of licensed moneylenders is regulated; (b) whether any licensed moneylenders have been taken to task in the last five years for using intimidation during their debt collection; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider strengthening the framework for regulating licensed moneylenders so as to prevent intimidation of debtors.
: As I explained in an earlier response to a similar question, there are existing laws protecting debtors from unreasonable or illegal conduct by creditors, including licensed moneylenders, or their debt collectors in collecting debts. For example, they may be liable to criminal sanctions under the Penal Code if hurt or threatening behaviour is involved. The Protection from Harassment Act 2014 ("the Act") also provides for criminal sanctions and civil remedies against harassing behaviour. Some debtors have obtained court orders against harassing debt collectors under the Act.
Borrowers who encounter criminal behaviour from licensed moneylenders or their debt collectors should report the matter to the Police or the Registry of Moneylenders. Moneylenders found to have committed criminal offences during the debt collection process may have their licences suspended, not renewed or revoked by the Registry. There have been no such cases thus far.
The present system provides sufficient safeguards to protect borrowers from being intimidated by licensed moneylenders or their debt collectors. The Ministry of Law remains committed to improving the professionalism of the moneylending industry. In this regard, an Advisory Committee on Moneylending recently announced a set of 15 recommendations to strengthen the moneylending regime. The Ministry has accepted 12 recommendations, including those relating to controls on borrowing costs and borrowing quantum.
asked the Minister for Law whether the Ministry will consider subsidising or waiving the cost of executing a Writ of Seizure and Sale at the State Courts for low-income Singaporeans and those earning below $1,500 who seek to recover unpaid salaries from errant employers.
: A Writ of Seizure and Sale is needed before a party can seize and sell his debtor’s movable property, to satisfy the judgment debt against him and the costs of executing the writ. The costs of executing a Writ of Seizure and Sale are to be paid by the judgment debtor unless the Court orders otherwise. There are existing avenues for obtaining a waiver or deferment of the costs associated with executing a Writ of Seizure and Sale at the State Courts.
Any party can apply to the registrar of the State Courts to waive or defer the payment of fees or deposits that are payable to the court. The court does not charge any fees for applying for such a waiver. The registrar of the State Courts will consider all the facts of the specific situation when exercising the discretion to waive or defer the payment of such fees, including the litigant’s financial abilities or circumstances.
In addition, the Legal Aid Bureau may provide legal aid in relation to the execution of a Writ and Seizure and Sale, including that arising from an employment or labour dispute. Legal aid would be granted if the applicant satisfies the requisite tests based on means and merits. A person who receives legal aid is not liable for fees or deposits that are payable to the court.
asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth in light of the crowd control problems at the recent SEA Games Closing Ceremony (a) whether there are standard procedures for crowd management, safety and security measures at the Sports Hub which all organisers have to adhere to and implement; and (b) if so, what measures does the Ministry have in place for checks and enforcement.
: Sports Hub Pte Ltd (SHPL) has Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on crowd management, safety and security, which they require all event organisers to comply with. In addition, for every event, SHPL also works with the event organiser to tailor a specific plan that covers details such as the number of ushers and security personnel needed, and where and how to deploy them. For large events, SHPL consults and works jointly with the Singapore Police Force, Traffic Police, Land Transport Authority and Sport Singapore to review and coordinate the event plans as well as the crowd management, safety and security measures. This enables Sport Singapore to maintain oversight of risk mitigation measures.
As the Sports Hub is a relatively new venue, SHPL continues to refine its SOPs based on lessons learnt with inputs from the authorities after every event. Where relevant, Sport Singapore participates in the after action reviews and discusses operational improvements with SHPL at their regular meetings. We have collectively learnt useful lessons from the crowd control problems encountered during the SEA Games Closing Ceremony, such as the need to better advise guests about arrival timings; to cater extra time to pass through heightened security checks; and to better manage crowd build up and the ushering of people to their seats. Sport Singapore is working closely with SHPL to strengthen its SOPs and share the lessons learned with organisers of future events at the Sports Hub.
asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether there is a common pool of deputies from which deputies can be appointed for persons deemed to have lost their mental capacity but who have no kin to rely on; (b) if so, how many are currently available and how can the application be made; and (c) if not, whether the Ministry will consider setting up such a pool.
: The Ministry recognises that there are persons who have lost their mental capacity and who do not have family members to serve as their proxy decision makers. To address this need, MSF started a pilot programme in late 2014, where we put in place a panel of volunteers who could apply to the Court to be appointed as deputies who could make decisions on behalf of these individuals.
To-date, 16 public-spirited professionals have stepped forward to be part of this panel. They come from a range of professions – healthcare, legal, financial and social work. MSF will assess the efficacy of the pilot programme before refining it for wider implementation.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Government can provide a Gini coefficient trend line on income distribution for the past five years that includes the foreign population living and working in Singapore; and (b) how this Gini coefficient compares with other major cities like New York, London and Hong Kong which incorporate these segments of their populations in their Gini calculations.
: The Gini coefficient compiled annually by the Department of Statistics (DOS) covers the income from work of resident households with at least one working person. A resident household refers to a household headed by a Singapore citizen or permanent resident. The income from work of foreigners in Singapore, excluding domestic helpers, would be included in the compilation of household income for the computation of the Gini coefficient if they are members of a resident household.
DOS is unable to provide a Gini coefficient that incorporates the income from work of the entire foreign population in Singapore as data on foreigners who are not members of resident households are not available.
Due to different household and income coverage, Gini coefficients are not strictly comparable across cities. Singapore’s Gini coefficient is based on income from work of resident households with at least one working person. On the other hand, the Gini coefficients for New York City and Hong Kong cover all households, and include income from both work and non-work sources. The UK Office for National Statistics does not publish the Gini coefficient for London.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry supplements its assessment of the productivity performance of the food and accommodation services sector by using alternative measures such as the change in the number of customers served by an establishment per worker.
: The National Productivity Council (NPC) tracks Value-Added (VA) per worker at the macro-level. This is the most consistent and internationally recognised measure of productivity improvements. The NPC also supplements this measure with sector-specific indicators which better reflect the nature of each sector’s business cycles and help to enrich our understanding of the progress of our productivity initiatives.
In the Hotels and Food Services sectors, there have been steady improvements in the sector-specific indicators between 2009 and 2013. For example, revenue per worker in the Hotels sector grew 9% per annum, and revenue per worker and revenue per square foot in the Food Services sector grew 4.3% and 6.7% per annum respectively.
This suggests that mindsets towards productivity have changed and companies are taking steps to raise space productivity. In this regard, the Government will continue to assist companies, including those in the Hotels and Food Services, to innovate and boost their topline.
The NPC will continue to track VA per worker and sector-specific outcome indicators closely to monitor the progress of our productivity drive at the macro- and sector-levels. We will also continue to expand the range of sectors for which such indicators are tracked where feasible and consider publishing them at appropriate platforms in future.
asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider increasing the annual cap for the Caregiver Training Grant for each care recipient.
: The Caregivers Training Grant was introduced in 2007 to support caregivers of seniors and those with disability with up to $200 each year to attend caregiver training courses.
We do not have plans to increase the annual cap for the grant at the moment, as the current grant quantum is generally adequate. Today, about 80% of all approved caregiver training courses cost $200 or less. Over the last four years, the average annual utilisation of the grant was about $160 per caregiver.
In the last two years, we have further refined the training framework and worked with training providers to raise the quality of the courses offered.
The grant now benefits more than 6,000 caregivers annually. More than 26,000 caregivers have benefited from this grant to date.
We will however continue to monitor the utilisation and adequacy of the Caregivers Training Grant.
asked the Minister for Health whether there are attempts by the Ministry to reduce the long continuous working hours for housemen on night shifts and, if so, what are the measures considered.
: From May 2014, all house officers came under a national framework for training and assessment renamed the Postgraduate Year 1 (PGY1) training. For the PGY1 year, the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) stipulates that work should not exceed 80 hours per week, including night call hours. However, the SMC also stipulates at least four night calls per month for PGY1 doctors to learn how to manage acute conditions, under supervision, with the medical team at night. In addition, there should be at least 10 hours of rest between duty periods and an off day each week.
PGY1 doctors cannot be scheduled for more than 24 hours of continuous active duty managing patients. For those who have completed a 24-hour duty period duty period, their hand-overs to colleagues or other activities (for example, educational activities) should not take more than an additional six hours. Hospitals generally comply with these guidelines.
With regard to the frequency and duration of night calls, some hospitals have started to implement a shift system thereby reducing long working hours in clinical departments where such work patterns are suitable. For example the half call is an extension of another five to six hours to the 8-hour day and the night float is a 10-hour overlapping night shift together with this. This avoids the more tiring 24-hour continuous duty type call. These overlapping shifts together with the steady increase in the number of house officers over the years have lessened the work hours and frequency of night calls.
asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Government will consider creating more job opportunities for PMETs through place-and-train programmes that facilitate mid-career switches, which may be particularly helpful to those affected by industry restructuring.
: Our economy is restructuring towards one where growth is driven by innovation and skills. As businesses restructure, mature PMEs may be more vulnerable to being retrenched and face greater difficulties in securing their next jobs. We understand the challenges that they face. The Government has put in place various measures to help them re-skill and find new jobs. One of these measures is the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP), which enables PMEs, including those who have been made redundant, to undergo skills conversion and take on new jobs in a different industry. More than 6,000 PMEs have benefitted from the programme since its launch in 2007.
We are committed to doing more to further enhance employment and career opportunities for PMEs. As announced on 8 July 2015, the new Career Support Programme (CSP) will provide mature Singaporean PMEs greater opportunities to access mid-level and above jobs. Starting from 1 October 2015, employers who employ mature PMEs, who have been looking for jobs for at least six months, in mid-level jobs that pay at least $4,000, will be given wage support. The Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) will also collaborate with and provide incentives to private search and placement firms to help this group of PMEs access more job opportunities.
Both employers and Singaporean PMEs have important roles to play. Employers should tap on the wealth of experience of mature PMEs and consider them fairly for career opportunities. Singaporean PMEs need to be adaptable in the fast-changing economy and take ownership of their own career development, up-skilling and upgrading to take on quality jobs and careers.
asked the Minister for Manpower from 2011 to 2014, what is the number of employers found to have paid CPF contributions for local phantom workers so as to inflate their foreign worker quota.
: It is against the law for employers to inflate their foreign worker quota and employ more foreign workers than they are rightfully allowed to. From 2011 to 2014, MOM took enforcement action against 90 such employers. They inflated their foreign worker quota by making CPF contributions to locals who were not working for their companies to hire additional foreign workers.
MOM takes a serious view on employers who falsely inflate their foreign worker quota. Errant employers face a financial penalty of up to $20,000 for every work pass application made using the inflated quota. They may also be debarred from hiring foreign workers for a period of 12 months or more, depending on the severity of the case.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry monitors new developments or changes to the surrounding land use plan for recently sold or completed BTO flats whose sale value had taken into account the previous land use plans; (b) what added measures does the Ministry have in place to inform and address the concerns of nearby flat owners or those waiting for the completion of their flats of such changes in land use; and (c) whether any public consultations are conducted in advance with these flat owners, especially if the changed land use has a negative impact on the future valuation of their flats.
: Land use is strictly governed by the Master Plan which is a public document. To help potential flat buyers make an informed decision regarding their flat purchase, HDB’s sales brochures provide information on the proposed surrounding land uses and facilities, based on the prevailing Master Plan at the time of sale.
The Master Plan is subject to regular reviews. In reviewing any proposed changes to land uses stipulated in the Master Plan, URA considers the compatibility of the changes with the existing surrounding land uses and developments. These considerations are particularly pertinent in the case of residential areas such as public housing estates.
Before amending the Master Plan, URA publishes a notice of the proposed amendments to the Master Plan in the local newspapers, Government e-Gazette website and URA’s website for public inspection. This process allows members of the public, including existing and future flat owners, the opportunity to be informed of proposed changes to land uses and provide feedback on them.
The agency initiating the land use changes will also inform the Member of Parliament and constituency advisors of the development proposed on site before its implementation. This process allows MPs and Advisors to manage any queries or concerns from the local community about the proposed development.
asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider removing the income eligibility criteria for married couples who purchase a HDB resale flat close to their parents so as to allow more of such couples to qualify for the CPF Housing Grant for Families.
: First-timer families buying a resale flat to live with or near their parents or married child are eligible for the Higher-Tier CPF Housing Grant for Family of $40,000. The income ceiling of $10,000 is in place to ensure that housing subsidies are given to those who need more help. A higher income ceiling of $15,000 is set for extended families who buy a flat to live together. For families whose incomes have exceeded the limit but are in need of subsidised housing, we exercise flexibility and help them on a case-by-case basis.
As income levels have risen, we are reviewing the current income ceiling. But we are mindful that we must always give priority to those who need help most.
asked the Minister for Transport what other noise mitigation measures besides the installation of noise barriers are being considered for residential areas in Bukit Batok that are located close to MRT tracks.
49
asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry is aware of the high noise level along Khatib station's MRT track, especially in the early morning and at night; (b) whether Khatib MRT station is among the locations to have noise barriers installed; and (c) what are the interim measures to mitigate the noise levels of trains running close to residential units.
: The noise levels from train operations are generally consistent throughout the day. The perception of high noise levels in early morning and at night may be due to the low ambient noise during these times. We try to minimise such noise by ensuring that the operator maintains train wheels and tracks well. Where train noise goes above a certain level, we will consider installing noise barriers.
In addition to the 14 km of noise barriers that LTA is building in Phase 1, another 9 km of noise barriers will be built starting from 2016 in Phase 2. We will consider the Members’ requests for Khatib and Bukit Batok. We will announce more details of Phase 2 by the end of this year.
asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there will be plans to install noise barriers along roads and traffic junctions; and (b) whether the Ministry is aware of high noise levels experienced by residents at The Estuary condominium.
: It is not practical to install noise barriers along roads and traffic junctions. Gaps will be needed in the noise barriers for bus stops, and for vehicular and pedestrian access. These gaps would render noise barriers ineffective. Pedestrian safety would also be compromised as their view of on-coming traffic could be blocked.
The Estuary meets the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s setback guideline of 15 metres from the road. However, in response to residents’ feedback on excessive road noise, the National Parks Board has planted more trees along the road fronting the condominium. The Land Transport Authority and other agencies will continue to engage the condominium management on other mitigating measures, including for them to install structures to absorb or deflect the noise.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance how can the Government as a service buyer support service providers that are engaged by Ministries and statutory boards to adopt the NWC recommendations for outsourced workers earning a basic salary of $1,100 and below to get the monthly $60 built-in wage increase.
: Since July 2013, MOF has required Government agencies to remind bidders for Government contracts, particularly those involving security, cleaning and landscaping services, that they should adhere to National Wage Council (NWC) recommendations on wage increments and factor it into their bid prices.
For multi-year contracts, bidders may also present a year-by-year break-down of their bid price, to reflect wage increments over the contract duration. This clearly signals the Government's interest to ensure that bidders have realistic projections of their wage costs and willingness to pay contract prices that support good labour management practices. New multi-year tenders called by Government agencies since then provide for such year-on-year break-down.
asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) how the National Arts Council (NAC) mitigates the costs placed on NAC grant recipients who have already spent grant monies carrying out their approved projects and who subsequently have their grant support retracted; (b) whether such grant recipients should be discharged from any requirements to return granted funds that have already been approved; and (c) what measures does the NAC take to ensure that the grant consideration and approval process is kept non-partisan and objective.
: As a public agency disbursing public funds, NAC is guided by Government policies that safeguard national interests. Its funding guidelines are made public on the NAC’s website and are made clear in the grant funding agreement signed between NAC and grant recipients.
NAC reserves the right to withdraw the grant if the project does not fulfil the funding agreement or contravenes the funding guidelines. Withdrawing grants rarely happens as most parties abide by the agreements they have made. However, if there is a breach of the funding agreement, as a public institution, NAC has the responsibility to recover any public monies that have been disbursed.
Beyond grants for specific projects, NAC’s support includes arts housing, professional development, market and audience development as well as philanthropy for the arts. Hence, while NAC may have withdrawn a grant for a specific project, the artist or arts group may still receive NAC’s support in other areas. This can cushion the impact of the grant withdrawal on the artist or arts group.
To ensure impartiality, NAC’s grant assessments are made in consultation with views from external assessors such as industry advisors, experts and practitioners, and based on published grant evaluation criteria such as artistic merit, extent of public engagement as well as the capacity and commitment of the applicant to execute the project successfully.
asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth how the National Arts Council works with other bodies to determine whether an artistic work undermines the legitimacy of public institutions or threatens national security or stability.
: In assessing whether an artistic work contravenes funding guidelines because it undermines the authority or legitimacy of the government and public institutions, or threatens the nation’s security or stability, the National Arts Council (NAC) will consult relevant agencies such as the Media Development Authority (MDA) and Ministry of Home Affairs. For instance, NAC would typically consult MDA on their views and classification rating of an art work. NAC would also communicate closely with the grant applicant to fully understand the context of their project. As the overall arts funding body, NAC will then make the final decision, taking into account the inputs received.
asked the Minister for Social and Family Development what is the current waiting time for children and youths with disabilities such as speech disabilities, dyslexia and autism to get their assessments carried out, both in the public/Government as well as private sectors.
: Under the Child Development Programme, paediatricians at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and National University Hospital (NUH) provide diagnosis and assessment for children aged six years and below who are referred for developmental problems. The median wait time in 2014 for an initial assessment by a doctor for subsidised patients was 18 days at KKH and 40 days at NUH.
Children identified with developmental delays will be referred to the MSF-funded programmes for therapy and learning services, depending on the severity of their conditions. Those with milder developmental delays are assisted through a programme called the Development Support Programme offered in 300 mainstream preschools. These children typically receive intervention services within three to four weeks of being identified. Those at risk of moderate to severe disabilities can receive early intervention services at 17 MSF-funded centres operated by Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs). In 2014, the average time taken for referral, assessment for placement and eventual enrolment was about five months.
With greater awareness and earlier diagnosis, there is growing demand for early intervention services for young children. MSF will continue to develop a continuum of early intervention services and expand their capacity to meet the different needs of these children in a timely manner.
For children above the age of six, KKH and NUH provide diagnostic services for a range of developmental disabilities such as Autism and speech and language delays, while Institute of Mental Health (IMH) provides assessment for Autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In 2014, the average waiting time for subsidised patients was between one week to two months.
Students in our mainstream schools can also be referred for assessment and diagnosis conducted by MOE psychologists. Such referrals are prioritised jointly between the school and the MOE psychologist based on the urgency and severity of the child’s needs. Waiting time for diagnosis therefore vary.
Students with disabilities who are of school-going age can receive assistance for their education through their Special Education (SPED) schools or at their mainstream schools.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how often are air quality readings taken at industrial estates that are close to residential areas such as that of Sungei Kadut; (b) how many factories in Sungei Kadut have been fined for breaching the standards in the last five years; and (c) whether the Ministry has any plans to increase environmental surveillance and enforcement in these industrial estates.
: Air quality readings are monitored continuously by the National Environment Agency (NEA) through a network of 22 stations across Singapore. Four of these are located near industrial estates that are close to residential estates, including one near the industrial estates at Sungei Kadut. Factories must ensure that their operations comply with the requirements under the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA) and its Regulations. Industries that are known to have processes with higher air pollutant loads are required to engage an accredited surveyor to conduct source emission testing and submit the test report to NEA each year. NEA also conducts scheduled and random factory inspections. Over the past five years, seven factories in the Sungei Kadut area have been fined for not meeting NEA’s emissions standards or not maintaining their pollution control equipment properly. We welcome all feedback and members of the public who wish to report sightings of smoky stacks can do so via the NEA hotline or myENV app.
To improve air quality and safeguard public health, my Ministry has recently tightened industrial emissions standards for a range of air pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and carbon monoxide. With effect from 1 July 2015, new industrial plants have to comply with these new standards while existing plants are expected to comply within three to eight years for the range of pollutants.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the prospect of Singapore being hit by a major earth tremor; (b) whether any scientific study has been carried out to find out the chances of Singapore being hit by a major tremor; and (c) what is the likely impact of a major volcanic eruption in neighbouring countries on Singapore.
: The likelihood of a major earthquake occurring in Singapore is extremely low. Most earthquakes tend to occur at the active margins of tectonic plates, such as in Sumatra, Java, the Philippines, Japan, New Zealand and South America. Singapore is situated about 400 km from the nearest plate margin. The crust underlying Singapore is considered stable by experts in geology, and the records from our seismic stations and global positioning instruments show no evidence of active faults within Singapore.
Despite this, Singapore can be affected by tremors from distant large earthquakes. Some high-rise buildings may sway as a result of such tremors. However, few events release enough seismic energy for tremors to be felt here, and even then much of the energy is lost by the time it reaches Singapore. Hence, such tremors are unlikely to be significant enough to cause structural damage to our buildings. Buildings in Singapore are designed to established building codes and are therefore sufficiently robust to resist the tremors arising from distant earthquakes. For example, tremors were felt in Singapore in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009; and there was no structural damage to our buildings.
Singapore is a few hundred kilometres away from the nearest volcano, but if an eruption is sufficiently large and winds are unfavourable, it could result in fine windborne ash reaching Singapore. The possible downstream consequences are that air transport, air quality, water quality and cleanliness of open areas could be affected by suspended ash and ashfall.
Where air quality is concerned, the approach we take is to monitor and prepare for such episodes as we do for transboundary haze. NEA also provides relevant information for the public on its website. As for other possible impacts such as on aviation, there are plans in place to coordinate a quick response and mitigate the impact of such volcanic ash.
The severity and duration of a volcanic eruption would vary. The last documented case was the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in Luzon Island, Philippines in June 1991. Following the eruption on 14 June 1991, air quality in Singapore went into the moderate or unhealthy range for three days. (Based on the new PSI scale with 24-hour PM2.5 included, the readings were 91, 112 and 91 for 17, 18 and 19 June respectively.) No other adverse effects were reported.
asked the Minister for Education (a) in 2014, how many foreign students have received the Ministry's tuition grants and are bonded to work in Singapore; (b) from 2011 to 2014, what is the breakdown of foreign students who are not able to find jobs six months after their graduation, according to their faculties; and (c) whether these foreign students have the option to continue to stay in or leave Singapore.
: In 2014, around 3,650 international students in the 2014 matriculation cohort in the polytechnics and autonomous universities received the tuition grant. Upon graduation, international students work in Singapore to supplement our labour force.
Faculty-level employment information for international students is not readily available. However, on average, eight in ten international students who received tuition grant in our polytechnics and autonomous universities are either working in Singapore after graduation, or have been granted approval by MOE to defer their service obligation to pursue further studies. For the remaining international students, some are in the midst of seeking deferment approval, and some are still seeking employment.
For those who face difficulty in finding employment and need guidance, they can approach the career centre or alumni office in the institutions for career guidance. The career office or alumni office provides guidance to their students and graduates on career preparation and job search, job opportunities advertised through the institutions, and other related employment resources. This service is available to all students and graduates from the respective institutions.
International students who have received the tuition grant and are seeking employment in Singapore after graduation can apply for a one-year Long-Term Visit Pass with the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority.
asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current estimated number of freelance workers in Singapore; (b) whether there is an increasing trend of such workers here; and (c) if the Ministry will consider including freelance workers in the Employment Act or other relevant Acts for greater clarity of the recourse available to them should they be denied payment by hirers for services rendered.
: As of June 2014, there were 183,900 freelance workers, forming 8.7% of employed residents compared to 9.4% 10 years ago in 2004.
Freelance workers are persons who operate their own business or trade. This means that they are their own employers. They decide which service contracts to enter into. There is no employer-employee relationship between them and their clients. For this reason, they are not covered by the Employment Act (EA).
Freelance workers who are not paid by their clients can seek legal redress by commencing proceedings against their clients at the State Courts, which includes the Small Claims Tribunal, depending on the nature of the claim or disputed amount.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current availability of unsold executive condominiums (ECs); (b) whether the Ministry will consider raising the income ceiling for first-time buyers who are newly-weds to help this sandwiched group of buyers for ECs; and (c) what is the average waiting time for new applicants of ECs.
: About 2,230 Executive Condominium (EC) units are currently unsold. EC applicants have to wait about three years on average, from the time of the sales launch to the issuance of the Temporary Occupation Permit.
We last raised the income ceiling for ECs in 2011 from $10,000 to $12,000. We are in the process of reviewing the income ceiling.
asked the Minister for National Development what is the rationale of having more than 50% of the total 41,600 heavy vehicle parking lots managed by private operators.
: There are about 44,000 heavy vehicle parking lots for 35,000 heavy vehicles. Businesses use these heavy vehicles to transport goods, machinery and people. That is why most of the parking lots are found in industrial estates at premises where businesses operate. Naturally, these parking spaces are managed by the private sector.
asked the Minister for Transport (a) what measures can the Ministry embark on to mitigate the excessive noise generated by low-flying commercial and military aircraft and helicopters near Seletar Airport which happens daily in both day and night; and (b) whether another noise impact study can be done this year.
: Aircraft arriving and departing Seletar Airport follow flight paths designed to minimise the noise impact on surrounding residential estates such as Yishun and Yio Chu Kang. Whenever the wind conditions permit, CAAS will direct aircraft to land from, and take off towards the north, in which case the aircraft would not fly over any residential estates. However, there are instances whereby aircraft have to land from or take off towards the south due to the direction and speed of the wind. This could result in some noise to residents living along the flight path.
CAAS has put in place various noise abatement measures. For example, aircraft are required to fly at an altitude of at least 1,500 feet (about 450 metres) over residential areas around Seletar Airport to reduce the noise impact on the ground. Training flights and cargo flights are prohibited from operating at Seletar Airport between 10 pm and 7 am daily.
CAAS and the operator of Seletar Airport (Changi Airport Group) regularly review the extent of aircraft noise around Seletar Airport, and assess if the measures to mitigate noise are sufficient. The most recent study was concluded in November 2014. The study found that current and future anticipated noise levels over residential areas around Seletar Airport are within the noise parameters of land-use planning guidelines for residential developments around the airport.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Government will take the lead to ensure that existing and future unarmed security contracts entered into by Ministries and statutory boards will adopt the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) recommended by the Security Tripartite Cluster before PWM becomes a licensing condition on 1 September 2016.
: The Government has accepted the Security Tripartite Cluster’s recommendations for the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) to be introduced to the security industry, and fully supports implementing the PWM in public sector security contracts, even before PWM becomes a licensing condition on 1 September 2016.
We have started discussions with our Tripartite partners on ways to identify early adopters of PWM in the security sector, and to give them due recognition when awarding contracts.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs whether the SCDF can dedicate an ambulance on a standby basis for Jurong Island.
: At any one time, SCDF deploys a fleet of 50 emergency ambulances across Singapore to ensure prompt response to emergency medical calls. SCDF considers demand factors like population density and case load when deciding on its deployment strategy. In 2014, SCDF responded to more than 155,000 ambulance calls, or about 427 calls per day. Of these, 73 calls over the whole year, or one call every five days, were from Jurong Island.
Given this case load, it is not practical for the SCDF to assign one ambulance to standby just for Jurong Island. However to ensure swift response to emergency medical calls on Jurong Island, an emergency ambulance is deployed at the Jurong Pier Fire Post, located at the Jurong Island Checkpoint, from 7 am to 11 pm daily. This covers the period when industrial activity on Jurong Island is the busiest. However for optimal use of our limited ambulance resources, this ambulance is also dispatched to emergency medical cases in the vicinity, such as Boon Lay, Tuas and Jurong Industrial Estate.
SCDF’s deployment of its emergency ambulance fleet is not static. SCDF closely monitors the population changes, its response times and adjusts the deployment of its emergency ambulances as necessary to ensure prompt and effective response.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs how does the Ministry ensure that homes in residential estates remain accessible to larger emergency vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances, especially homes situated on narrow roads that allow kerbside parking of vehicles.
70
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether there is detailed area-based planning by SCDF to ensure that large emergency vehicles like fire engines and ambulances can gain physical access and egress when responding to emergencies in residential estates where roads may be narrow and not passable to large vehicles; and (b) whether SCDF emergency vehicles have encountered access difficulties in responding to calls in residential estates due to physical constraints such as narrow roads or obstruction from parked vehicles and, if so, what protocols exist to guide officers on overcoming these difficulties and to facilitate working with stakeholders to prevent a recurrence.
: Mdm Speaker, with your permission, I will address Ms Sylvia Lim’s two questions on emergency vehicles road access together.
Public roads in Singapore are designed according to strict standards to ensure that there is a minimum clearance for emergency vehicles to pass through. This minimum clearance requirement also applies to narrow roads, including those that allow kerbside vehicular parking, so that homes adjacent to such roads remain accessible to all emergency vehicles. The SCDF maintains a fleet of smaller, more maneuverable emergency vehicles such as the Light Fire Attack Vehicle, Class 3 Emergency Ambulances and Fire Bikes which could be deployed with ease on roads with narrow access ways.
The SCDF also conducts regular ground surveys to familiarise SCDF responders with the specific operational challenges of the geographical area covered by each fire station. As part of these surveys, the SCDF identifies areas with rampant illegal parking which could potentially impact its emergency vehicle access. The SCDF will notify LTA who will then undertake regular enforcement action against the illegally-parked vehicles in these areas to ensure that the access of emergency vehicles is not impeded. Errant vehicle owners may be fined or awarded demerit points to deter recurrent offences.
When there is obstruction of access in an emergency situation, the SCDF ground commander will assess the ground situation and consider alternative options to overcome the obstruction. The options include the deployment of the Light Fire Attack Vehicle and the Fire Bikes, which are dispatched together with the larger fire engines for emergencies in residential estates. The ground commander can also deploy fire-fighting equipment and SCDF officers on foot to the scene to support the smaller emergency vehicles which are already at scene. This will be done concurrently while the SCDF officers engage the building management or residents to remove the obstructing vehicles. The Fire Safety Act also empowers SCDF officers to forcibly remove any vehicle that is impeding its fire-fighting operation.
asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the principles behind the decision on whether to provide for single working mothers the same 16 weeks of paid maternity leave as accorded to married working mothers; and (b) how does the policy balance the principle of equalisation of opportunities for all Singaporean children with the principle of supporting the social value of parenthood within the context of marriage.
: There are three objectives that guide our approach towards providing benefits and incentives to children and parents. We seek a balance among these objectives.
First, we are committed to providing all children with equal opportunities to fulfil their potential. For this reason, we extend education and healthcare benefits to all Singaporean children, regardless of the marital status of their parents.
Second, we want to continue to promote parenthood within marriage. This is the desired and prevailing societal norm in Singapore. So we have some benefits to incentivise births within marriages, and these are available only to married parents.
Third, we recognise that some families, including some single parents and their children, face greater challenges. We have support programmes to help these vulnerable families.
However, I fully understand that some single unwed working mothers require greater social support. This help encompasses education, healthcare, work and financial support. The support provided and needed clearly goes beyond maternity leave and some of these differences in benefits. Help is provided on many fronts in order to support the mother and child. Single mothers may approach any Family Service Centre or Social Service Office and we will follow up. Single expectant mothers are also supported through programmes in the community that provide hotlines, counselling and residential services. The Government will continue to work with the community to support single unwed parents and their children.
I recognise that there are some areas of difference in terms of what single unwed mothers receive as compared to married mothers. This is not cast in stone. I am sympathetic to the challenges faced by single unwed parents. I am reviewing some of these and will make adjustments, where possible.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what are the considerations when the Ministry looks into the installation of CCTVs to identify high-rise litterers.
: High-rise littering is an anti-social and serious offence that poses both hygiene problems and safety hazards to the public. NEA enforcement officers received about 2,500 cases of feedback on high-rise littering in 2014. In most cases, the situation improved following outreach and education efforts by my Ministry, the Town Councils and grassroots organisations.
In areas with persistent high-rise littering despite outreach and education efforts, surveillance cameras will be deployed to catch irresponsible high-rise litterbugs in the act. In 2014 alone, my Ministry took more than 800 enforcement actions against persons caught for high-rise littering.
asked the Minister for Education (a) since 2012, what percentage of international students on scholarships awarded by the Ministry have graduated with second class upper honours or better; (b) how does this figure compare with the 97% of Public Service Commission scholars who graduate each year with second class upper honours or better; and (c) whether the Ministry intends to set a base score of a second upper honours or its equivalent which international scholars must attain to maintain their scholarships at each renewal review.
: Since 2012, about 68% of international students on undergraduate scholarships have graduated with second upper class honours or better. This is comparable to the performance of Singaporean scholarship holders studying at the local universities. It is also higher than the overall percentage of students graduating with second upper class honours or better, which is about 38%.
Mr Yee asked how these figures compare with that of PSC scholars. There is no good basis for comparing as the number of PSC scholars is extremely small and they undertake their studies in a variety of top-tier universities, both local and overseas.
The basic grade that the international scholars have to meet in order to maintain their scholarships is a cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.5 out of 5 for NUS, NTU and SUTD, and 3.4 out of four for SMU. This is commensurate with what is required of Singaporean scholarship holders studying at these universities. These criteria strike a careful balance between encouraging students to achieve certain standards in academic work, while giving them the time and space to learn deeply and widely through a variety of activities
asked the Minister for National Development among the HDB flat owners who have fully paid up their HDB loan for their first flat, in the last 10 years (a) how many did not sell the flat upon full settlement of the loan; and (b) how many have sold the flat and upgraded to a larger flat or private property before reaching the ages of 40, 45, 50 and 55 respectively, and what is the percentage of such owners relative to the total number of HDB flat owners.
: Between 2005 and 2014, 59,100 first-time HDB flat owners fully paid up their HDB loans. Among them, about 50,000 (85%) continued to own their flats.
Another 5% sold their flat and moved to a larger flat or private property before the age of 55. 1,100 did so before the age of 40, 800 between 40 and 44, 500 between 45 and 49, and 200 between 50 and 54.
asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether third-party taxi booking service providers will be required to engage only private car drivers or taxi drivers who are screened, trained, and tested under the same vocational licence regime administered by LTA; (b) how will the Ministry harmonise taxi call booking QoS standards imposed on the taxi companies when their taxi drivers are also taking third-party taxi bookings; and (c) apart from the statutory costs, whether the Ministry will apply the governing terms and conditions of registering and deregistering taxis to private hire vehicles.
: Mdm Speaker, the Third-Party Taxi Booking Service Providers Act, passed earlier this May, requires service providers to dispatch only licensed taxis and taxi drivers in response to a taxi booking. The Act also allows the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to collect trip data from these providers, which LTA will take into account when assessing the taxi companies’ call booking Quality of Service performance.
There are no plans to apply the same regulations and concessions for taxis to private hire vehicles. LTA is, however, studying measures to enhance commuter safety when taking such services.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the Ministry's assessment of the amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act made in 2012 in the gathering of information and intelligence against the masterminds behind the drug trafficking syndicates; and (b) how effective has it been in disrupting their drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore.
: The amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act in 2012 on the application of the death penalty to the offence of drug trafficking gave the court the discretion to decide whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment and caning, or the death sentence for drug couriers who have provided substantive assistance to the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. The “substantive assistance” condition is meant to enhance the operational effectiveness of the CNB in taking action against drug syndicates. It enables CNB investigations to reach higher into the hierarchy of such syndicates.
Since the changes were implemented, the information provided by drug couriers and joint collaboration with regional counterparts have led to the arrest of more than 40 drug traffickers and disrupted the operations of drug trafficking syndicates.
However, we recognise that the drug trafficking syndicates are constantly evolving their mode of operations to circumvent our laws. The new law has thus brought some successes, which have assisted CNB to maintain its tough and vigilant enforcement approach. We have a zero-tolerance approach against drugs and the measures we have taken – tough laws, robust enforcement and preventive drug education seek to tackle both the supply and demand for drugs. In doing so, we are able to keep the drug situation under control.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is AVA doing to solve the pigeon problem in the vicinity of Sembawang Drive; (b) how many complaints of bird nuisance have been received on the AVA hotline in the past 12 months and what action has been taken; (c) whether AVA has carried out any study to understand the habits of these birds so as to find a long-term solution to the problem; and (d) whether AVA is working with any non-government organisation to find ways to keep these birds away from urban built-up areas.
: In the past 12 months, AVA received 6,694 feedback on bird nuisance. Addressing bird nuisance requires cooperation and coordination amongst members of the public, the Town Councils, and Government agencies including AVA and NEA.
AVA is the First Responder for animal-related feedback, and will then work with the relevant agencies on an appropriate and coordinated response. Specifically for the pigeon nuisance at Sembawang Drive, a successful response requires the pigeon feeders to cease their pigeon feeding activities. This requires public education and effective enforcement both by AVA and the Town Council. Separately, the Town Council will need to manage and control the pigeon population. We also require NEA to ensure proper food waste management at the food establishments, and enforce against littering offences. Community and grassroots leaders can help by educating residents not to feed the birds.
In 2012, AVA commissioned a study on the ecology and population management of mynahs by the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (NUS), now known as the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. The study was concluded in June 2013 and AVA is currently doing trials on the various recommendations in the report. For example, AVA worked with the Choa Chu Kang Town Council in February 2015 to install a bird deterrent gel as a trial. The preliminary results were promising as the gel deterred birds from roosting, reducing incidences of bird nuisance. If it is confirmed to be effective, AVA will work with relevant stakeholders to extend it to other sites.
Addressing bird nuisance requires joint efforts. In particular, it is important that residents do not feed birds and thereby encourage their population growth.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) what guidelines does NParks use to determine whether trees in public spaces are overgrown and require pruning; and (b) how does NParks ensure that the landscape contractors maintain the trees according to the prescribed guidelines and the public is aware of these guidelines.
: Tree pruning is done primarily to maintain the health of the trees and remove weak branches for public safety. Trees along roadsides are also pruned for vehicular clearance. It is not advisable to prune trees excessively as it can affect their health and reduce their ability to withstand strong winds. When NParks receives requests from the public for trees to be pruned, trained officers will assess if this is needed, and if so, work with their contractors on what needs to be done.
These contractors are required to send their workers for formal training under the Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) System for Landscape. Their key technical supervisors are also required to be trained and certified by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA), which is the world’s largest professional body for arboriculture.
asked the Minister for National Development in light of the recent incident where a toddler's head is caught between the ledge of the service yard of a HDB flat and a laundry pole, whether HDB will consider improving the design of service yards in HDB flats.
: Service yards provided in HDB flats are semi-open spaces for residents to hang their clothes. They also come with water and electrical points, and space for a washing machine.
The design of the service yard does take into consideration the safety and general security of the residents. For example, the parapet height is 1.1 metres, above the safety barrier height requirement of 1 metre set by the Building & Construction Authority. There is a door between the service yard and the kitchen and it can be locked from the inside of the flat to address safety aspects.
Additionally, flat owners who wish to put in more safety measures, like installing window grilles, can apply to HDB for approval.
asked the Minister for National Development when will the Ministry consider reducing the service and conservancy charges for residents of Yuhua who have participated in energy-saving initiatives such as installation of LED lights, solar panels, a rainwater harvesting system and a pneumatic waste conveyance system under the HDB Greenprint Fund programme since 2012.
: This is something for the local Town Council to decide, after taking into account the net savings in their operating cost as a result of the Greenprint project. They will also have to consider the rising cost of the other components of Town Council’s operation. Greenprint helps but it is still a small component of the total Town Council’s annual expenditure.
asked the Minister for National Development what are the guidelines used in balancing the needs of conservationists and recreational users with respect to nature reserves such as the Butterfly Trail.
: NParks provides for recreational activities in the Nature Reserves, so long as they do not cause serious damage to the environment. NParks has developed hiking trails, boardwalks, a tree top walk, a viewing tower and other visitor amenities in the Reserves. We have about 1.2 million visitors per year.
NParks also allows higher impact activities like mountain biking, in the Nature Parks, which act as green buffers for the Nature Reserves. For example, NParks developed the Bukit Timah Mountain Bike Trail that runs through Hindhede Nature Park and Dairy Farm Nature Park, so that bikers can enjoy the forested ambience. This minimises the impact on the adjacent Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.
The Butterfly Trail in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve is currently closed due to the ongoing construction of Chestnut Nature Park, which is next to the Trail. NParks is studying the use of the Trail further. In the meantime, there will be trails for mountain biking and other activities at the new Chestnut Nature Park. With these, we will have a total of 30 kilometres of biking trails in our parks and nature areas.
Our Nature Reserves are for all Singaporeans. They must be managed sustainably, as their ecosystems are fragile. The Reserves are home to more than 1,000 plant species and 500 animal species. Many are endangered and found only in the Reserves. With careful planning of the activities within and around them, our natural heritage can be enjoyed by all, both now and in the future.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the rationale for having a construction staging site so near to the residential area at Tanjong Rhu; and (b) whether more measures can be taken to ensure that heavy vehicles travelling to the staging site do not cause disamenities to other road users.
: We have to site construction staging grounds along the coastline to allow the transfer of excavated materials to barges for subsequent disposal at offshore sites. We also need to spread out the staging grounds to facilitate disposal of the excavated materials from construction projects across the island.
The Marina East staging ground is one of three locations found suitable, with the other two being at Changi and at Tuas. It is a temporary staging ground and is segregated from the existing residential area with planting of trees along Fort Road.
LTA has also adopted a series of measures to minimise disamenities to road users in the vicinity of the staging ground. First, adequate queue bays are provided within the staging ground so that trucks do not overflow into public roads.
Second, LTA has significantly enhanced the throughput of the staging ground so as to minimise the queue of trucks.
Third, LTA has reduced truck volumes at Marina East Staging Ground by diverting some trucks to the site at Changi East.
asked the Minister for National Development what will be the total number of BTO flats to be built next year with a breakdown of these flats by flat types.
: After a significant ramp up in BTO supply, we have cleared the first-timer demand backlog, and the resale market is moderating nicely. This has allowed us to start tapering our BTO supply last year. This year, we have settled on a BTO supply of about 15,000 flats. We are studying the BTO supply for 2016 and will announce the details when ready.
asked the Prime Minister from 2011 to 2014, how many licensed fund managers were exempted from the requirement to hold a capital markets services licence under section 99 of the Securities and Futures Act.
: Prior to August 2012, fund managers who served 30 or less qualified investors
1
were not required to hold a capital markets services licence for fund management under the Securities and Futures Act. These fund managers were known as Exempt Fund Managers or EFMs. All other fund managers had to apply for a licence and meet prescribed regulatory requirements.
In August 2012, MAS decided to discontinue the EFM regime and gave the EFMs a grace period to either apply for a licence, or register as Registered Fund Management Companies (RFMC). This was to raise regulatory standards and supervisory oversight of the fund management industry. Unlike EFMs, RFMCs have to meet prescribed admission criteria and business conduct requirements. RFMCs can only serve up to 30 qualified investors and manage up to S$250 million in assets. All other fund managers will require licensing and have to meet regulatory requirements that are more stringent than those applicable to RFMCs.
The number of fund managers who obtained EFM status in 2011 and 2012 (up to August 2012), are as follows
January to December 2011 95
January to August 2012 80
When the EFM regime was discontinued in August 2012, there were 527 EFMs. Of the 527 EFMs, 408 applied to be licensed or be registered as a RFMC. The remaining 119 ceased their fund management activity. All fund managers are listed on the financial institutions directory on the MAS website.
asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the number of individuals who have been declared bankrupt, whether voluntary or otherwise, as a result of credit card debt in the last three years; and (b) whether these figures suggest a need to introduce measures that make credit cards less accessible or to lower credit limits.
: According to the Insolvency & Public Trustee’s Office, 1,760 individuals became bankrupt last year, compared to 2,000 and 1,750 individuals in 2013 and 2012 respectively. Among those who became bankrupt, 41% cited excessive use of credit as the cause, slightly down from 46% in 2009. The types of credit include not only credit cards, but also business loans and hire-purchase spending on cars.
While the number of individuals made bankrupt as a result of credit card debt is not very large, Mr de Souza has raised a valid concern about the dangers of excessive borrowing.
MAS has put in place various measures in recent years to encourage prudent borrowing. These include the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework for housing loans, to ensure that individuals purchasing property do not borrow beyond their means. MAS also imposes loan-to-value and loan tenure limits on housing and motor vehicle loans extended by financial institutions to encourage financial prudence.
For credit cards, only individuals with annual incomes of $30,000 or more can qualify for credit cards. The amount of credit that each financial institution can extend via unsecured credit facilities is limited to four times the monthly income of the borrower. These are long-standing safeguards.
Further, last month, a limit to how much an individual can borrow from all financial institutions came into effect. It caps the total outstanding unsecured credit that a borrower can obtain from all financial institutions. The borrowing limit has been set at an initial level of 24 times the borrower’s monthly income, and will be lowered progressively to 18 times from 1 June 2017 and 12 times from 1 June 2019.
For unsecured borrowers who have already accumulated significant unsecured debts before June, the banking industry, together with Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS), launched a new debt repayment solution in April this year, known as the Repayment Assistance Scheme, to help them repay their debts over time. The application window for the scheme closes at the end of this year, so I urge eligible borrowers to apply soon if they find it suitable. Borrowers who are unsure can contact CCS to find out more about the scheme and other repayment solutions that are available.
MAS will also continue to work with MoneySENSE ج¶ a national financial education programme ج¶ to raise public awareness on debt management.
asked the Prime Minister (a) in the past five years, what is the total number and percentage of (i) permanent residents (PRs) who are spouses/siblings of Singapore citizens; and (ii) new PRs who are spouses/siblings of Singapore citizens; and (b) whether a zero growth rate for PRs will be maintained in view of the increasing number of Singaporeans who are married to foreigners.
: Between 2010 to 2014, an average of 4,000 spouses of Singapore Citizens (SCs) were granted Permanent Residence (PR) under the Family Ties Scheme each year. This is a slight increase over the average of 3,800 per year between 2010 and 2012. As at 31 December 2014, there were 62,100 spouses of SCs who were PRs granted under the Family Ties Scheme, an increase compared to 58,600 at the end of 2012. The above figures do not include spouses who obtained PR on their own merits or those who were already PRs at the time of marriage to SCs.
While the number of marriages between SCs and foreigners has risen over the last decade, the numbers have remained relatively stable in the past five years at around 6,700 on average. All else being equal, applicants with an SC spouse are more likely to obtain PR, compared to applicants without a Singaporean nexus.
ICA does not track the number of PRs who are siblings of SCs, as these applicants are not eligible to be considered under the Family Ties Scheme. They are considered on their own merits when they apply for PR.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs for the estates of Kovan/Hillside/Rosyth clusters and Serangoon Gardens where there are many narrow roads and kerbside parking of vehicles is allowed (a) whether SCDF has detailed plans to ensure that SCDF personnel have physical access and egress to and from residences for emergency response in these areas; and (b) if so, what are the details of these plans.
: The Kovan/Hillside/Rosyth clusters and Serangoon Gardens comprise mainly of low-density landed residential estates which have narrow roads. The SCDF Division which provides emergency services for these estates conducts regular ground surveys to familiarise their responders with the specific operational challenges of the area. The operational challenges include difficulties in emergency vehicle access because of the narrow roads, which are exacerbated by the incidence of illegal kerbside parking.
When the SCDF comes across in their ground surveys such areas with illegal parking that may hinder its emergency vehicle access, they will notify the LTA to conduct regular enforcement action against the illegally-parked vehicles. Errant vehicle owners may be fined or awarded demerit points to deter recurrent offences.
To address the terrain challenges of residential estates such as the Kovan/Hillside/Rosyth clusters and Serangoon Gardens, the SCDF would also dispatch their fleet of smaller, more maneuverable emergency vehicles such as the Light Fire Attack Vehicle, Class 3 Emergency Ambulances and Fire Bikes together with the larger fire engines when responding to emergencies in such neighbourhoods. This will enable the SCDF to effectively access the narrower roads without undue delay.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether citizenship can be granted to parents/grandparents of Singapore citizens above the age of 60 who have been PRs and lived in Singapore for more than 20 years to look after their Singaporean children/grandchildren; and (b) whether foreign spouses of Singapore citizens who have three or more Singaporean children can be given priority to be granted citizenship.
: Elderly parents of Singapore Citizens (SCs) may be granted Singapore Citizenship under the sponsorship of their SC children. The applications will be assessed on a range of criteria, which include the length of time the adult child/children has been an SC (for naturalised SCs) and the elderly person’s length of residence in Singapore, whether all their adult children are SCs, the contributions of the adult SC children to Singapore and the financial ability of the SC child/children to support the elderly parents. SCs can sponsor only their immediate family members, namely, parents, spouse and children for SC. They are not able to sponsor their grandparents for SC.
Foreign spouses of SCs may be granted Permanent Residence (PR) or Singapore Citizenship under the Family Ties Scheme (FTS). Each PR or SC application for a foreign spouse is evaluated holistically on a range of criteria, which include the ability of the SC sponsor to support the family, the length of marriage and whether the couple have any children from the marriage. If the couple have children from their marriage, this will be a plus factor although having more children does not necessarily mean that the applicant has higher priority as applications are assessed holistically.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs whether he can provide an update on the status of the criminal proceedings against the suspect arrested in connection with the killing of two persons in the vicinity of Hillside/Kovan in July 2013.
: With regard to the double murder at Hillside Drive reported on 10 July 2013, the accused was charged in Court on 15 July 2013. He is facing two counts of murder under Section 300(a) of the Penal Code and is currently remanded at Changi Prison Complex, pending Court proceedings. A Committal Hearing has been scheduled on 29 July 2015, for the Judge to decide whether or not to commit the accused to a High Court Trial. In the event that the accused is committed to stand trial in the High Court, the trial dates will be from 20 to 30 October 2015 and 29 March to 8 April 2016.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) from 2010 to 2015, how many listed companies and non-listed private firms have been found to be non-compliant in their annual filing of accounts; (b) what are the reasons for their failure to file their returns punctually; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider making it compulsory for these companies to hire corporate service providers or professional secretarial firms to train their first-time directors on the basic and key statutory requirements of the Companies Act and to improve their corporate governance.
: Under section 197 of the Companies Act, every locally-incorporated company is required to file its Annual Return with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) within one month after its annual general meeting. ACRA sends out letters and emails to companies to remind them to hold their annual general meetings and file their Annual Returns. About nine in 10 live companies comply.
If a company fails to file its accounts in its Annual Return submission when required to do so
2
, it will be treated as non-compliant in filing its Annual Return. The following table shows the number and percentage of companies on ACRA’s register that were non-compliant from 2010 to 30 June 2015
3
. 9.5% of companies were non-compliant as at end-June 2015, down from 11.3% about five years ago.
As at 30 June 2015, two listed companies were non-compliant in filing their Annual Returns. This constitutes less than half of one percent of all listed companies
4
.
The most common reason cited by companies for not filing Annual Returns punctually is oversight or ignorance on the part of the director. Other reasons include (i) internal disputes among the directors and/or shareholders of the company; (ii) inability to locate the managing directors of the company, with the remaining directors lacking the information required to file the Annual Return; and (iii) inability of the director responsible for filing the Annual Return to do so for medical reasons.
Mandating non-compliant companies to hire corporate service providers or professional secretarial firms to train first-time directors will increase business costs without necessarily addressing the reasons for non-compliance. ACRA’s approach has instead sought to raise awareness in a targeted way. In November 2014, ACRA launched the Directors’ Compliance Programme to train first-time offending directors who have failed to file the Annual Return. The training focuses on general director duties and common statutory requirements under the Companies Act, and is offered in lieu of prosecution. To date, about 1,500 directors have been trained under the programme. ACRA seeks to train up to 9,000 directors in FY2015.
For new and aspiring business owners, ACRA conducts outreach talks to help them understand the requirements for starting a business and their statutory obligations. Over 3,000 individuals have attended these talks since the latest series of talks started in 2013. ACRA has also published a handbook to help directors understand their statutory obligations

asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance from 2011 to 2014, how many limited partnerships were registered under the Limited Partnerships Act.
: The following table shows the number of limited partnerships (LPs)
6
registered from 2011 to 2014.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether Singapore will slide into a longer period of deflation after the headline inflation has slipped into negative territory for the seventh consecutive month in May 2015 and what will be the implications of prolonged deflation for Singapore.
: In the first five months of 2015, CPI-All Items inflation averaged -0.4% on a year-on-year basis. However, the negative inflation rates are not an indication that the Singapore economy is experiencing deflation, as the price declines are not broad-based nor are they expected to persist.
First, the negative rates of inflation experienced were primarily due to price declines in specific categories of the consumption basket, rather than broad-based price declines which would have been symptomatic of a general weakness in demand in the economy. In particular, the negative inflation rates largely reflected the impact of three factors
a. Lower car prices and housing rentals, which contributed to a 0.7 percentage-point drop in CPI-All Items inflation on average in the first five months of the year. These price declines were in turn the result of a deliberate effort by the Government to cool the property market, following the sharp run-up in housing costs over the past few years, as well as lower Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums this year due to an increase in the supply of COEs. Excluding the costs of private road transport and accommodation, MAS Core Inflation, which is a better measure of underlying price pressures, was positive at 0.8% from January to May 2015.
b. The sharp fall in global oil prices since late 2014, which has dampened the domestic prices of oil-related items, including petrol, electricity and gas. In all, the decline in the prices of oil-related items contributed to a 0.6 percentage-point drop in CPI-All Items inflation on average in the first five months of the year.
c. The disinflationary impact of a suite of budgetary measures introduced by the Government to help households cope with the cost of living. These include measures like enhancements to medical subsidies and waiver of national examination fees, which have lowered the prices of consumption items such as healthcare services, medication and education.
Second, the dampening effects of lower oil prices and budgetary measures are expected to dissipate. Specifically, the Brent benchmark oil price recently rose from a trough of US$49 to around US$64, and market expectations are for prices to edge up gradually into 2016. As such, the drag posed by oil-related items on overall inflation on a year-on-year basis should dissipate towards the end of the year and into 2016. Similarly, the impact of the budgetary measures on year-on-year inflation is expected to start to dissipate towards the end of the year.
Reflecting these factors, the MAS Core Inflation is expected to stay subdued at around the current rate over the next few months, while CPI-All Items inflation could ease further due to the drag from car prices and housing rentals. However, both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are projected to rise towards the end of the year and into 2016, on account of higher global oil prices and as the effects of the budgetary measures dissipate. For 2015 as a whole, MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are expected to average 0.5% to 1.5% and -0.5% to 0.5%, respectively.
In sum, MTI’s and MAS’s assessment is that the Singapore economy is not experiencing deflation nor is it likely to slip into deflation. MTI and MAS will continue to closely monitor price developments in the economy.
asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry can consider allowing foreign workers under the services sector quota to be housed at approved purpose-built dormitories similar to the provision for foreign workers in the construction and marine sectors.
: Commercial purpose-built dormitories under the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), the Housing Development Board (HDB) and the JTC Corporation (JTC) are allowed to house work permit holders from all industrial sectors, including the services sector, for up to 25% of each dormitory’s capacity. Businesses with specific needs may approach the relevant agencies overseeing the dormitory where they intend to house their workers.
asked the Minister for Manpower what action does the Ministry take against employers who violate the Employment Act when they do not pay CPF contributions for their part-time, freelance or contract employees; (b) how many complaints of non-payment from such employees has the Ministry received since 2011; and (c) to what extent has the 2012 "Work Right" initiative improved the situation of non-payment of CPF to part-time, freelance, contract and other non-permanent employees.
: Employers are required to make CPF contributions for all their local employees (Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) earning a monthly salary of more than $50, including those on term contract, part-time or casual work arrangement so long as there is an employer-employee relationship.
Employers found to have not complied with their CPF obligations will be required not only to make good the CPF contributions due to their employees, but also be charged a late payment interest of 1.5% a month, and/or imposed with a composition fine. Employers convicted under the CPF Act could face a fine of up to $5,000 per offence and/or jail term of up to six months. Repeat offenders could be subject to a fine of up to $10,000 per offence and/or jail term of up to 12 months.
MOM and CPF Board jointly launched the “WorkRight” initiative in 2012 to improve compliance with the Employment Act and the CPF Act through public education and enforcement. Outreach campaigns were conducted to raise awareness among employees of their employment rights and among employers of their statutory obligations to their employees, including their CPF obligations. The number of onsite inspections was also stepped up by more than ten times to more than 5,000 inspections annually. We also receive complaints/enquiries from employees and members of the public. As of 1 April 2015, WorkRight has benefitted more than 42,000 Singaporeans who now enjoy their statutory entitlements such as CPF contributions, timely payment of salary, or payment of overtime allowance.
Between January 2011 and December 2014, CPF Board acted on about 3,400 complaint cases involving non-payment of CPF contributions, and recovered $9.8 million of CPF contributions for more than 5,800 employees. About a quarter of these cases involved staff employed on a part-time, casual or temporary basis.
asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry tracks data that quantifies the association between attending Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses and the successful trainee attaining a higher income as a result of the CET course and, if so, whether the data can be published on a regular basis.
: Skills development and lifelong learning are key to helping Singaporeans remain employable and to have good careers in the fast-changing global economy. We all need to continually upgrade and re-skill to remain competitive and employable.
Since 2009, the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) has been conducting annual Outcome Evaluation Surveys on training outcomes of individuals who undertook training under the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) system. The survey covers both individuals and employers. It aims to find out if individuals are able to apply their skills, advance their careers, or achieve job mobility after attending training. Findings from the annual surveys are already published.
Based on the latest published findings in 2014
7
, 19% of respondents reported receiving a pay increment and 37% received a new or enlarged job scope. This is an increase from 15% and 34% respectively from the previous survey. In addition, 95% of the respondents said that WSQ training helped them perform more efficiently and effectively at work.
WDA has also conducted a longitudinal study to compare the wages of individuals who had attended WSQ training with those who had not. The study, completed in 2013, showed that overall individuals who completed some WSQ training
8
had higher wages of 1.3% to 4.3% compared to those who did not. Individuals who attained full WSQ qualifications had even better wage outcomes, with higher wages of 5.3% compared to those who only completed some WSQ training. Also, the benefits for lower-wage workers
9
were higher than average
10
.
We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our education and training system.
asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can consider providing common public waste collection points in future urban planning instead of the present collection of single waste bins from individual houses at landed properties.
: The present system of refuse bins placed outside individual homes is a practical method of waste collection. It is convenient for residents and does not require land to be set aside for centralised collection points.
As for local dis-amenities which may arise from this system, the National Environment Agency’s licensing framework for waste collectors contains regulations, such as on collection timings, which minimise disruption to residents and ensure a satisfactory standard of waste collection.
However, some precincts have unique characteristics which may favour centralised waste collection. If there is strong interest from local residents for common waste collection points to be provided there, we are prepared to consider the proposal.
asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider allowing private property owners to buy a resale HDB flat given the current situation in the resale market.
: Private residential property owners (PPOs) are allowed to buy a resale HDB flat, but they are required to dispose of their private property within six months from the date of the resale flat purchase. This is to reinforce the principle that HDB flats are for long-term owner-occupation. This is also to dampen the demand for resale flats from buyers with no urgent need of housing.
asked the Minister for National Development how much Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) funding has been extended to each Town Council through their respective Citizens' Consultative Committee (CCC) from 7 May 2011.
: The Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) provides funding support for improvement projects in HDB estates for the benefit of local residents. Such facilities include covered walkways, footpaths, cycling tracks and playgrounds.
CIPC funding is disbursed through the Citizens’ Consultative Committees (CCCs). CCCs are close to the ground and can help identify projects which will be most useful for the residents, and through that process, strengthen bonds within the community.
CIPC allocates its budget to the CCCs each year based on the number of HDB residential units of each Town. CCCs have the flexibility to allocate their notional budget and prioritise projects within their Towns based on local needs and which will be most useful for the residents.
Town Councils may approach their respective CCCs if they have any enquiries or proposals.
asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB will consider conserving the flats at Dakota Crescent built by the former Singapore Improvement Trust instead of demolishing the flats.
: The Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) blocks were built in the 1950s and are being vacated to allow the area to be developed for higher-density housing as it is near an MRT station. As we redevelop the area, we will study ways to retain some of its distinctive identity and character.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB has considered security, abuse and noise nuisance issues in the implementation of rooftop gardens that are built on top of multi-storey carparks of new HDB developments which are often situated very close to residential units; (b) to prevent misuse by drug users, late night drinking and overnight gatherings, whether HDB will consider installing limited security access for residents only; and (c) whether HDB will consider working with the police to install CCTV cameras at such rooftop gardens for close monitoring and prevention of abuse.
: Rooftop gardens at HDB multi-storey car parks (MSCP) provide greenery and recreational space for residents. HDB takes care to place facilities which may be noise-generating further from the flats to reduce potential dis-amenity. Plants are also provided close to the flats to address privacy concerns of the residents.
Facilities within public housing estates are designed to be open and accessible to all. Similar to landscaped spaces on the ground, rooftop gardens are communal spaces for people to meet, mingle and interact with one another. They are not intended for the exclusive use of one group of residents.
HDB works closely with the Singapore Police Force (SPF) to ensure safe and secure neighbourhoods. While there are no plans to install CCTV cameras at all MSCP roof gardens, such initiatives will be considered should there be security or crime concerns at these areas. As the existing roof gardens form part of the common property under the management and maintenance of the Town Councils, Town Councils could also liaise with SPF to assess the viability of installing CCTV cameras at localised areas where there are safety and security concerns, especially those covering the ingress and egress into existing blocks.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in view of the possible return of the El Nino weather conditions (a) how prepared is Singapore to deal with the hotter, drier climate in terms of water supply; and (b) how is Singapore preparing for the protection of green areas including the prevention of bush fires.
: PUB has made major investments to bolster our water security over many decades. NEWater and desalinated water, which are weather-resilient sources, were introduced to supplement our local catchment and imported water sources. Today, these weather-resilient sources are able to provide 55% of Singapore’s water demand, and will provide a safety margin during dry periods. Thus, despite experiencing the longest dry spell in 149 years in 2014, as well as the dry weather earlier this year, we did not have to put in place mandatory water restriction measures or water rationing.
The construction of a third desalination plant in Tuas will begin later this year, and additional desalination plants are being planned for. These projects will ensure that we continue to be resilient during periods of drought in the future.
However, we must not be complacent. Climate change will bring more extreme weather including more frequent and more prolonged dry spells. We have also noticed that water consumption increases during dry periods despite reminders to conserve water. We are thus studying the need for legislative amendments to impose water restrictions for non-essential activities, such as the washing of cars, watering of grass and lawns and water features, during severe droughts. If everyone puts in effort to conserve water, this will go a long way in ensuring resilience of our water supply under all circumstances.
The Wildfire Task Force (WFTF), led by SCDF and comprising HDB, SLA, NEA, NParks, JTC and MINDEF, was set up in 2005 to drive a Whole-of-Government approach to address the risk of vegetation fires, especially during dry weather. The task force convenes regularly to share statistics on vegetation fires, weather updates and potential hotspots. Precautionary measures are also taken by government land owners such as NParks, SLA and MINDEF. These measures include (a) vegetation trimming to reduce fire load, (b) creation of buffers to prevent fire spread, (c) increased frequency of patrols by NParks rangers, and (d) restrictions on the use of pyrotechnics during military training (where applicable).
During dry spells, agencies will implement additional fire prevention measures such as not parking vehicles or operating equipment that generate excessive sparks or heat in dry vegetation areas, and conducting more patrols or daily aerial surveillance of hotspots of their respective managed areas. SCDF will also step up patrols at potential hotspots to detect fire risks and take action to mitigate any fire occurrences.
In addition, to strengthen our emergency plans and responses, SCDF conducts regular joint wild fire simulation exercises with the relevant agencies at various locations, especially areas that are highly vegetated. A high level of emergency preparedness and validated response plans will help minimise damage to life, property and greenery, should any vegetation fire occur.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry has plans to help long-term tenants who rent their hawker stalls from the current landlord during the transition phase when the lease of a hawker centre expires and has to be returned to NEA.
: Stallholders in 15 hawker centres purchased a 20-year lease under the Stall Ownership Scheme launched between 1994 and 1997. These stall owners were allowed to sell, transfer or sublet their stalls during the lease period. The leases for these sold centres have expired or will be expiring in the next few years.
When the leases of these centres expire, all stall owners who wish to continue working personally as hawkers may take up tenancy at a NEA-managed hawker centre at the prevailing market rent. As a special concession, hawkers who were originally subsidised stall-holders would only have to pay the prevailing subsidised rent. In all cases, they would have to personally operate these stalls.
Stall operators who currently rent their stalls from stall owners in these centres may choose to participate in open tenders for vacant stalls in all our hawker centres. There are currently more than 100 vacant stalls in existing hawker centres and over 300 available stalls in new hawker centres scheduled to be completed by 2017.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether a hawker centre can be built for residents in Bukit Batok constituency.
21
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry has updates on the proposed location, size and implementation timeline for the hawker centre in Choa Chu Kang estate.
: At the Committee of Supply (COS) 2015, the Government announced that an additional 10 new hawker centres will be built by 2027. They will be located in new estates or existing ones that are relatively under-served. Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok Towns are two areas identified for these new hawker centres. As we are still in the early planning stages for these centres, the Ministry can only provide more details of the proposed hawker centres in these areas when the plans are ready.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Government will consider introducing more measures to conserve the environment like encouraging the use of more electric cars and less use of plastic bags.
: Environmental sustainability has always been a focus in the development of Singapore. Last year, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) and the Ministry of National Development (MND) released the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB) 2015. This sets out Government’s strategies for a Liveable and Endearing Home, a Vibrant and Sustainable City, and an Active and Gracious Community. Over the next few years, the Government will implement the sustainability policies and schemes in the SSB 2015, including working towards a "Car-Lite" Singapore and a Zero Waste Nation.
The greenest transport system is one where most trips are on public transport instead of private cars. We aim for public transport to be the choice mode for Singaporeans – accessible, connected, comfortable and green. To this end, the Government is significantly enhancing the rail and bus networks, and ramping up infrastructure to encourage more people to cycle and walk.
We are also doing more to make our vehicles greener and cleaner. From 2017, we will set higher emission standards for vehicles and will impose tighter and more comprehensive regulations on the quality of petrol and diesel fuel supplied in Singapore. We have also implemented the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS) and the Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) to incentivise the use of vehicles with cleaner emissions and a lower carbon footprint.
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Economic Development Board (EDB) are planning to trial an electric vehicle car-sharing programme to assess whether this would be feasible in our local context.
To work towards a Zero Waste Nation, many initiatives are being introduced to conserve the environment through the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle). For example, food waste recycling pilots are being implemented at two hawker centres and centralised recycling chutes will be installed for all new Build-To-Order flats to make recycling more convenient for residents.
MEWR and NEA are supportive of the efforts taken by various retailers and supermarkets to reduce the excessive use of plastic bags. For example, since 2007, NTUC’s FairPrice Green Rewards scheme has provided a 10-cent rebate for customers who bring their own bags and spend a minimum of $10. In 2014, more than nine million plastic bags were saved through this scheme. Another example is that of IKEA Singapore, which started charging for disposal plastic bags in 2007 and stopped providing them altogether in 2013. We also encourage households to re-use their plastic bags, such as in using them to bag their refuse to ensure good public hygiene.
Everyone has a part to play in taking stewardship of our environment and sustainable development. MEWR, MND and other agencies are working to bring about closer partnership between the public, private and people sectors for all Singaporeans to participate in caring for our common spaces and environment for a more Sustainable Singapore.
asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what is the Government's foreign policy on the Rohingya situation in Myanmar which is causing a refugee crisis in Southeast Asia; and (b) whether the Government has raised any concerns on the situation with senior members of the Myanmar Government and Opposition and, if so, what are their responses.
: The Government’s foreign policy on the Rohingya situation in Myanmar will be elaborated on in our oral reply to related questions raised by Mr Christopher de Souza.
We have raised our views on the communal tensions in Myanmar with the Myanmars. As these discussions have taken place within the framework of diplomatic communications, it would not be appropriate to disclose the details.
asked the Minister for Law (a) how many cases or complaints involving the practice of speculative invoicing have been received by the Ministry and its statutory boards including the Legal Aid Bureau over the past five years; (b) whether there are sufficient legal safeguards against such practices; and (c) what kind of legal assistance will the Ministry offer to the recipients of such letters of demand.
: Speculative invoicing is a term commonly used in the context of copyright infringement on the Internet to refer to the practice where rights-holders send letters of demand to a large number of account holders who are alleged to be copyright infringers. The letter will typically indicate the sender’s willingness to settle the matter upon the recipient paying a sum of money, and imply that otherwise, legal action may be commenced.
The act of sending a letter of demand is not wrongful by itself, unless it contravenes a lawyer’s professional obligations. Letters of demand containing an offer to settle or stating a willingness to settle are common as they allow parties to resolve disputes amicably and quickly. Lawyers who send letters of demand are bound by professional obligations to behave in an ethical manner. The Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules state that a lawyer shall not demand anything other than that recoverable by due process of law, and the Law Society’s Practice Directions prohibit lawyers from threatening criminal proceedings to coerce other parties, or from using offensive or acrimonious language. Any person who believes that a lawyer is guilty of professional misconduct can lodge a complaint with the Law Society.
The Ministry of Law and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) received two complaints and 26 queries respectively on speculative invoicing issues relating to a rights-holder's enforcement action for alleged copyright infringement of the Dallas Buyers Club movie. We are not aware of any other complaints or queries on speculative invoicing over the past five years.
Recipients of demand letters can seek legal advice from legal professionals or from the Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) if they satisfy the requisite means and merits tests. If the letter involves intellectual property matters, they can also seek assistance from IPOS’ IP Legal Clinics.
asked the Minister for Health with the onset of a hotter and drier weather (a) what steps are being taken to create greater public awareness of heat-related illnesses especially among the elderly; and (b) what are the common illnesses under such weather conditions.
: In very hot weather, some people may be at risk of heat-induced illnesses which include heat rashes, heat cramps, heat exhaustion and the more severe heat stroke.
Some precautions that can be taken to prevent heat-induced illnesses include wearing loose-fitting, heat permeable and light coloured clothing, drinking fluids to stay hydrated, taking more breaks between activities, reducing outdoor activities during the hottest time of the day or staying in the shade, and watching for early signs of heat injury and seeking medical attention if the condition persists or worsens.
So far, heat-induced illnesses do not seem to be a major problem in Singapore. The number of hospital admissions for heat-induced illness has decreased over the years. This could be due to the preventive measures taken by the population against heat exposure. Currently, the risk of heat-induced illnesses is highest among those who are physically active outdoors. Few elderly are hospitalised for heat-induced illnesses.
Nevertheless, we will work with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to provide relevant information to the public to prepare them for hot weather.
asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the amount of research funding set aside for cancer research in Singapore; (b) what portion of this is allocated for brain tumour research; and (c) what is the current number of patients suffering from brain tumour in both private and public hospitals.
: Research is an important enabler that creates medical discoveries and innovations which can improve the health and well-being of Singaporeans. Over the years, MOH has set up multiple initiatives to build up our translational and clinical research capabilities, develop research talent, and fund research programmes and projects that improve medical care and human health in Singapore.
From 2006 to 2012, MOH spent approximately $210 million on cancer research in general. Specifically, $1.1 million went towards brain tumour research. In the same period, there was also funding of more than $50 million for non-site specific cancer research, which included research on tumours that had spread to different parts of the body and did not have a defined primary site.
Other public sector agencies also provide a significant amount of funding to research in scientific areas that contribute to cancer research, such as cell and molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. These agencies include the National Research Foundation (NRF), the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR).
In the last five years (2010 to 2014), based on data from the National Registry of Diseases Office (NRDO), the average number of new brain tumour cases reported per year was approximately 400, or 3.3% of the 12,300 new cancer cases. Most of these cases were reported in public healthcare institutions.
asked the Minister for Transport whether the Government will consider reducing the contribution rate of de-registered Category D (motorcycles) COEs to Category E (open) from the current 10% to 0% in order to return more COEs from de-registered motorcycles to Category D and mitigate the price of quota premiums for motorcycle owners, many of whom are from lower income groups and need their motorcycles for work.
: Category E (or Open Category) Certificates of Entitlement (COE) can be used to register vehicles from any category. This provides some flexibility in the Vehicle Quota System to accommodate changing demands for different types of vehicle. Currently, all vehicle categories contribute 10% of their quota to Category E. This rate has been gradually reduced from 25% over the last three years, with the most recent reduction from 15% to 10% taking effect in February 2015.
We will continue to review the contribution rate to Category E periodically to strike a balance between the demand within each category and the need for flexibility for the system.
asked the Minister for Education (a) how many private education institutions have had their registrations cancelled or not renewed by the Council for Private Education since the enactment of the Private Education Act; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider equipping prospective students with information about each private education institution's track record in Singapore.
: The Private Education Act ("the Act") was enacted in 2009 with the primary aim of protecting the interests of students, by setting basic standards in corporate and academic governance, strengthening student fee protection measures, and requiring private education institutions (PEIs) to disclose key information on courses and teachers.
Any PEI that has been found to have contravened the requirements of the Act can have its registration period shortened, suspended or cancelled. Since 2009, CPE has received a total of 526 complete applications for renewal of registration, of which 8 were rejected. Separately, 4 PEIs have had their registrations cancelled because of regulatory contraventions.
Details of regulatory actions that are taken against PEIs have been published on CPE’s website since 2011, and further enhancements have been made recently. Details of enforcement action taken are now published directly under the PEI’s profile page on CPE’s website, in addition to the separate section on enforcement actions. Former names of PEIs are also published along with their current names, so that the public will be able to find information pertaining to the track record of a PEI even if it has changed its company name.
Besides taking regulatory action, CPE engages students and parents through consumer education and student support initiatives. As part of its outreach efforts, CPE participates in fairs and talks targeted at students from local post-secondary education institutions. In 2013, it collaborated with the Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Career Guidance Branch to incorporate links to student guides developed by CPE on the Education and Career Guidance online portal, such as the "Guide for Choosing a Private Education Institution". In the same year, CPE also implemented a "Student Advisories" section within its website to publish cautionary announcements and information that prospective students should take note of before choosing an institution.
CPE continues to work on enhancing its consumer education efforts to help prospective students and parents to make more informed choices.
asked the Minister for Education (a) since January 2012, how many scholarships have been awarded each year by Ministries to international students to do their undergraduate studies at our local universities; and (b) what is the current average cost of each scholarship a year including but not limited to school fees, accommodation and other allowances.
: The annual number of scholarships awarded to international students at the undergraduate level has come down in recent years. Since 2012, about 900 such scholarships are awarded each year.
The scholarships include school fees, and typically include accommodation and some allowances. The annual cost per scholarship is about $25,000 on average.
