            "Mdm Chair, in all religions, the places of worship have always been useful focal points for communities. These places can be used for community outreach initiatives too. Given the faith and trust people have in them, these places of worship are suitable places to rally for and gather resources and donations. I hope that we can get more mosques involved in providing support for the less well-off Malay/Muslim families.",
            "Last year, the Minister announced details for the Nadi Khidmat@Mosques programme which seeks to improve accessibility to social services for Malay/Muslim families through the help of the participating mosques. I thought it was a good move as it not only encourages community involvement and the mosques, it also encourages shared responsibilities to help the Malay community progress further.",
            "Mdm Chair, I would like to ask if Mendaki and MUIS have been able to draw more partners and other organisations to participate in this good initiative. What other measures are being taken and what other resources are being used to expand the Nadi Khidmat@Mosques initiative?",

            "Last Saturday, I attended the ground-breaking event for the Yusof Ishak Mosque in Woodlands Drive 17. I was very happy to be there together with a few other Members of this House, as well as Puan Noor Aishah, wife of our late President Yusof Ishak. Residents in Woodlands are of course very happy that the construction of this second modern mosque in Woodlands will be completed in two years.",
            "Mosques have a special place in the hearts of the Malay/Muslim community and play a central role in their lives. Mosques are not just places of worship; they are also institutions that fulfil the community's needs. Mosques are also centres of information, learning, personal improvement and also an agent for social cohesion.",
            "Yusof Ishak Mosque is a very special mosque. It bears the name of Singapore's founding President Mr Yusof Ishak, a national icon and a pride of our Malay/Muslim community. I was happy to learn that the Yusof Ishak Mosque will have a heritage corner to honour the contributions of our pioneers.",
            "President Yusof Ishak was loved by Muslims and non-Muslims alike – a President for all Singaporeans. He was very active in the community and was an all-rounder, a journalist, a respected statesman, a sportsman and also a bright scholar. In our continuing efforts to build a progressive Malay/Muslim community in Singapore, it is fitting that the mosque is named after a luminary like President Yusof Ishak, and that we promote the values of excellence, and racial and religious harmony, which he held.",
            "The construction plans for Yusof Ishak Mosque was off to a very good start. The Mosque Building Committee led by Haji Ayub Johari is working hard to collect funds. At the ground-breaking event, a number of non-Muslim grassroots leaders asked me how they can also support the construction of this community institution in Woodlands. I am heartened by such a supportive spirit, and inter-racial and inter-religious cooperation.",
            "The Yusof Ishak Mosque, scheduled to be ready at the end of 2016, will be able to accommodate 4,500 worshippers. It will ease overcrowding at the An-Nur Mosque, which is currently the only mosque in the North. Likewise, I am also happy that the Maarof Mosque in Jurong West, which can accommodate 4,500 people, will also relieve overcrowding at Assyakirin Mosque and Al-Mukminin Mosque.",
            "There are also other areas that need new mosques and I would like to ask the Minister what are MUIS' plans to build new mosques in other areas that also need additional space for Muslims, especially in the East, where I live.",

            "One key pillar in building our success and prosperity is the cohesion between different religions and races that was nurtured over a long time. This harmonious relationship will continue even though, from time to time, it will be tested by many developments, including incidents that happen around the world.",
            "Differences will not only exist between races and religions, in fact, it can also exist within the same race and religion. Whether it is due to opposing views or beliefs, different interpretations, lifestyle and others, differences will occur. These diversity and differences will shape a particular race or religion.",
            "We cannot deny that these things happen, but it would be wise for us to give and take and mutually understand these diversities and differences, and ensure that it will not lead to quarrels that can polarise the community and destroy our solidarity in Singapore.",
            "We have seen for ourselves several issues that can result in fragmentation, emotional discussions, and actions that, at times, invite controversy.",
            "Such matters clearly can affect the unity and harmony in society, which is something that we have fostered for 50 years, and if it is not managed well, it will cause a split in the community.",

            ": And I would also like to inform Members that I would be taking clarifications immediately after my reply. Madam, Singapore's Golden Jubilee is an opportunity for us to celebrate and pay tribute to Singaporeans for their role in nation-building. Starting with the sheer determination of our pioneers, to the continued dynamism of the generations after them, we have made Singapore a nation of opportunity for all.",
            "The Malay/Muslim community is part of Singapore's success story. Over the years we have seen successful individuals in diverse areas such as the arts, sports, business, life sciences, creative media and social entrepreneurship. Each successive generation has continued to excel and do better. The percentage of our Primary 1 cohort admitted to post-Secondary institutions has increased from under 80% to about 90% in the last 10 years, a good reflection of the hard work put in by parents and students, as well as the support provided by Government and the community. Recipients of the Mendaki Awards, which celebrate excellence in both academic and non-academic disciplines, have increased steadily, with 683 receiving awards in 2014, up from 507 in 2012. With steady improvement in our educational qualification, it is no surprise that median income and proportion of PMETs in our community has also been on a steady rise.",
            "The emerging talent base of our community reflects both the depth and potential of talent within our community. Our perseverance and ability to adapt to the needs and demands of a modern city state have put us to where we are today. Guided by these values, I am confident that we shall overcome whatever challenges come our way, and do even better in the years ahead.",
            "Madam, the foundation of our community's progress is in education and it should continue to be our focus going forward. Many national schemes over the years have supported our students' educational journey. These include MOE's financial assistance schemes for students from low-income families, enhanced bursaries for studies at Institutes of Higher Learning, and top-ups to Edusave and Post-Secondary Education accounts for learning opportunities beyond the classroom. I am happy that the recent Budget 2015 announcements have further strengthened many of these schemes to benefit our students.",
            "Mendaki has been a key community partner in ensuring that our children receive the best educational support at all levels. I am happy to share that over 14,200 students benefitted from the Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS) scheme in 2014, up from about 12,000 in 2013. This is largely due to two factors. First, we obtained the Government's approval to revise the eligibility criteria in 2012: as a result, more students now qualify. Second, in the past two years, with the Government's permission, we have extended TTFS to students pursuing studies at LASALLE College of the Arts, NAFA, Yale-NUS College, NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and SIM University. Any remaining funds are channelled to the Education Development Fund, for further education-based financial assistance and scholarships.",
            "Mendaki has recently completed a holistic review of its education initiatives. The findings by the Mendaki Education Review Committee will guide Mendaki's multi-pronged efforts for the next few years, including enhancing tutor development and improving parent education programmes. Indeed, the Committee's recommendations have inspired and will help shape some of the educational initiatives that I will be touching on next.",
            "Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim asked about Mendaki's flagship Tuition Scheme (MTS). Student participation in the Scheme has grown steadily, from under 6,500 students in 2005 to close to 10,000 students in 2014, spread across 50 centres. To ensure effectiveness, Mendaki conducts regular reviews and feedback sessions, all of which have led to improvements in areas like student-teacher ratio, tutor training and student motivation. For instance, the latest review last year saw the student-teacher ratio reduced for students in Primary 6, Secondary 4 and 5, from 1:16 to 1:8, and even lower to 1:4 during their critical national examination periods. Following students' feedback, MENDAKI also organised a \"Study Skills\" workshop for Secondary 3, 4 and 5 students, to share tips on effective study habits.",
            "For the year ahead, Mendaki will increase accessibility for its students, by expanding its MTS centres to six mosques. Mendaki is also looking to pilot Mentoring@MTS for 150 lower Secondary students at four centres, where they will be exposed to learning and character development activities. Other Secondary school students will also stand to benefit, with more Mendaki Homework Cafes for supervised homework sessions and peer tutoring. Started in 2013 with only two centres, there are now 15 \"cafes\" spread across the island.",
            "Beyond the school setting, this year's Budget highlighted life-long learning as a central theme to invest in our future – from pre-school all the way to working life. Dr Intan asked if there were more initiatives in the works to help parents in their children's development, particularly their Primary 1 readiness. Currently, at the pre-school level, we already have successful programmes like Cahaya M for experiential learning, Maju Minda Matematika for strengthening numeracy skills, and Keluarga Baca Bersama for reading. Mendaki also collaborates with the National Library Board on its popular reading programmes like KidsREAD, and Jiggle and Rhyme.",
            "This year, Mendaki has a number of new initiatives to provide more help to our parents. First, an \"easy-to-read\" toolkit for parents will be launched, containing tips – especially for first-time parents – on appropriate activities for their children at each key developmental stage. Second, Mendaki will also start Literacy@Home, a programme to provide parents with guidance on encouraging and improving literacy at home.",
            "Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about our mosque kindergartens. We have 18 such kindergartens, with an enrolment of about 2,600 children. MUIS and the mosques continuously improve the quality of pre-school education through teacher training and utilising various national support schemes provided by ECDA. For example, some mosque kindergartens have tapped on the Pre-school Opportunity Fund, which supports programmes benefiting children from low-income families. This year, MUIS, together with Mendaki, will also study on how to further strengthen our mosque kindergartens, so that our children will receive more support and resources.",
            "Assoc Prof Fatimah also asked about training for working adults. SENSE, the training arm of Mendaki, has empowered over 30,000 individuals in the last few years through its range of training, job matching and referral services. Given its reach to the community, SENSE will work closely with WDA to facilitate the community's adoption of WDA's upcoming Individual Learning Portfolio, which can help plan one's training and learning needs. With greater support through the SkillsFuture initiative, I am confident that we can better equip ourselves to compete in the dynamic economic environment. To guide us in this endeavour, Mendaki is designing some programmes to tap on the schemes under SkillsFuture. So, I urge our community to participate whole-heartedly when these opportunities are ready.",
            "Madam, as we nurture our young for the future, we have also been strengthening the core of our community – our families. We have seen good progress. For instance, divorce rates and minor marriages have been on a steady decline.",
            "Through the Cinta Abadi Marriage Preparation Programme, soon-to-wed couples are guided on how to build marriages for the long term, such as in developing a consultative and collaborative approach, and in managing conflict and differences. To ensure that it continues to meet the needs of couples, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will work with marriage educators to enhance the programme, including in course facilitation and delivery.",
            "Support for marriages should not stop at the pre-marriage stage. I shared last year that MSF's Inspirasi Hubs piloted a marriage enrichment programme for minor couples called \"Keluarga GEMS\" (Growing Every Marriage towards Success), to provide guidance and support to those who have been married for more than five years. With valuable feedback gathered from the pilot, we rolled out the programme proper in November 2014. Topics range from rejuvenating the marital relationship, to successful parenting. This year, MSF will develop a structured Cinta Abadi enrichment framework, targeted at Malay/Muslim couples in their first 10 years of marriage. PPIS Vista Sakinah will also be enhancing their step-parenting and marriage enrichment framework for remarriages. Our goal is for all couples to be better prepared as they go through various phases of their marriage, including being a parent.",
            "While we do our best to strengthen marriages and families, not all marriages last the distance. But many can be saved and we want to be there to help. In this regard, I am heartened that the Syariah Court's Marriage Counselling Programme (MCP) has been doing good work at facilitating reconciliation between couples.",
            "The MCP is, in fact, over and beyond what the Syariah Court (SYC) is set out to do – to settle divorces amicably and deliver just outcomes. Yet, it reflects the commitment of the SYC, like the rest of our Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs), to improve constantly to serve the needs of our community. Under this programme, SYC has been working with 15 agencies, such as MMOs and Family Service Centres (FSCs), to provide counselling to over 27,000 couples since 2004. More than 40% of these decided to remain married.",
            "The central pillar of the MCP is its committed counsellors, who seek to provide a safe space for couples to discuss marital issues. So, one pioneering counsellor that we see on the screen is Mdm Zaleha Ahmad. She started out as a marriage counsellor to minor couples in 1997, and later joined the MCP when it was launched in 2004. What keeps her high-spirited even after 18 years of counselling is to see couples reconcile and, more importantly, to protect the interests of their children.",
            "Indeed, children were topmost on our minds last year when we announced plans to strengthen protection for children in the divorce process. This was because close to 65% of divorces each year involved couples with children aged 18 years and below. Starting this year, couples with children under 14 years are required to discuss, and subsequently submit, a post-divorce co-parenting and care arrangement plan. This requirement will be extended to couples with children up to 18 years from 2017 onwards. Going forward, SYC will be collaborating with various agencies to provide more social support services and resources for our couples. For example, starting April this year, PPIS As-Salaam Family Support Centre will be conducting briefings at the SYC to help parents understand the impact of divorce on their children, learn cooperative co-parenting skills, and inform them of the national resources available.",
            "One crucial factor for strong, resilient families is prudent financial planning, as highlighted by Mr Zainudin Nordin. This is something that all families must pay careful attention to, because poor budget management can affect everyone in the family. Our marriage preparatory and enrichment courses do cover the importance of financial planning. Mendaki's Programme Bijak Belanja, introduced in 2008, has helped close to 3,000 participants annually on budget management. On downstream measures, AMP's Debt Advisory Centre has been active in providing advice for those in debt. We want to help families more, and we want to start early.",
            "In this regard, Mendaki will be working with our national financial education programme, MoneySENSE, on more upstream measures. This includes expanding Mendaki's Financial Toolkit for Young Couples, to cover more comprehensively topics, such as CPF LIFE and retirement planning, MediShield Life, housing loans and vigilance against scams. They will also provide the MMOs with relevant money management know-how and skills training, so that these organisations can, in turn, better guide their own clients.",
            "Madam, we remain committed to help those who are in need. We will strengthen our social safety nets to help the lower income and vulnerable groups.",
            "Our MMOs are key partners in this endeavour. Many have been tirelessly serving the community for decades and continue to work together with us to ensure that no one gets left behind. Other than the MMOs, our institutions have also grown in their capacity to serve the evolving needs of our community. We have MUIS, which started out as a humble outfit of only seven persons. Today, MUIS has grown to an organisation of over 150 persons, overseeing a range of matters from mosques and",
            "wakafs",
            ", to pilgrimage, halal certification services, religious education and financial assistance. Members may also recall how Mendaki expanded its scope in 1989 to go beyond helping the community in education to include tackling socio-economic issues. SENSE was thus established to serve the community's up-skilling and employment needs.",
            "Madam, the Community Leaders Forum (CLF) was envisioned to rally partners to design and drive innovative programmes to help our community. Recognising the good work of our partners, we launched the $1.2 million Capability Development Fund in April 2014 to better support our MMOs in strengthening governance, enhancing capabilities, and grooming talent. Mr Zainal Sapari asked for examples of the utilisation of this grant. Apart from the two Capability Building Seminars held for our MMOs, five MMOs participated in the CLF's Training Needs Analysis programme to identify areas of improvement. Some have also come forward with their own development plans. Let me cite two examples.",
            "One is PPIS' Project Aura, a research project on issues affecting Muslim women. The aim of this study is to research and develop evidence-based support systems and frameworks to enhance the respective expertise of PPIS' welfare counsellors. PPIS has engaged over 120 female participants from various sectors for their views. In another example, PERGAS is working with the CLF to identify suitable leadership training courses to enhance their organisational capabilities, including in areas, such as strategic planning and governance.",
            "MMOs have also been able to tap on the Malay/Muslim Community Development Fund (MMCDF) to fund their community initiatives. In 2014, we disbursed $4 million for various projects, including AMP's one-stop Debt Advisory Centre, Ain Society's Serenity Family Care programme to help cancer patients, and the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry's ProtÃ©gÃ© Kita mentorship programme for young Malay/Muslim entrepreneurs. So, I look forward to more MMOs tapping on these funds so that the community can be better served.",
            "Mr Zainal Sapari asked about zakat management. Madam, the culture of giving is what makes us strong, and what brings us together as a community. More have started donating electronically, through eNets, AXS, OCBC and CIMB direct credit, and soon they will also be able to give through DBS' ATMs and iBanking. I am proud to share that",
            "zakat",
            "collection increased from almost $22.8 million in 2010 to about $32 million at the end of 2014.",
            "This healthy collection allowed MUIS to not only extend zakat support to more than 5,432 zakat recipients in 2014, but to also enhance our eligibility criteria. As a result, from this year on, the community will be able to help 1,000 more recipients through zakat. As the trusted guardian of community funds, MUIS must be a responsible institution, and must cater for a reasonable reserve to buffer against shortfalls and unforeseen situations. If it does not do so, the needs and well-being of the community would be placed at risk, in particular, in tough times when spare funds are in short supply all around.",
            "Madam, our mosques are our partners in zakat disbursement, and it is through their efforts that we can offer assistance to the needy effectively. Last year, we saw the launch of Nadi Khidmat by Mendaki, MUIS and six mosques, to bring social assistance to the community and to connect them to the wider eco-system of national programmes and agencies, like the FSCs and Social Service Offices. We have received positive feedback from the community, as the centres help streamline the referral process, and also make information on the various community and national assistance schemes more easily available.",
            "I am happy to share with Mr Zainudin Nordin that the centres have been active in building their community networks and bringing on board more partners. For example, at Jamiyah Ar-Rabitah Mosque, the officers work with Syariah Court to ensure that eligible families undergoing divorce proceedings continue to receive Mendaki's social assistance schemes. Meanwhile, at Al Mutaqqin Mosque in Ang Mo Kio, Mendaki worked with Toa Payoh East Citizens' Consultative Committee and Mindchamps Singapore to nominate students for the Mrs Carmee Lim Scholarship, where recipients will be able to attend a range of enrichment programmes under MindChamps.",
            "So, we will continue to enhance the effectiveness of these centres, with a view to expand the service to more locations if necessary. In the meantime, to better reflect the coordinating role of Mendaki, and in recognition of the \"pioneer\" centres in both Pasir Ris and Woodlands, all Nadi Khidmat centres will, henceforth, adopt the \"Mendaki@Heartlands\" brand name.",
            "It is worth noting that other agencies are also leveraging on our mosques to bring their programmes to the ground. This year, NTUC's U Care Centre will pilot an initiative with Al-Mukminin Mosque in Jurong East to reach out to low-wage workers in the neighbourhood on workfare, training schemes and their employment rights. We thank Mr Zainal Sapari for this collaboration.",
            "Madam, our key institutions and partners have done well and we will continue to strengthen partnerships and enhance our service delivery to ensure that deserving individuals get the help they need.",
            "Next, Madam, let me touch on our efforts to nurture a progressive Muslim community. Our mosques are a central focal point in our community's religious life. We are committed to ensure that our mosques provide a safe and nurturing space conducive to worship and religious education.",
            "Mr Hawazi requested an update on the progress of our mosque-building. With the strong support of the community, especially with the inception of the Mosque Building Fund in 1975, MUIS has built 23 new generation mosques and upgraded 39. In just the past six years, nine mosques were upgraded. Five more are in line later this year. With just the MBF alone, we would have added 87,300 prayer spaces by the end of this year. So, I am glad our plans are on track.",
            "Al-Islah mosque in Punggol will be opened in time for residents to celebrate Ramadan and Hari Raya this year. In recent months, we witnessed the ground breaking ceremonies of Maarof mosque in Jurong West and, of course, the Yusof Ishak Mosque in Woodlands as mentioned by Mr Hawazi. I applaud the mosque building committees of Maarof Mosque and Yusof Ishak Mosque for raising approximately $2 million each, and commend the community for their strong support in a very short time. These three mosques will add close to 13,000 prayer spaces nationwide when completed.",
            "But we recognise that some mosques still face overcrowding issues on Fridays. So, to meet strong localised demand in the East, more prayer spaces will be made available from 2015 and beyond. The Al-Ansar Mosque in Bedok is due to be re-opened in April, with a capacity of 4,500 spaces – 1,000 more from the original mosque. We can also look forward to the major upgrading of Darul Ghufran Mosque in Tampines in 2016, with 1,000 more prayer spaces and expanded Islamic learning facilities. At the Al-Istighfar Mosque in Pasir Ris, we will work with our agencies to firm out technical details and intensify what available space that we have. More will be shared in due course. But, meanwhile, with Tampines North being built up as a major residential town, I am pleased to announce that we will also be building a new mosque there. This mosque will also be able to serve new residents in Tampines North and the neighbouring Pasir Ris, as well as industrial estates in both areas. The timing for the mosque's development will be planned to meet both the growth in resident population there and prayer spaces in the area.",

            "Dr Intan asked for an update and future plans for the madrasahs. We have come a long way since 2007 when we first mooted the idea of a single madrasah system for all six madrasahs to consolidate resources, offer an integrated curriculum, and provide educational pathways for our madrasah students. MUIS' commitment to support our madrasahs has been unwavering – for example, MUIS disbursed $194,000 to the six madrasahs from Wakaf Ilmu in 2014, and provided $2.3 million in grants to needy madrasah students through PROMAS between 2010 and 2014. MUIS also supports the madrasahs so that its students can benefit from the Edusave disbursements. The Minister for Education had recently announced that MOE will waive fees for national examinations for Singapore Citizen students in Government-funded schools starting this year, and that the specific respective agencies will consider the treatment for other schools, where necessary. Hence, I would like to share that the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) will assist MUIS so that madrasah students will also not need to pay these fees.",
            "Currently three madrasahs – Irsyad, Aljunied, Arabiah – have come together under a single system. 2015 a key milestone for these three madrasahs, as the first batch of students who have undergone six years of primary education under this system have been posted to Madrasah Aljunied and Madrasah Al-Arabiah following the release of the PSLE results last year. One such student is Sukainah Bte Sulaiman, who scored an aggregate score of 264 for her PSLE and scored straight A*s for the Islamic Studies Placement Examination. Despite being eligible for top national schools, she has chosen to pursue her studies in Madrasah Aljunied. Sukainah is keen to deepen her knowledge in Islamic studies, as she hopes to contribute to the intellectual and spiritual development of the community in the future.

The Ministries and agencies relevant to heritage issues include the Ministry of National Development (MND) with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), NParks, and NEA; the Ministry of Transport with LTA overseeing major infrastructural development; Ministry of Law with the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) as the land owner of sites with heritage value; Ministry of Trade and Industry with Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in-charge of precinct management of Chinatown, Little India; Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth with the National Heritage Board (NHB); Ministry of Communications and Information with the National Library Board (NLB) and National Archives of Singapore (NAS); and finally the Ministry of Finance allocating the budget to the above agencies for heritage work.

HIAs are established processes that seek to evaluate the heritage, historical and cultural value of sites and buildings. They are useful for urban planners, commercial developers, property owners and the state because they involve different stakeholders in the assessment process.

Some estates, like MacPherson, were built early on, and are now quite mature and risk looking worn-out. HDB runs various upgrading programmes to repair and rejuvenate old housing estates, and this has benefitted many residents. For instance, a few days ago, we heard in this House about the Remaking Our Heartlands Programme.",
            "Another example is the current Neighbourhood Renewal Programme which does not adopt a cookie-cutter approach. It does take into account local characteristics and inputs from local (reps). There are also other funds such as CIPC, EUP and WeCare Arts Fund which can be used for community art murals, art installations and others.",
            "However, these are piecemeal schemes each with their respective, separate objectives. Moreover, these are schemes with a prescribed and typically conventional list of improvement items. These are undoubtedly important must-haves, but I think we can go further, especially in this year of SG50.",
            "I believe we can reimagine entire neighbourhoods, while still preserving their defining characteristics and heritage, which remains important as our heritage and our sense of identity are inextricably linked. Such re-imagination should allow for creativity, new energy, co-creation and ownership with residents. Designs should be created in consultation with residents. Old buildings or infrastructure can be re-purposed with a creative twist. Common infrastructure, such as overhead bridges, can be reimagined for new look and use (without having to tear down and be rebuilt). Arts and culture programmes can also be introduced. We could have art installations co-created with the community or organise regular performances, perhaps even have speakers installed along Park Connectors, ABC waterways, to play music to lift the overall feel of the environment. Take for example, those who have walked along the bridge connecting Harbourfront to Sentosa at night can observe and feel the difference. On a normal day, having a place like this provides a temporary escape from the daily grind of working and living in a highly dense and highly urbanised environment. Over weekends, the stretch can be conducive for buskers or live music performances by local talents for youths to gather and enjoy.",
            "Such a wholesale reinvention of a district has been done in other cities, with great success. Take the High Line, for example, in New York City. This park was built on a historic freight rail line. One of the key features is that it is a platform for showcasing artworks. Artists are regularly engaged to think of creative ways to engage with the uniqueness of the architecture, history and design of the High Line and to foster a productive dialogue with the surrounding neighbourhood and urban landscape.",
            "In MacPherson too, we had a project spearheaded by a group of NUS students reading architecture, design and environment, in collaboration with local grassroots organisations. They held mass consultation exercises and design workshops with residents and came up with many interesting and functional designs for existing structures or new ones. Residents were engaged and excited, and were forthcoming with their feedback and suggestions. The works were then compiled into a book titled \"MacPherson: 21st Century Estate\", published in 2011, and many of the works were also put up as mock-ups in a community exhibition. This allowed residents to appreciate the product of their hard work as well as appreciate new possibilities. The entire exercise not only engendered a greater sense of participation amongst residents but also introduced new energy and excitement to an otherwise old neighbourhood.",
            "However, despite the wonderful ideas generated, many could not become reality due to the lack of funding support. Some ideas also straddle the work of many agencies, each with its own funding support rules and designers. We do what we can, for example, by working with community partners to paint wall murals and set up community art galleries to promote community art and beautify the estate. But it is a piecemeal approach, and only for the less costly enhancements.",
            "Hence, I propose to set up a special fund to allow communities of old neighbourhoods to reimagine themselves, and implement these ideas. We can include safeguards on the use of funds, but should encourage the local communities to play an active role and decide what will work for them. In addition to funding support, it is also important that various agencies such as the HDB and LTA are supportive of the effort. This is because some of the works may impact structures under their charge.",
            "I believe reimagining our neighbourhoods is important. It will enable us to redefine how Singaporean neighbourhoods might look and feel like, to the limits of our imagination. A reimagination exercise allows stakeholders, specifically the residents, to have a say in the kind of environment their homes should be like. It also uplifts the spirit of the neighbourhood with a new look, new energy, ownership and pride. It will encourage Singaporeans to help in the upkeep of the neighbourhood, and promote a strong sense of home, community, and ultimately nationhood.",

            ": Madam, finding good, old-school hawker food has become surprisingly difficult over the last 10 years. It is not that the majority of our hawker food tastes terrible. It is that it tastes so average. Most hawkers have already gone down the road of generic pre-made factory food in the name of cost efficiency and productivity. It is an economically understandable but culturally unsatisfying answer to our rising cost and manpower issues. The difference you taste between a hand-crafted curry puff from a hawker stall and a generic one bought in the mall is not just sentiment. It is the difference between mastery and mediocrity. Preserve our hawker heritage and you preserve a cultural touchstone of all our pioneering values – a shared reminder that we are all capable of creating greatness even through simple things and simple circumstances.",
            "I want to focus on three practical things we could do to help protect our hawker heritage. First, provide appropriate representation at state level that specifically looks at protecting heritage and documenting hawker craft. Historically, the main reason why hawker centres fall under the NEA and HDB is because they were just a solution to health and environmental issues or street hawking. But these agencies, by default, will prioritise issues of food safety, environmental health and affordability rather than cultural preservation. Safeguarding our hawker heritage requires cultural, historical and aesthetic distinctions. So would this task fall more appropriately under an agency that already oversees culture and heritage, like the National Heritage Board?",
            "Second, do not make affordability the most significant KPI of hawker centres. Authenticity and excellence of offering have to count too. If we focus on just serving up $2 options, we will inspire more race-to-the-bottom market tactics that you already see happening now: inferior techniques, inferior ingredients, and the prevailing use of pre-mixes. We must not lose the plot of what our hawker centres could be – a showcase to the world, and to ourselves, of our culture at its very best. It is unrealistic to request hawkers to depress their prices to serve customers who can range from low-income to upper-middle class. Those of us who can and already happily paying $6 for sub-standard western seafood pasta in a mall, must learn not to begrudge paying $5 for hand-made fish-ball noodles. Allowing our hawkers to charge realistic prices for their food gives them due honour for their craft and better mitigate rising cost. Affordability of food for the poor may be better solved through a system of food vouchers.",
            "Third, let us accord our master heritage hawkers with national level recognition, tied to both rewards and responsibilities that help solve existing continuity issues. What if we rewarded our selected master hawkers with a kind of Culinary Cultural Medallion? Perhaps, they could have access to a Culinary Cultural Medallion Fund that gives practical support for their continuation of culinary pursuits and compensates them time taken to pass on distinctions of their craft to younger chefs and hawkers. This compliments SkillsFuture's focus on encouraging mastery and mentorship.",
            "How we honour our food artisans matters. The reason why the world reveres Japan's sushi masters as master craftsmen is because Japan respects them so.

Can the Minister update us on the plans to refurbish Esplanade, and beyond that, to keep the Esplanade ahead of the pack as a world-class arts venue?",
            "Aside from the arts infrastructure, there is a need to also develop the arts software. In the face of the homogenising forces of globalisation, it is critical that we build up our heritage resources which differentiate us from other global arts cities.",
            "I urge the Ministry to take a bolder approach to identifying what counts as our national heritage. In Japan, it has a tradition of recognising National Treasures – the highest honour in the folk and traditional arts. Japan also honours masters of traditional art forms such as paper-making and pottery, and a select few are named Living National Treasures. Their mandate is to pass on their craft to the next generation. In this way, Japan ensures that the best of its traditions are preserved and with that, its national identity.",

We should also conserve the unique tools of traditional art forms, such as the last remaining dragon kiln in Singapore, and protect it as part of our heritage.",

Its significance as the premiere performing venue in Singapore is unsurpassed by other newer and more modern purpose-built venues. Personally, I like the preservation of the old seats in the form of an art installation, the new atrium area and the heritage gallery. However, I am disappointed that the capacity of Victoria Theatre has been reduced from 904 to 614.",
            "I understand that this adjustment was necessary for better acoustics. However, this means that we now have a high concentration of venues with capacity of up to about 600. We have the small spaces like The Substation Theatre, Arts House Play Den, SOTA Studio Theatre, Esplanade Recital Studio and Drama Centre Blackbox with about 100-200 seats. Next, Raffles Hotel Jubilee Hall, most theatres in the educational institutes like University Cultural Centre, LaSalle, NAFA and SOTA all have about 300-400 seats each. After that, it is the 600-seaters of Drama Centre Theatre and Victoria Theatre. Beyond that, there is a big jump to the 1,600 at RWS Theatre, which is a commercial and producing, not receiving, theatre; and then to the 2,000 seats at the Esplanade Theatre and MBS Theatre. Of course, the biggest of all is the Star Theatre with 5,000 seats. There is a glaring gap between 600 and 1,600.",
            "This is the range of capacity our local arts groups are most interested in, especially if it is located in the central area. This is because they offer the right combination of scale and intimacy for many productions. When it is too small, the production cost per seat is usually disproportionately much higher, and when it is too big, most local groups do not have the audience to fill the hall. A capacity of about 1,000 to 1,200 will be a good balance.",
            "I would like to ask the Minister if there are any updates on the development of two mid-sized theatres as part of the next phase for development for Esplanade. Since the 2012 report by the Arts and Culture Strategic Review in which the call to build these theatres was made, how much progress has been made in the evaluation?

There are also fortnightly issues of The A List magazine which are distributed free-of-charge island-wide at various locations. This is an excellent way to promote and support the myriad of arts and cultural groups, each of which is too small to publicise on such a scale on their own.",
            "Similarly, I would like to ask the Ministry to consider setting up and funding a framework to provide subsidised common shared facilities for our arts and cultural groups. This could be a panel of professional service providers which are familiar with and passionate about the arts.",

This consolidation of such operations and the pooling of resources will enable our arts and cultural groups to benefit from lower costs and economies of scale. Having access to such professional services will also enable our artists to focus on what they do best, just honing their crafts and delivering the works of inspiration to the public.",
            "I know NAC grants already support expenditure in such areas. However, not all artists and arts groups know where to find good service providers. By ring-fencing specific funds to support the engagement of such services, it would also encourage arts community to pay attention in keeping their finances in order, and raising awareness of their artistic works, in addition to their primary focus on arts creation.

Some of these groups include Tamil and Language, Traditional Arts Centre working with traditional Chinese opera amongst others. Apart from these eight groups, what other new artworks, productions or groups have been added? Tamil and Chinese opera goes down to the heart of our local community. For instance, interest in Chinese opera is waning and it would be good to know how does the funding to these groups benefit and help our local community and draw new interests to these arts?",

Chamber music for example, has been around for more than 200 years and is described as \"music amongst friends\" because it is played in small groups. This would appeal to different segments in our community; some more so than others.

Energetic youths and adults show off their vigour at the street soccer courts and the various hard courts in the estates. Their demonstration of sportsmanship is good inspiration for children and other youths. However, as the population at Yishun grows, the demand for sports facilities has been on the rise. Yishun is a large estate to begin with. Already, applicants are finding it difficult to have access to their favourite venues and sports on a regular basis. Yishun needs more sports facilities, and in greater variety.",

Theatre, dance, and musical groups have to compete for limited venues to practise and hone their crafts. As a supplement to arts housing, I urge the Ministry to consider this request to support our fledging amateur arts community.

You spend time and effort to decorate your home, and when the day arrives, you have a wonderful celebration. When the party is over, you wake up in the morning and you are still the same family living in the same home, with the same responsibilities, the same hopes and anxieties about the future.

In fact, the art extends beyond the gallery because we are having local artists and architects design a new Art Connector to link the Gallery with City Hall MRT Station. So the Connector will include a community mural of self-portraits by Singaporeans. So even walking to the Gallery will be an experience in the arts from the moment you exit the MRT.",

In 1963, as a young man of only about 22 years old, he opened his own furniture factory and he specialises in the repair and restoration of antiques. For this project, Mr Cheng and his workers had to dismantle the buildings' furniture into smaller parts, transport them out, and then carefully work on the furniture with traditional tools. They worked on many interesting pieces, including a table that was specially designed in the 1920s for the former Supreme Court building, which has been used by seven Chief Justices throughout Singapore's history.",

The Museum will be transformed by multimedia experiences, public art and interactive spaces. And the slide shows you a glimpse – a sneak preview – of what you can expect in the National Museum when it re-opens in its full glory in August this year.

This was donated by Mr William Oh, who was among the first cohorts of Singaporeans enlisted into NS.

There will be clear markers to mark out the historic points along the trail, and I hope this can be one of the lasting physical legacies of our Jubilee Year.",

This research will complement the national survey and it will be incorporated into the overall survey. With these findings, NHB will work with URA to enhance heritage considerations at each stage of the planning process, be it in the 10-year Concept Plan or the five-year Master plan.",
            "We will also find creative ways to remember our heritage. Ms Tin Pei Ling talked about allowing old neighbourhoods to re-imagine themselves while preserving their defining heritage. There are already upgrading programmes by MND that deal with the infrastructure. And we can certainly look at how these can be enhanced. What we would like to focus on in MCCY is to enhance the software – to bring arts and heritage programmes to more estates, including old estates.",
            "We will do more to link professional artist and curators with the different communities, and support programmes that bring out the distinct heritage and identity of our neighbourhoods.",
            "To help oversee all of this work, we will form a Heritage Advisory Panel which will include participation from the NGOs and experts across different disciplines. They will guide us in the upcoming heritage survey, research initiatives I talked about and advise us on best practices, including the best practices from other countries and how they can be adapted to our local context.",
            "While the work is on-going, there are certain gems of national heritage that we already know about. And here I would like to update on our national monuments which testify to our diverse communities and our national development.",
            "We have set up the National Monuments Fund to provide funding support to non-profit monument owners for restoration and repair. This Fund has been well received. We will more than double our existing support to about $12 million over the next five years. This includes a new maintenance grant for non-profit monument owners that will alleviate some costs of upkeep, and prevent deterioration to the monuments.",
            "Among our monuments and cherished historic sites and one of the most important is the Singapore Botanic Gardens which we have nominated for inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is not easy to qualify for the UNESCO mark. Nominated sites must prove themselves to be of \"outstanding universal value\", which means they must occupy a unique position not only in the history of the local communities, but of the entire world.",
            "We believe that the Gardens have a solid case. They were instrumental in transforming Southeast Asian history. The most significant example is how research and experimentation conducted at the Gardens introduced rubber to the region, where none had been grown before. And in so doing transform the entire region and indeed the world.",
            "More importantly, our nomination signals our commitment to heritage conservation. We are making a collective stand as a nation to preserve this green oasis in the heart of our city. This will forever be a special place for all Singaporeans, and indeed, for all of humanity. The process for the UNESCO bid is on its way. We will not know the outcome till June or early July. And I will be going to Bonn where the World Heritage Committee meeting will be held and the decision will be made at the Committee. I hope to return after that meeting with Jubilee presents for Singapore and for all Singaporeans.",
            "Besides celebrating our heritage, our Jubilee Year is also a year to celebrate our culture, our distinctly Singaporean culture. As a young multi-cultural nation, this idea of a distinctive Singaporean culture is still relatively new and it is still evolving. Theatre pioneer, Kuo Pao Kun, once said that Singaporeans have the mentality of \"cultural orphans\" – we have a sense of anxiety in the search for self. But he said that many years ago. But over the years, I believe we have strengthened our Singaporean identity. We have forged bonds that bring us together.",
            "Mr Baey Yam Keng and Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin spoke about this. They also spoke about food as an example. We all have fond memories of home-cooked meals and eating out at hawker centres with friends and family. When we go overseas, we miss the food at home. It is an integral part of our identity. I agree with Members that it is important to preserve our food and hawker heritage and we are doing this in various ways.",
            "We are giving more spotlight and recognition to our master hawkers. For many of them, cooking is second nature. They might not have written it down. But it is in their head and they have the skill and craft to cook some of the best food. Take the example of Hainanese chicken rice. If you look at the recipe online or wherever you find it, you will often find the recipe saying: cook the chicken, then soak it in ice water to get the meat tender. That is the common recipe. But in fact the real Hainanese do not soak chicken in ice water. The real Hainanese do not soak the chicken in cold water. It is more difficult to cook that way. It takes more skill. It takes more experience to ensure that you cook it without soaking the chicken in ice water and to ensure that the meat is tender and good to eat.",
            "How do I know this? Because I am a Hainanese, number one. Number two, my grandfather came from Hainan Island many years ago, and he worked as a chef and a steward in a British club. And he was reputedly one of the best cooks there. Unfortunately, the recipe did not pass down to my father who relied mostly on my mum to cook and he certainly did not pass it down to me; which is why we must continue to do more to preserve our food heritage.",
            "We are commissioning research and documentaries for Singaporeans to learn about signature dishes from our master chefs, our master hawkers, and to practise the recipes at home. We will recognise many of these hawkers at the World Street Food Congress that Singapore will host next month.",
            "We are also increasing community outreach on our food heritage. We are incorporating food into the Singapore Heritage Festival and our community trails. In the year ahead, we can look forward to programmes like community cook-out sessions, travelling demonstrations and food carnivals.",
            "Besides food, we are also seeing clearer expressions of what Singapore culture and identity is all about, through the different art forms. For example, when the Singapore Chinese Orchestra performs, they sound very different from a China-based orchestra. You can immediately hear the difference. They have a unique sound, blending traditional Chinese music with Southeast Asian influences.",
            "Likewise in visual art, we have the pioneers of the Nanyang Style, and a younger generation of contemporary artists who are experimenting with different mediums and traditions to bring distinctively Singaporean characteristics to their art. That is why it is so meaningful to celebrate the arts in our Jubilee year. It is about providing meaningful outlets for self-expression and discovery. It is about discovering who we are, and who we want to be.",
            "We will celebrate across different genres of the arts. In the area of dance, for example, NAC will be launching a new nationwide dance carnival in October. It will encompass dance from all our cultural traditions – Chinese, Malay and Indian – as well as newer forms of contemporary dance.",
            "Another example is the Sing50 concert which will be held just before National Day. It will celebrate the rich tapestry of Singapore music, from Pop Yeh Yeh in the 1960s to the",
            "xÄ«nyÃ¡o",
            "movement in the 1980s. We will hear from veterans like Vernon Cornelius from The Quests. Incidentally, they were the only Singapore band that topped the Charts such that they kicked out the Beatles. They were in the Bill Boards and ranked higher than the Beatles in the 1960s. You will hear veterans like Ramli Sarip, Dick Lee, and hopefully we will be able to find Anita Sarawak, whom the organisers have been trying to locate, and have her joined in the concert too.",
            "Our artists not only help us to express our identity, values and beliefs, they also fly our flag overseas. We are supporting them with the $20 million Cultural Diplomacy Fund which we set up last year. This provides our artists with overseas exposure, and also strengthens cultural engagement with other countries.",
            "There are several international highlights on the horizon this year. We will soon launch a Singapore Festival in France – three months' worth of visual arts, theatre and other cultural forms. We are also returning to the Venice Biennale, the pinnacle platform for contemporary visual art. In June, we will participate in the City of London Festival – one of the most highly regarded festivals in the UK. Singapore will be in the spotlight as the featured country at the Festival.",
            "These are not just ad-hoc events or engagements. I agree with Ms Irene Ng that our cultural engagement needs to be done in a systematic manner. As part of our cultural diplomacy efforts, we are working closely with other agencies – including MFA – to build meaningful, strategic and sustained cultural partnerships with these nations. Events like Venice Biennale or SingFrance are part of this larger strategy.",
            "Mdm Chair, the Government is committed to supporting our artists. We will continue to invest in them and the cultural sector. I should say that this is something we should not take for granted. Resources will always be limited and from time to time difficult trade-offs have to be made. You see these in the most advanced economies where budgets for the arts and culture have been cut back sharply in order to meet more pressing demand. We are in a different position fortunately. Our public finances allow us to invest in the art and culture. I am glad that in this House there is strong support for such investments. I am also glad to say that this support is shared by many Singaporeans.",
            "We recently set up a Cultural Matching Fund for the government to match private donations to the arts on a dollar for dollar basis. And in just over a year, we have seen very good response from the public, and the Fund has already disbursed over $30 million to about 60 arts and heritage groups.",
            "Beyond funding, we will continue to support our arts practitioners in other ways. One way suggested by Mr Baey Yam Keng is through the provision of centralised services. And as he noted, NAC already provides some of these services, like shared publicity and marketing. There are also outreach programmes that bring together tenants at our art centres, in Aliwal Art Centre and Goodman Arts Centre.",
            "Going forward, NAC will open its consultancy programmes to more arts organisations. This includes coaching on organisational capabilities, like board management and arts marketing. We will see what else can be done, including the possibility of shared professional services. I also support Mr Baey's suggestion to extend the Dual-Use Scheme to arts groups. And MCCY will work with MOE to see how this can best be implemented.",
            "All in all, we can expect a year-long calendar of very meaningful SG50 activities. It is worth highlighting that many of these activities are driven from the ground-up – they are initiated by ordinary Singaporeans, from all walks of life. So far, through the SG50 Celebration Fund, we have supported around 260 ground-up initiatives; and the number is still rising.",
            "The diverse projects show the strong sense of ownership that our people have in leading the SG50 celebrations, which will strengthen our national identity and community cohesion.",
            "This brings me to what I think is the most important theme for this Jubilee Year, which is our future. We must preserve our heritage, and remember the past. We must celebrate our arts and culture, and strengthen our sense of identity as a people. But most importantly, we must look forward to consider what kind of future we want for Singapore and for the next generation.",
            "Minister of State Sam Tan and Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling will say more about this in their speeches – about how we want to strengthen our spirit of giving, our sense of harmony and our engagement with our youths. And then I will close by talking about sports.",
            "But I would say we particularly recognise that our young people today play a crucial role in shaping our future. We will do everything we can to support them in their aspirations, and to provide opportunities for them to contribute to the community. This is why we started the Youth Corps last year, and we have scaled up programmes at OBS. We are also investing in spaces for youths, for example, by upgrading *SCAPE, and offering more programmes for youth development.",
            "SG50 is naturally a good opportunity for young people to get involved in causes that they care about, and help shape a better society. I am glad that we are already seeing many young people getting involved in SG50 projects.",
            "One example is a young lady named Janet Ng, who is a recent graduate of ITE College West. She is also an active volunteer, who teaches ukulele to the elderly. She was inspired by the Prime Minister's National Day Rally last year, where he spoke about honouring our pioneers. And so a seed of an idea was planted, and it grew bigger over time.",
            "Janet asked herself, \"Why is it that when National Day comes around, some Singaporeans like to go abroad?\" Maybe this question would be asked again this year because it is a long weekend. She thought, \"That's not quite right. I would like to remind people about their identity as Singaporeans, about their roots and their culture. I would like to inspire students to be the pioneers of the next generation.\" She linked up with her schoolmate Sherwin, and they applied for the SG50 Celebration Fund. This July, their team will hold a carnival called \"Evolution to 50\". They hope to re-create Singapore life in the 1970s and 1980s. And they will curate panels that showcase Singapore's development over time. They will invite participants to pen down their aspirations for Singapore's future, and pledge to be the \"Pioneers of the Next Generation.\"",
            "We asked Janet, \"What does that phrase ‘pioneers of the next generation' mean to you?\" And she replied, \"Our pioneers today helped to build up Singapore. So it's our turn to make the change.\"",
            "And there are many young people like Janet who are excited about SG50, and galvanised by that same sense of ownership and possibility. The projects that they are undertaking show that they have got heart and drive for the community. We will continue to engage young people on SG50 throughout this year. We will hear from them directly on their hopes, dreams and ideas for Singapore's future.",
            "This year, the National Youth Council will host a series of youth engagement sessions and conversations. We will invite youths to shape – to share their ideas for a better Singapore – how we can create opportunities for everyone, build a fair and inclusive society, and secure the future of our choice. We will showcase their aspirations at the futuretogether.SG exhibition, which will round off our SG50 celebrations. This will be held at Gardens by the Bay from November, and will continue on through early next year.",
            "I hope many will be inspired by this collective imagining of how we might one day live, work and play in Singapore. I hope that all Singaporeans will be moved to act on these aspirations and build a better future for Singapore.",
            "Mdm Chair, earlier on, I compared what we are doing in SG50 to a family gathering for a celebration. And I think it is appropriate for me to end, for now, by quoting Janet, the ITE graduate I mentioned just now. When we spoke to her about her project, we also asked her, \"What is your wish for SG50?\" She replied, \"That more people will come together and celebrate – not just as individual families, but as one family.\" That is the spirit of SG50.",
            "In our Jubilee Year, I hope we can celebrate our heritage and culture, build a brighter future for all of us to share, and grow closer together as one Singapore family."

            "Mr Arthur Fong has also spoken about the need to preserve our heritage. That is why we will present the stories of our past through our heritage and cultural centres, to better connect Singaporeans to our rich and diverse heritage. This is a reflection of our unique multi-racial and multi-cultural social fabric.",
            "The new Indian Heritage Centre will open in May this year. With its colourful facade, the Centre will be a bright jewel of Little India that tells us the stories of our Indian community.",
            "Within its walls, the history of Singapore's Indian community comes alive. You will trace our Indian pioneers' journey to Singapore. You will see how they helped build our nation through their hard work and grit.",
            "We will also be refreshing the Malay Heritage Centre's permanent galleries, to better tell the stories of our Malay community in Singapore. This includes the Singapore's age-old ties to the Malay world through trade within the Nusantara, or Malay Archipelago.",
            "In addition to the Indian and the Malay Heritage Centres, we can also look forward to the opening of the new Chinese Cultural Centre by the end of next year. The Centre will actively promote both traditional Chinese culture and our modern, uniquely Singaporean version of Chinese culture.",
            "All these heritage and cultural centres are open to Singaporeans of all races, so as to connect us to our roots of our multi-racial multi-cultural society. If we want to know who we are and where we are going to as a people, then we must start with our past, with stories of our separate origins, but also how we came together to build the Singapore of today.",
            "Just as we lived together in the past despite, or because of our diversity, so we need to see how we can continue to make Singapore a welcoming place for people of different cultures and abilities. The second thing we will do in MCCY is to foster an inclusive society through the arts and sports. Mdm Chair, please allow to me to speak in Mandarin for this segment of my speech.",
            "Mdm Chair, a harmonious society needs communication and mutual understanding. Just now Minister talked about how we can promote understanding between different communities through sports and arts. Promoting traditional arts is also an important communication avenue. Traditional arts will not only allow Singaporeans to understand their own background and culture, but also build bridges across cultures, helping to build an inclusive and harmonious society.",
            "There are many cross-culture examples in our life. Take Tan Qinglun from Ding Yi Music Company, for example. Qinglun has been studying the dizi, or Chinese flute, since the age of 12. Three years ago, he challenged himself to learn the Indian flute to increase his understanding of music and traditional Asian culture. He became so good at it that he won second prize in the flute open category of the 2014 National Indian Music Competition. Since then, he has gone on to perform in a sold-out fusion concert, which paired him with an Indian drum player and dancer at the Esplanade last year. The tickets were much sought after.",
            "Qinglun's story is just one example of how different cultures can come together to make art that honours our traditions, while allowing new and beautiful forms to emerge from the cross-pollination of cultures. There are many similar examples like Qinglun in the arts circle.",
            "The Government understands the positive effects brought about by traditional arts, hence we will continue to invest in and support the traditional arts. Mr Baey Yam Keng spoke passionately about this last year. I fully agree with him, and I thank him for continuing to champion the traditional arts. This is also one of the MCCY's main focuses in the future.",
            "In 2010, NAC launched a five-year National Traditional Arts Plan. As a result, NAC's direct funding to traditional arts groups has almost quadrupled, from $1.1 million in 2010 to $4.25 million in 2014. In the next five years, we plan to invest a further $25 million in the traditional arts.",
            "But we will not stop there. In my consultations with traditional arts groups over the last year, one theme has emerged repeatedly, and that is the need for a centre for the traditional arts.",
            "We have heard them. To help traditional arts groups develop further, I am pleased to announce that we will look into developing Stamford Arts Centre at Waterloo Street as a centre with a focus on the Traditional Arts. This is in addition to the new investments MCCY is making in our Heritage Institutions and the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre.",
            "The Government and traditional arts groups need to work together to promote traditional arts. This is because traditional arts is not only our ‘roots' , but also forms a bridge of understanding that connects one culture to the next, uniting us as one people.",
            "Mdm Chair, I would like to continue my speech in English. We will continue also foster inclusiveness through sport. As a legacy of the ASEAN Para Games this year, I agree with Miss Penny Low that we need to ensure that persons with disabilities can participate in sports. And sport is not just meant to be the exclusive domain of the able-bodied. Everyone should be able to participate in sports and have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits that sport brings to them.",
            "I have seen this first-hand, by simulating what it is like to be disabled. If you thought it is hard enough to be disabled, try playing a sport when you cannot walk. I recently played table-tennis sitting down against Dr William Tan. It was much harder than I thought it would be! So, the result was unsurprising – I was beaten flatly and soundly by Dr Tan. After the game, I thought to myself: actually, who is the real disabled one? Certainly, it is not Dr William Tan.",
            "This experience was a humbling reminder that our para athletes are heroes in many ways. Not only do they have to overcome their personal disabilities, they also have to master a difficult game or sport in order to bring glory to Singapore – to our country.",
            "I therefore feel privileged and honoured to have the opportunity of chairing the Committee for Disability Sports, to ensure that we include, not exclude, anyone who wishes to play a sport in Singapore. This means breaking down barriers where they exist, as Miss Penny Low also noted just now in her speech. There could be barriers to information, access to facilities, or even social acceptance.",
            "For example, we will ensure that more of our public sports facilities are disabled-friendly. One such facility that we have set up is the para table tennis training centre at Yishun Sports Centre. We will also look at how we can improve physical access to our facilities, for example, by building more ramps for swimming pools and holding a central stock of specialised equipment that may be required for disability sports. We will continue to work with other disability organisations to see how we can expand disability sports programmes for the wider community of persons with disabilities, so that they have more opportunities to participate in sports, including from a young age, as Mr David Ong has suggested just now.",
            "Inclusiveness also means making Singapore a welcoming home for different faiths and races, as Mr Arthur Fong and Dr Intan have noted. Thus, the third area we will work on is to foster a harmonious society for all. To do this, we have continuous efforts to promote and maintain social harmony. We seek to enhance the common spaces where all Singaporeans can come together.",
            "Members would have been very familiar with our Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles, which promote dialogue and foster friendships across faiths and ethnicities. Mr Arthur Fong asked what the Government has done to support community efforts aimed at fostering communal understanding.",
            "Mdm Chair, we should continue with all the efforts to maintain racial and religious harmony. However, Government should not and cannot be doing this alone. Everyone has a part to play in building Singapore's harmony. But the Government can take the lead in this effort.",
            "This is why we started the Harmony Fund in 2013, to support projects that promote racial and religious harmony in Singapore. Two years later, we have supported 55 projects, and committed a total funding of close to $1.8 million.",
            "One on-going project is Paths, started by four passionate NTU students. They realised that most young people in Singapore know very little about the different religions here, even though we are so religiously diverse. They felt it was important to go beyond what they call the \"three Fs\" which are often regarded as our common heritage. The three Fs are food, fashion and festival.",
            "The students started to research, and compile the stories of Singaporeans who belong to different faith and religion. For example, through the efforts of these four students, we learn the Taoist talismans have to be written within one breath – you cannot stop. The moment you stop, the magical power is gone. You have to write Taoist talismans in one breath. We also learn that Muslims deliver the",
            "Salam",
            "– a greeting of peace – at the end of each prayer set. We also learn that Hindu devotees spend 48 days preparing to bear the",
            "kavadi",
            ", by praying, fasting, and even sleeping on the floor instead of a bed.",
            "Specific rituals aside, the stories all point to the oneness and interconnectedness of our diverse belief systems – that at the heart of each faith is the search to be a better person.",
            "Mdm Chair, MCCY recognises that we are a nation of diverse people, each with our own cultures and stories. That we are different is a fact. That we stay united is a choice.",
            "In 2015, as our nation turns 50, our mission is simple – to build a strong, diverse communities of friends and families, rooted in our Singaporean-ness. I would liken this to our hands that without any of our fingers, it will be difficult to perform its tasks. We will work, play and live together like the fingers on our hands, because to do otherwise is to disown a part of ourselves.",
            "And that is the future we will work towards – a nation united by things that bind us, and a keen appreciation of what makes us uniquely different."

And, like what Mr Seah Kian Peng has mentioned earlier, giving is not just about making donation. It is also about giving our time, our efforts and also our skills and our competency. Giving enriches our lives with purpose and perspective. As a Chinese saying goes, “施比受更有福”. Generally it means it is most blessed to give than to receive.",

Her passion for helping those with learning difficulties motivated her to volunteer with Youth Corps Singapore. As a teacher of students with ASD, Hui Yee is in a job that is both rewarding and challenging. Yet, Hui Yee has also chosen to devote her free time to help out at an adult day activity centre for the intellectually challenged.",

And, over a couple of months, this mechanism helped everyone, the clients as well as the centre staff, better understand each other and communicate better, such that the client has enough courage to venture out of the centre and interact with the community.",
            "Youth Corps Singapore is about bringing together passionate individuals like Hui Yee to benefit the community. Even though each aspiring Youth Corps member has many commitments to juggle, be it work, study, family and even marriage, what unites and motivates each and every one of them is their desire to be part of the change they wish to see in our nation. At MCCY, we are very heartened by their passion and the way they are impacting our society, our Singapore.",
            "Indeed, with this new platform to do good, The Youth Corps Singapore is sowing seeds of service doing the most formative years of life. These seeds could germinate into a lifelong journey of service and giving sets us apart as a giving nation.",
            "Mr Alex Yam earlier asked how we intend to enhance youth space to better support our youth's aspirations. Through a consultation exercise that stretched from October to December 2014 that involved more than 1,000 youths, the youths indicated most interest in music and dance. To better support youth interest in this area, we shall be revamping *SCAPE in the coming year. The physical space at *SCAPE will be refreshed. There will be more space and better equipment for our young Singaporeans to hone and display their talent. For example, we envisage an alfresco bandstand where young musicians can regularly perform in front of their peers.",
            "Programmes at the *SCAPE will be organised by our youth for the youth. *SCAPE will further spotlight our youth talents by hosting events like the inaugural National Youth Film Awards, the YouTube FanFest, and the 10th edition of the Shine Festival. *SCAPE will connect young musicians like \"The Sam Willows\" and the Gentle Bones\" to the wider youth audience through school performances with the *SCAPE Invasion tour.",
            "To inspire our youth to help the less fortunate in their backyard, *SCAPE will expand its community specific programmes and community trails at different neighbourhood.",
            "Next, our young working adults are also getting into the spirit of giving. I will give an example. Take the \"50 for 50\" ground-up initiative – it is one good example. In fact, I was just at their closing ceremony in early February where I witnessed for myself the positive energy that the 50 young working adults generated alongside their corporate donors, the VWOs as well as the beneficiaries.",
            "This initiative brought together 50 young adults to partner with companies like UOB, the Banyan Tree to fund raise for 50 worthy community and social causes. One of the\"50 for 50\" participant is this gentleman, Mr Jesher Loi, who is a Board Member of *SCAPE and also the Director of Branding and Market Development at Ya Kun International. Not only did he rally many business owners to contribute to his cause, he also got his company Ya Kun to pitch in by donating 50 cents to charity for every Christmas Frostyz drink that is sold during the Christmas season.",
            "Companies like Ya Kun see themselves as part of a building nation. They recognise the role businesses can play in building the community with their contributions. Corporate giving strengthens our society. Companies in Singapore have indeed been responding to the evolving community needs. For the past 10 years, gross donations by companies to Institutions of Public Character have doubled between 2004 and 2013.",
            "To step up corporate giving, we hope to see many more companies not only donating, but also rallying and also enabling their staff to contribute their time, their skills, their talent, their competencies. Like what Mr Seah Kian Peng has mentioned, companies have an enormous influence in nurturing the culture of giving in our working adults.",
            "Mr Seah spoke passionately about urging the top leadership of companies to drive giving efforts, and we agree with him. This is indeed what our partner, the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre or NVPC, aims to do. NVPC is engaging C-Suite executives so as to broker partnerships amongst like-minded corporate leaders and match the companies to charitable causes. It is also developing a Singapore Roadmap for Corporate Giving, which will guide companies in their journey of giving back and as well as recognising some of the best practices.",
            "I talked to the NVPC colleagues and they shared with me what they aspire to do is for each and every company in Singapore, over time, to make \"goodness the business of every organisation\". That is the aspiration. An example of one such company is Changi Airport Group (CAG) that is trying to make goodness part of its business.",
            "CAG had partnered Northlight School through SportCares, a SportSG programme that links those in need with volunteers and donors through sports programmes and life-skills workshops. CAG fully funded Northlight School's participation in a football programme called Saturday Night Lights. In addition, its employees volunteer as trainers and mentors in the programme. Every Saturday Night is a time where the CAG staff and the Northlight students look forward to. SportCares has touched the lives of more than 5,000 students and youths over the past three years through such corporate partnership.",
            "One such youth whose life was touched and changed is 13-year-old Zul. Last year, Zul thought that his dream of becoming a competitive runner was really over when his school changed its focus from running to football. He took out his frustrations on his parents and back then, fell in with bad company. His father, an ambulance driver was really at his wits' end. Then he read about SportCares, CareRunners, he put Zul under the SportCares programme and soon, Zul was training with CareRunners under the guidance of national coach, Elangovan.",
            "Elangovan immediately recognised Zul's running potential and begin developing Zul in sprints and middle distances. In less than three months, Zul won his first ever race in 800 m event of the Akira Swift Championship with the time of 2 minutes and 19 seconds.",
            "Zul caught the attention of the Singapore Sports School and in January this year, he earned a coveted place there. We are all very happy for him. The story does not end there. Zul is now a volunteer at the 28th SEA Games. Just last Saturday, Zul and his sister helped out at our 90-day countdown to the Sea Games. As you can see, it is really wonderful how Zul is giving back to society because he has experienced first-hand how SportsCare has made a difference in his life over the course of one year.",
            "Besides NVPC and SportCares, the Community Development Council (CDCs), are also actively promoting a culture of giving back. Earlier, Mr Patrick Tay had asked about the role of the CDCs.",
            "In 2014, the CDCs worked with more than 500 companies that gave back to their communities. For example, the Southwest CDC has joined hands with many civic-minded companies in partnership with the VWO in the district to help the less fortunate.",
            "One example is Amos International, a logistic firm in Southwest. They volunteered in food deliveries and outings for less privileged children. Since 2010, it has reached out to more than six hundred people. Now, switching attention back to individual, one is never too old to volunteer. And I can give Members a very interesting example.",
            "Let me share very briefly the story of Mr and Mrs Pang – our Pioneer Generation. Mr and Mrs Pang have been married for 50 years. Yes – they got married in 1965. They ran a provision shop together. And now, their partnership at work has evolved into a partnership of volunteerism at O'Joy Care Services, an Eldercare Service Centre.",
            "Mr and Mrs Pang head to this centre four days a week, for three hours each time and help out in exercise and drama activities for the elderly. They also manage the logistics of these activities with the managerial skills that they have gained from running their provision shop. At MCCY, we hope that there will be more volunteers like Mr and Mrs Pang as we create volunteer opportunities that are attuned to our seniors' motivations, our seniors' strengthens and also our seniors' interest.",
            "Our seniors have a lifetime of skills. In Mandarin we say, “人生经验”. They have a lifetime of skills and experience to contribute to our society. Our seniors, they can also benefit from volunteering. In fact, studies have shown a positive association between volunteering and both mental and physical well-being.",
            "To find out how to better encouraged and support our seniors in their interest to volunteer, we have sought the feedback and views of over 100 senior volunteers. The key motivating factors, we realised, of volunteering, were related to: (i) desire to learn new skills; (ii) their desire to set a positive example for the younger generation; and (iii) to escape from boredom at home.",
            "Some of the challenges that they face were getting a good match between the skills that they have and the volunteer host organisations that is needed. Family and personal commitments as well as health, and the ease of accessibility to the locations where their help was needed were also factors that also influence their volunteering decisions. We can well understand that.",
            "The feedback helped MCCY and Southwest CDC to pilot the design of a pipeline of initiatives to engage senior volunteers in Southwest District. These include matching volunteers with the needs of the local community, and a training grant for senior volunteers.",
            "Now, on this note, let me wrap up with a very interesting story of an 87-year-old volunteer, Mr Wee Char Lee. Mr Wee is a father of three and a grandfather of six. He was a cash register technician for forty years before retiring in 1987. As a youth during World War II, he was an air observer volunteer. His job back then was to patrol the streets at night and look out for bombers. Whenever he saw any bombers, his job was to run and warn everyone else to shut off the lights to avoid detection. A very important job.",
            "More than 70 years later, Mr Wee is still volunteering. Kudos to him! Two or three times a week, Mr Wee lends a listening ear to seniors at the Presbyterian Community Services. As Members can see, giving back is really part of Mr Wee's DNA. We asked him and he said that, \"I find it satisfying to be able to help others in need, and to see other people happy. If I do not do this work, I would be bored.\"",
            "Like what Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister of State Sam Tan have mentioned, this year, as we celebrate SG50, many Singaporeans have expressed the hope that giving will increasingly be part of our national identity. Giving will become our way of life. If we continue to nurture a culture of giving from the young to the old at every stage of our lives with every opportunity, we can certainly make giving part of Singapore's DNA. On this note, we hope everyone in the House will join us all in realising this vision of Singapore as a Giving Nation."

            ": Over the years, we have continuously invested in sports. We have worked hard to increase accessibility and opportunities for Singaporeans to participate in sports. This is because there is nothing like sports that can excite people, and bring us together. Our efforts have yielded results. The weekly sports participation rate has increased from 42% in 2011 to above 60%.",
            "The opening of the Sports Hub last year has been an additional catalyst to developing our sporting scene. Our athletes now have world-class facilities to train and compete in. Singaporeans too benefit from these facilities. Every day, the indoor halls at the Sports Hub would be packed with people playing badminton, basketball, netball, volleyball and table tennis. Some community groups have also become a regular sight at the Sports Hub, such as the Shin Zhong Taiji Quan Association, which organises its weekly Taiji sessions at the Sports Hub.",
            "Last year, there were more than 60 sports events held at the Sports Hub, with attendances of nearly a quarter million across all the sports venues. This year, we will see an even more vibrant calendar of sporting events.",
            "But the key highlights of the year will be the 28th SEA Games in June and the 8th ASEAN Para Games in December. This is the first time we are hosting the SEA Games after 22 long years, and the very first time ever that we are hosting the ASEAN Para Games. These are two excellent opportunities for all of us to rally together, to put up a good show, and to cheer for our athletes.",
            "We will field the largest ever Team Singapore contingent in the history of both Games. We are looking at close to 700 athletes for the SEA Games and 100 para athletes for the ASEAN Para Games. Our athletes are not new to major competitions, but this year, the competition will be something special for all of them, because they are competing in front of home crowd and they are bringing glory to Singapore, right here in Singapore.",
            "This is why they are going all out, making tremendous sacrifices, and putting extra effort into their training. Amongst them is 28-year-old cyclist, Dinah Chan. She participated in the last SEA Games in Myanmar and three months before her race, her plans were thrown into disarray because of a car accident. But Dinah bounced back into training within four days of the accident, and she eventually won Singapore's first cycling SEA Games Gold Medal in over 16 years. Till today, whenever she hears the national anthem being played out during her school's assembly session, because she is a teacher, she said that she would always remember what it was like to be able to stand on the podium in Myanmar and she hopes to do so again in Singapore.",
            "The same can be said of our para athletes, whose stories truly reflect the triumph of the human spirit. Some of you may be familiar with para sailor Jovin Tan, who is a three-time paralympian. Born with cerebral palsy, he picked up sailing at the age of 15. Even though he cannot swim; he picked up sailing. He used to require assistance to get in and out of his boat. But during the training session, with the help of his coach, he learnt how to crawl from his wheelchair onto his boat all by himself, so that he can be fully independent and he would not need to rely on volunteers. It may seem like a very small thing. This is not about the race; it is really about getting from the wheelchair to the boat. But it shows the tremendous resilience and spirit that our athletes have, and wanting to be able to excel at what they do. That is why Jovin is also training very hard for the upcoming ASEAN Para Games in December.",
            "Just as athletes are raising their games, Sport Singapore is also doing everything it can to support them. Take archer Tan Si Lie, for example. He's a student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), but has taken time off to train full-time for the SEA Games. We are providing him with enhanced training assistance grants to support his full-time training load, and also additional programme support for his overseas competitions.",
            "This has allowed him to train freely without worrying about the cost of these overseas trips and also his archery equipment. He is not the only one enjoying such support. Altogether, we have close to 400 athletes on what we call the Final Push Programme – to provide additional resources and support to our athletes, so that they can focus on their preparations for the Games.",
            "The Government is doing its utmost to support our athletes. In fact, if you speak to some of our veteran sport administrators, they will tell you that this is the most comprehensive preparations that we have done so far for a major Games. But the biggest support and motivation that our athletes can get is from Singaporeans directly. I join Members like Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Arthur Fong in calling on Singaporeans to rally together and get behind our athletes.",
            "There are many ways to show support. The first of course is to come for the Games. Make sure you attend and cheer for our athletes during the competitions. This is why we have ensured that half of the events at the SEA Games are free, and the prices for the ticketed events are kept affordable – as low as $5, with additional concession for students, senior citizens and full-time National Servicemen.",
            "We have also reached out to friends and family members of Team Singapore athletes, who will also be able to purchase discounted tickets through their respective National Sports Associations. I am happy to report that the tickets sales so far have been progressing well and I would urge everyone to get their tickets soon because they may well be sold out before too long. I also want to call on employers, be it in the public or private sectors. Employers, please grant your staff time-off to attend the Games, so that you can show your support too.",
            "In the words of our national sprinter Calvin Kang, \"Support from Singaporeans is important, because this is home, and home is where the heart belongs.\" So the Games will be a rare opportunity for Singaporeans to come together and show that we are part of one team Singapore. And I would call on everyone to show their support wholeheartedly.",
            "We had a glimpse of what it means to have such strong home ground support last weekend when 40,000 people came together to mark the 90-day countdown to the SEA Games and we unfurled the largest ever team Singapore flag on Orchard Road.",
            "Our SEA Games merchandise store has also been well received. It is very popular. The items, more importantly – have been created with a social cause as was suggested by Miss Penny Low. Amongst them are acrylic paintings and tote bags produced and packaged by trainees from the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) and the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) respectively. And there also Braille gel bracelets produced to help raise awareness for the visually-impaired. And I am glad to say that part of the sale proceeds will go to the SportCares Foundation and",
            "The Straits Times",
            "Pocket Money Fund. So, they will be supporting a good cause.",
            "Over the coming weeks, we will be stepping up our engagement activities all over Singapore. We will dress up our housing estates and key buildings with Team Singapore banners. The Games torch will be travelling to the communities and schools as part of our engagement effort to create even more awareness and excitement.",
            "One activity which has proven to be quite popular is the Make-a-NILA initiative. NILA is the mascot for the Games and in every Games, there will be a mascot and the podium finishers will get a stuffed toy representing the mascot.",
            "Usually they are factory produced in all the Games that we have seen. But in the SEA Games, we decided to do something special because these mascots are personally sewn by Singaporeans and these hand-made NILAs, together with personalised messages of well wishes, will then be presented to the winning athletes. That is the activity that you can engage in the community and it has been very popular.",
            "In all our engagements, we also aim to link our athletes closer with the schools and communities they come from, in order to strengthen that sense of connection with our athletes. When Singaporeans cheer for a Team Singapore athlete, it is not someone distant that they read about in the newspapers or watch on TV, but it will be a person they can all connect with – someone who has gone to the same school as us, or someone who lives with us in our neighbourhoods.",
            "In short, we are celebrating our own hometown sporting heroes. Let us say you are living in Marine Parade, you may soon see billboards like this, the one you see on screen here showing support, basically saying \"Marine Parade Cheers for our Hometown Sporting Heroes\" and showing support for Team Singapore athletes in the same estate, like swimmer Joseph Schooling and sailor Jodie Lai. We are doing this in all our HDB estates and HDB towns.",
            "We hope Singaporeans will join us in all of these activities. Some may wish to do more, and have done so. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of our volunteers, whom we call Team Nila. We started this call for volunteers two years ago, and the response has been overwhelming. It has far exceeded our targets. We now have about 17,000 volunteers for the SEA Games and 6,000 performers for the Opening Ceremony of the Games. They come from all walks of life, and they are committed to giving their time, energy and passion for a successful Games.",
            "One of the volunteers is Mr Tang Chun Tuck. In fact, you know, he is one of the rare volunteers who has been involved in all the editions of the Games hosted in Singapore – 1973, 1983, 1993 and now this year. He was a first-aider at the 1973 and 1983 Games. He helped to coordinate the work of the Red Cross in 1993. And this year, instead of donning his Red Cross uniform, he has decided to take on the role of a media relations officer, putting the skills he has honed in over 30 years with the civil service to good use. And I can attest to the skills that he has because in fact I met him when I was a very young officer working in the Ministry of Finance. He was my colleague and I think he would certainly make a lot of contributions to the Games. With the dedication and passion of volunteers like him, I am confident that we can ensure a positive experience for all Singaporeans and for our friends from the region.",
            "Mdm Chair, the SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games will no doubt be the highlight of our sporting calendar this year. But at the end of the day, when the crowds leave and when we bid farewell to our regional neighbours, it is what we leave behind that matters more.",
            "What is the legacy that we want to leave behind? One important legacy is to further strengthen the culture of sports among Singaporeans. I am sure the SEA Games will spark interest in sports – we will have more people coming to cheer for Team Singapore, more students and volunteers getting involved, and more people participating in sports.",
            "But all this should not just be a short-lived temporary phenomenon. How do we sustain the momentum? I think the best way is to step up our initiatives and programmes under ActiveSG.",
            "We started ActiveSG as our national movement for sports. We provided a $100 credit to all new members. So far, more than 700,000 have signed up for ActiveSG. About three in five members have used their free credits to book facilities and join sports programmes.",
            "Through ActiveSG, we have enhanced our sports facilities and introduced new and innovative programmes at our sports centres. Utilisation rates at our gyms, our pools and our sports halls have increased by about 30%. It is encouraging to see not just existing members but also new converts to sports.",
            "Take the example of Mr Sujimy Mohd and his family. Like many Singaporeans, their typical weekends would be spent on watching movies, going out to eat, or shopping in a mall. That is before ActiveSG. As he puts it, \"In Singapore, it's very easy to just go out and 'makan', or check out the latest mall. You need to consciously tell yourself that you need to do something different\".",
            "Now, with the improvements we have made through ActiveSG, Mr Sujimy and his wife bring their children to the Jurong West swimming complex every weekend, and they are enjoying a more active, healthier and, may I say, happier, lifestyle.",
            "Mr David Ong asked how ActiveSG can complement the school sports ecosystem to nurture the sporting habit from young. This is indeed a key area of focus for us in the coming year.",
            "ActiveSG's partnership with schools involves programming at several levels. First, we will continue to ramp up our School Holiday Sports Programme. These holiday sessions expose students to a variety of new sports, like archery, floorball, futsal, inline skating and ultimate frisbee. When we first piloted this programme, we were not sure about the response, especially for sessions in the September holidays when it was close to the year-end examinations. But we were pleasantly surprised because many of these programmes ended up being over-subscribed, not just by children, but also by their parents who participated alongside their kids. We will build on this, and also the strong interest among the schools that are partnering us for the SEA Games, to roll out even more programmes in the coming year.",
            "ActiveSG also works closely with some schools to broaden the opportunities for their students to participate in sports. You hear feedback from time to time that students do not get a chance to play sports in school unless they make it to the school team. I should say that this is not new because even when I was in Primary school in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I remember I wanted to play football, but I was not good enough to make it to the school team, so I could not join the CCA, or then they call it the ECA.",
            "Our schools are better equipped today, but I can appreciate that it is not always easy for them to accommodate every request for involvement in sports. What we are doing in ActiveSG is to complement the school offerings and provide even more opportunities for young people to get involved in sports. For example, in Serangoon Secondary School, with the support of ActiveSG, students now have a chance to play floorball, even though it is not offered as a CCA.",
            "At Cedar Girls' Secondary, the athletics team now uses the training facility at the Kallang Practice Track. So with the support of ActiveSG, we provide coaching expertise and programming assistance to the school and in such a way that students who are not part of the school athletics team can now also participate in track and field activities.",
            "ActiveSG will also look at starting more competitive leagues among the schools. For example, we recently partnered the Basketball Association of Singapore (BAS) to organise a developmental league. This was for the teams that did not qualify for the National Round of the B Division Inter-School Basketball Championships. Each team could also field more players than usual. They can field up to 15 instead of 12. So again those who do not make it to the school team now get a chance to play and they can compete with one another at about the same skill level.",
            "That is what we are trying to achieve through ActiveSG – to provide maximum opportunities for our youths to participate in sports, and so that we start this from young and they can develop a lifelong interest in sports.",
            "Besides better programming, we are also improving our infrastructure under the Sports Facilities Master Plan and several Members, like Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Arthur Fong asked about this. As Members are aware, we have started work on several major projects in the Master Plan – the Regional Sports Centre in Tampines and Punggol, as well as the new sports centre in Sembawang, and the redevelopment of the Ang Mo Kio Swimming Complex.",
            "There are other developments in the pipeline. These will be done at a later phase, probably after 2020. This is part of a broader phasing of public sector infrastructure projects due to the constraints we face, especially in terms of foreign workers. But in the interim, before the new centres are ready, we will step up our programming efforts in these areas and we will do that in Yishun and other estates as well.",
            "Our investments in new sports facilities are also necessary for another important goal, which is to break down the barriers that often prevent people with disabilities from participating in sports. Minister of State Sam Tan spoke about this just now. And as highlighted by Miss Penny Low, the ASEAN Para Games offers us a very good opportunity for us to leave behind a real legacy for participation in disability sport in Singapore.",
            "That is why we formed the Committee for Disability Sports which is chaired by Minister of State Sam Tan, which will tackle the longer term issues needed to raise participation in disability sports and for more people to get involved. We want sports to be inclusive, so that all Singaporeans can experience the benefits of an active and healthy lifestyle.",
            "Another legacy for the Games is to have a robust High Performance Sports (HPS) system to support the aspirations of our sporting talents, and several Members spoke about this as well. We are doing a lot to prepare our athletes for this year's Games. But again it should not be once-off and it is not just because we are the host this year. Our investments in High Performance Sports also will be sustained – they are part of a broader plan to systematically build up and strengthen our sporting system.",
            "For example, we have a spexScholarship scheme where athletes with the potential to excel at the Asian Games, World Championships or Olympic Games level can enjoy significant financial and programming support.",
            "Fencer Lim Wei Wen is one such athlete who is now benefiting from the scheme. He had difficult family circumstances and was raised by his grandparents. He took to fencing in ITE, but almost had to give it up when he needed to find a job to support the family. But when the Singapore Fencing Association heard about the new scholarship scheme, they put his name up, and he qualified and received the award in 2013. Since then, he has gone on to win Singapore's first ever fencing medal at the recent Incheon Asian Games. This is not just South East Asia, it is at the Asian level he has medalled and he is aiming even higher.",
            "We now have 70 top athletes who are focusing on full-time training with support under the spexScholarship. After the SEA Games and Para Games, if there are more athletes who demonstrate excellent performance and wish to go on to higher levels, the support will be there for them.",
            "Our high performance sports system will also support male athletes with National Service obligations. We will help them secure time-off to train and represent Singapore at major games. We will support and track those with exceptional talent. And if they meet the performance benchmarks, which means having the potential to medal at top-level international sports competitions like the Olympic Games, we will support them in their application for deferment from full-time National Service.",
            "Besides supporting our top performing athletes, we are also engaging our various stakeholders, including the National Sports Associations (NSAs), employers and schools. We have moved our NSAs to a baseline block funding approach, so that they can have more certainty to plan for multi-years. This fiscal year, almost all NSAs will get a higher baseline funding. NSAs can tap on flexible programme funding to develop new initiatives and focus areas. These could include training and competitions locally and abroad with sporting clubs. Overall, funding for NSAs will increase by close to 10% in Fiscal Year 2015 compared to the previous year.",
            "The Football Association of Singapore (FAS) is one such NSA that would benefit from all the investments that we are putting in. I think Mr Faisal Manap asked about this. There is a task force that is looking at setting out the goals and the strategic directions for the Singapore Football in the coming years. They are hard at work and I would say that their initial thinking is very much in line with what some of the suggestions that were raised by the Member which is to focus on youth development. They will be sharing the task force's recommendations very soon in the coming months.",
            "To help athletes balance their pursuit of High Performance Sports with their career aspirations, we have also introduced a new spexCareer Scheme.",
            "Under this scheme, we have 21 partner companies. They are committed to emplacing athletes on internships, apprenticeships, part-time or full-time employment and that is because they see the value of employing an athlete. They feel that an athlete embodies the winning spirit, embodies the right values of teamwork and resilience and they want to employ and recruit athletes.",
            "For example, part-time Judo coach and athlete Ang Xuan Yi is one who has benefited because through the matching and through this new scheme, we have helped her to land a full-time position with Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group (MSIG). And this insurance company has agreed to hold the place for her so that she can train for the SEA Games, and have even offered an opportunity for her to head to their Japan head office's Judo Training Centre for an exchange programme. These are companies we have in our network and we will grow the network so that we can offer more such opportunities for our athletes.",
            "Madam, the Government alone cannot ensure the viability of a career in sports. This remains a personal decision and commitment that an individual has to make. But what we have done and will continue to do is to put in place a support system for those with sporting aspirations and the desire to fully realise their potential.",
            "To further strengthen this ecosystem, we have also set up a committee to review the Singapore Sports School. The Committee has been seeking inputs from various groups and studying the approaches and models in other countries. One area that they are studying is how to extend the development pathway for student athletes, so that they can continue to benefit from a supportive environment that would enable them to study, train and develop as an athlete, beyond their Secondary school years. These post-Secondary years are particularly crucial because athlete development often spans late adolescence and early adulthood.",
            "One idea is for the Sports School to offer predominantly six plus years through-train programmes within the school, and also with stronger linkages with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), including local and overseas universities so that there will be a wider range of athlete-friendly post-Secondary pathways. The Committee will be finalising its report after further consultation and the full report will be released later this year.",
            "Mdm Chair, in conclusion, there are few things in life that rally our emotions and fire up the Singapore spirit like sports. And there has never been a better opportunity for Singaporeans to come together. As I have said, it is the first time in 22 years that we are hosting the SEA Games, but this is the only time that you will have the SEA Games together with the 50th Birthday of Singapore. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.",
            "The last time we hosted the SEA Games in 1993, we saw sporting heroes like Joscelin Yeo, Fandi Ahmad in action. We saw bowler Grace Young who, some of you may remember, was the one who lit the cauldron during the Games. Grace also won a gold medal in the women's bowling doubles event, and we met her recently and she said, \"That medal – that gold medal – was not just for me, my team or my federation. That medal was also for the retired uncle who bowled just a few lanes away when I was training; it was for the cleaning lady who stood behind smiling every time I looked up from my routine; it was for the taxi driver who asked me for tips on what wrist guard was best for him. That medal was for every Singaporean.\"",
            "When the SEA Games comes in June and the ASEAN Para Games in December, the spotlight is not just on our athletes; it will be on all of us coming together as One Team Singapore. So, let us all do our part to celebrate this sporting milestone, and make our Golden Jubilee a truly meaningful and exciting one.",

We will explore ways to develop the Stamford Art Centre into a centre with a focus on the traditional arts.",

            "Secondly, in terms of software, we will also help the groups become professionalised, help them develop their capabilities, so that they can create new content and productions.",
            "Thirdly, we will continue to provide funding for these traditional art groups to promote traditional arts through different platforms. For example, we strongly encourage and support them in organising national competitions like the National Chinese Music Competition and Indian Music Competition.",
            "Fourthly, through NAC's Artist-in-School Scheme, we also promote traditional arts in schools, so that students are exposed to traditional arts from young; they may become interested and eventually become part of the traditional arts scene or an audience member.",
            "Lastly, in order to better develop our traditional arts scene, we will focus on training and preserving traditional art forms. In the next few years, NAC will launch a scheme to encourage the traditional arts groups to document their history, knowledge and stories, so that their traditional art form can be preserved through text, images and records.",

Can I ask the Minister what is the outcome of the study because the last time he said that he would study the proposal of building a velodrome seriously? That is first.",

That timeline has passed; can I ask the Minister when will he be ready to announce the venue of the replacement site and plans for it?",

I mentioned in my speech, the Japan's tradition of honouring national treasures and also individuals who have mastered their craft and calling them \"living national treasures\". Several countries have adopted that scheme, the United States, South Korea, France and Australia. I would urge the Minister to explore whether Singapore should also adopt a similar scheme to make sure that the best of our local traditions are preserved and passed on to the next generation."

We are not ready yet but the study is still underway and we are looking at possible locations and the feasibility of it.",

We already have many schemes that do that in Singapore today through the NAC schemes where we honour our master craftsmen and our master artists, and we will see what more we can do to enhance these recognition of such individuals."

It indeed cuts across many agencies as Prof Tan Tai Yong mentioned just now. He talked about all the different agencies that are involved in heritage. And that is to be expected because no single agency can own heritage. It is part of all of us. The National Heritage Board will be the champion for heritage and they will promote heritage in all the different aspects, including in Haw Par Villa, but there may be different lead agencies in charge of some of these projects because they fall under different ambits and there are different agencies pushing them.",

            "Over the past few years, the Ministry of Health has made significant steps to fine-tune the service delivery and financing framework for healthcare in Singapore. Primary healthcare flexibility and financing have been significantly improved through various schemes, such as the Community Health Assistance Scheme (CHAS), the Pioneer Generation package and, more recently, Flexi-Medisave.",
            "Infrastructure as well has been improved with initiatives, such as Family Medicine Clinics and Community Health Centres. The capacity and capability of our hospitals have also been steadily improving, reducing concerns about the bed crunch, with more acute and community hospitals coming on line in the near future. Nursing home capacity and quality have also been resolutely raised over the past few years, and we look forward to the formal roll-out of MediShield Life next year.",
            "This grand vision of the direction in which healthcare in Singapore is heading was outlined a few years ago under Healthcare Vision 2020 Master Plan. If I may be so bold, I would like to first ask the Minister to share with this House his vision for healthcare in Singapore beyond 2020.",
            "Beyond lingering concerns about how we can continue to afford and sustain healthcare spending, and in spite of what has been achieved thus far, I see three key challenges in the decade ahead and beyond.",
            "The first challenge is how to empower and encourage our citizens to live healthier and to live better. We all recognise the importance of keeping healthy and disease prevention, but walking the walk is far more difficult than talking the talk. How do we get our people to make healthy life choices?",
            "The Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Health believes that the approach should be multipronged: firm or gentle, nudge or push. Firm pushes, such as legislation, may be necessary, for instance, in the arena of tobacco control or even eating choices. But we should be more prepared to try more gentle approaches as well. One of the central new proposals in this year's Budget was SkillsFuture with SkillsFuture grants and accounts, and this encourages Singaporeans to invest in themselves and in their careers.",
            "Should we not consider perhaps a HealthFuture scheme, with financial grants and a HealthFuture account which Singaporeans can use for health maintenance or promotion purposes? Should we not be encouraged, as a people, to invest in our own health, for now and for the future?",
            "This HealthFuture account would be a distinct entity, apart from our Medisave account. The HealthFuture account could take one of many forms. For example, it could be a unique account into which the Government, employers and individuals contribute. Or it can be ear-marked from one's Medisave account, or perhaps even take the form of a tax credit. Singaporeans can make use of their HealthFuture credit to participate in healthy lifestyle programmes, such as smoking cessation or weight loss programmes, exercise classes perhaps in collaboration with ActiveSG, or use it for tailored health screening tests or health monitoring. Those that use their HealthFuture credits wisely and show consistent good health outcomes can receive additional credit, incentivising their proactive health choices.",
            "I just want to make it clear that this is different from providing financial incentives for Singaporeans who do not make use of medical services. It has been previously suggested, of course, that, for example, if one does not see a doctor, then perhaps there could be additional top-ups to their Medisave accounts or perhaps additional rebates for MediShield Life.",
            "The idea against this no-claim bonus type of scheme is that it could deter some patients from seeking early medical treatment in order to receive more financial gains. I believe that this programme which I am suggesting would prove to be a good way to nudge more Singaporeans towards living healthily. After all, it can be argued that every dollar that goes towards health promotion and disease prevention would go much farther if that same dollar went towards disease treatment.",
            "The second challenge concerns how we can make access to health and medical information more equal and symmetrical. Empowering patients with the right information allows them to make better choices for themselves in regard to their own care, and this could help deter over-treatment and over-consumption.",
            "I would like to renew my call to the Ministry to set up a medical therapy and health technology advisory board, which can build consensus on the best available scientific information and provide easy-to-understand information to the general public on the merits of various types of treatment. Such a mechanism will become increasingly important in the years to come as treatments become more varied and complex, and also more expensive, hence placing increasing cost pressures on healthcare spending.",
            "I also foresee more and more conditions becoming medicalised. This is not new. Having high cholesterol in the blood is one good example. The majority of patients with high cholesterol alone are generally well and have no symptoms, but billions of dollars are spent every year on medicines that reduce cholesterol with the aim of avoiding or reducing the risks of getting a heart attack.",
            "Many of us take this as a truism. But actually, controversies rage in the medical community about who we should treat, how much to treat, and given that all these drugs have their fair share of side effects as well, what is the actual value that these drugs have in terms of averting significant disease? We will have more challenges and controversies of a similar nature in the future.",
            "Recently, there has been news about promising prospects for drugs that could soon be developed that would \"cure\" obesity. For such a drug, should taxpayer monies be used to subsidise the use of such a drug? What would be the true value of such treatment? And would it also abrogate personal responsibility for one's health?",
            "Let me now move on to my final area of concern. Another challenge concerns post-hospital care, otherwise referred to as intermediate and long-term care sector. Nursing homes, day care, home care, rehabilitative services, these all fall under this broad category. Due to remarkable advances in medical treatment over the years, more and more patients are surviving horrifying injuries and previously what would be fatal diseases. But that does not necessarily mean that these patients return to their original functional state. More and more patients will need long-term assistance with daily living, and I hope that the Minister can comment on our plans to address the challenges in providing these services in a sustainable way, given our tight labour market and infrastructure constraints. Are there plans to leverage on information technology or perhaps automated or mechanised technologies to provide access to good quality post-hospital care?",
            "There are already many countries which are experimenting with remote systems where caregivers can actually communicate with their charges over information technology systems, such as Skype or various forms of mobile devices. I think this would be a good way of trying to reduce the infrastructure and also manpower constraints or requirements of such care delivery.",
            "As a final point, I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the national plan he mentioned last year on addressing the needs of an ageing population. I have said previously in this House, and will reiterate this again, that an ageing population does not necessarily signify a crisis to the nation, unless we as a nation are unprepared for it. Think not of a \"silver tsunami\" but of a \"silver boom\" or a \"silver dawn\".",
            "Recently, a radio listener remarked that we have to change our attitude from regarding an older worker as \"no good\", to looking towards an older worker to show us \"something good\". And this is an admirable way of looking at this. A healthy senior may actually be more productive in both the social or work environment, than a younger but unfit person.",
            "Many discussions about age perhaps miss the point that perhaps the problem is not so much about age itself, but rather the overall fitness of the individual. Increasing age has typically been associated with increasing infirmity, but this paradigm can and should change if we all learn to live better and healthier from our youthful days. I would like to ask the Minister how his Ministry intends to mould Singapore into a nation for all ages, and how we can go about changing the national conversation on ageing so that we bring about mindset shifts that reject ageism.

In the five years leading to 2014, acute, community and nursing home beds had increased by a not inconsiderable 2,000 beds. Now, in a slightly longer time span, we are planning to add 11,000 beds altogether. This is a huge increase and I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate on how this number will be achieved, the challenges involved and strategies to overcome them.",
            "The opening of the new Ng Teng Fong General Hospital had been postponed by six months to July this year due to construction delays, and I am happy to hear that this is now all on track. But in the midst of tightening of work permits, does the Ministry foresee any issues with the construction of other facilities, including four new community hospitals at Jurong, Yishun, Sengkang and Outram which are opening this year, 2016, 2018 and 2020 respectively, and the Sengkang General Hospital slated for opening in 2018 and, finally, the 12 nursing homes and six new polyclinics slated for the end-2020?",

How many centres are currently in operation and what is their total capacity? How many places are expected to be added every year and, of these, how many would be available for patients with dementia?",

The MOH website points to the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore's website for prices of drugs prescribed for common conditions. But the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore's website only covers medication for asthma, diabetes and high-blood pressure and lipids. The list also does not appear to be updated regularly; it was last updated in September 2013.",
            "The Minister mentioned in his speech last year at the official opening of the Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital that the Government has been a strong advocate of information transparency and wants to work to improve transparency of healthcare charges so that patients can make informed decisions. To this end, would public hospitals take the lead and extend this philosophy to publishing the price of all drugs sold as the next logical step after publishing the cost of surgical procedures, a move which has been well received by many Singaporeans, in order to reduce the information asymmetry for patients and to lower costs in particular?",
            "The Minister has also previously mentioned that different cost structures and purchasing decisions, amongst other reasons, account for the flexibility afforded to various hospitals to purchase drugs directly from pharmaceutical manufacturers, even if they are all subject to general subsidy guidelines and that some drugs are used to cross-subsidise others that may be very expensive. To this end, the price of drugs would logically vary at different public and private hospitals. However, publishing the price of drugs can potentially result in more competitive pricing by pharmaceutical companies and between hospitals even, effectively lowering the cost of drugs to Singaporeans and, in the short to medium term, for the Government, too.",

Is there any indication when this standardised IP schedule will be rolled out?",

This is partly because many patients continue to value being able to have greater choice when it comes to hospitalisation for medical treatment. B1 class wards offer an attractive choice for patients because patients still receive Government subsidies yet still offer the choices and many of the benefits offered by private hospitals.",

The rationale behind that was that with continuous economic and company restructuring, workers are likely to work with several organisations in the course of their working lives. Without the stability and security of a medical benefit insurance that covers them throughout their working lives, they may be caught out badly if they should fall seriously ill while being in between jobs, or when working for a company will little or no medical insurance coverage.",
            "At that time, the national MediShield system was already in place. However, it did not fully serve as the",
            "de facto",
            "portable medical benefits system for workers and companies. This was because of its relatively low payouts, caps and limits, and also because workers are expected to claim against their company insurance policies before claiming against MediShield.",
            "At the company level, it was also difficult to make PMBS work, because of exclusions for pre-existing conditions and how workers should be incentivised to move from first-dollar-coverage company group health insurance coverage to portable arrangements where deductibles and co-payments apply. The tax incentives given to companies to move to PMBS were also not considered attractive by some companies, given the complexities involved. As a result of all these, that effort toward the PMBS did not succeed.",
            "The coming of MediShield Life by the end of this year offers a fresh chance to push this important concept to better protect workers. Unlike the original MediShield, MediShield Life helps overcome several critical problems. It does not exclude pre-existing conditions and it has no lifetime claim limit. All citizens are automatically included and there is no opting out, so coverage is lifelong. With substantial Government subsidies, the premiums will also be kept affordable on an on-going basis and offer good value for money.",
            "There are still important hurdles to be overcome. For example, the MediShield Life offers B2/C inpatient treatment coverage, whereas more than one in three workers are covered in the company group health insurance policies at ward classes above B2/C. There are also no details on the MediShield Life B1 product, such as its premium structure and whether it would exclude the pre-existing conditions. The questions of how to move from first-dollar-coverage from the company group health insurance coverage to portable arrangements where deductibles and co-payments apply must still be tackled. It is not that easy.",
            "Nonetheless, I feel that this time the gap has at least has been narrowed and there is a fighting chance for PMBS at B2/C level to become a basic company level insurance coverage economy wide, with employers incentivising workers to defray their premiums for MediShield Life and anticipated deductibles and co-payment riders, and the Government perhaps incentivising employers to move decisively in that direction.",
            "I wish to ask when will the B1 ward coverage details be made available, so that companies are in a better position also to gauge how they can potentially transit their workers, whether into the B2/C standard coverage or perhaps even the possibility of considering beyond that and what particular arrangements. I also wish to find out if Government would consider enhancing the tax incentives for companies to move to PMBS, with particular emphasis on building company level coverage upon the MediShield Life scheme.",

My Parliamentary Secretary Assoc Prof Faishal will elaborate on our health promotion efforts later.",
            "Let me update the House on the progress of Healthcare 2020, as requested by Dr Chia Shi-Lu.",
            "First, on infrastructure developments. Over the last decade, we have added more than 1,200 acute beds, and 500 community hospital beds. From now till 2020, we target to add at least 1,700 acute beds, from our two new general hospitals. This rate of expansion of development is more than double that in the last decade. The Ng Teng Fong General Hospital is scheduled to open by July 2015. I am pleased to let Members know that we have achieved Temporary Occupancy Permits (TOP) for both the Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOC) tower and the ward tower of the hospital.",
            "Our care model will evolve as our population ages. Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about rehabilitative care. Rehabilitation plays a pivotal role in our care of an ageing population. We are strengthening rehabilitative care by more than doubling our capacity for community hospitals. Minister of State Dr Lam Pin Min will talk more about plans on this area and my Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor will share how the Ministry is developing manpower to support rehabilitation, as well as strengthening home and community care.",
            "Our specialist centres are also being expanded and upgraded to better serve Singaporeans. Last year, we opened the new National Heart Centre (NHC) building. By 2019, we will open a new Centre for Oral Health (COH) at the NUH. This will allow us to expand dental services for Singaporeans and provide more training capacity for dentists and dental therapists.",
            "We are also improving Singaporeans' access to quality primary care within their communities. Last year, I announced that we would be building two new polyclinics in Jurong West and Punggol.",
            "This year, I am pleased to announce that we will build a new polyclinic and, in answer to Mr Liang Eng Hwa, this new polyclinic will be in Bukit Panjang. This will serve residents staying in the region. This will also relieve pressure on nearby polyclinics, such as Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic. We will also be redeveloping Yishun and Marine Parade polyclinics to better serve residents there.",
            "Mdm Chair, even as we build more facilities, we also need to continue to find new ways to give better care to our patients.",
            "Our healthcare Clusters have been working with community partners to provide more holistic care for our patients in the community setting. For example, the Eastern Health Alliance (EHA) and its community partners have been deploying professionals together with neighbourhood volunteers to reach out to at-risk residents, through their Neighbours for Active Living programme.",
            "Take Mr Sim, for instance. He is an 82-year-old resident living in Tampines, suffering from multiple chronic conditions. He has difficulties walking after a fall and is currently being cared for by his 75-year-old wife, Mdm Liew. The EHA team checks on Mr Sim to make sure he takes his medication, and applies for the various medical and transport subsidies for the couple. They also bought a walking frame and guided Mr Sim on how to use it. Today, the team regularly calls and visits the elderly couple to make sure that they are well.",
            "Let me now move on to healthcare financing. The Ministry of Health has made three major policy shifts to give patients and their families greater peace of mind about healthcare costs. First, the Government would shoulder a higher share of national healthcare spending. Second, we expanded the use of Medisave and helped Singaporeans to save more in their Medisave accounts. Third, we will increase the role of risk-pooling through MediShield Life.",
            "We have significantly enhanced subsidies, especially for the lower- and middle-income families in the subsidised SOCs and for outpatient drugs. To date, about 360,000 patients have benefited from the higher subsidies. Pioneers also receive additional subsidies. Since September last year, about 340,000 or about three-quarters of all Pioneers have enjoyed the benefits.",
            "One such patient is 70-year-old Mdm Lee Soon Meng. She visits the National Neuroscience Institute four times a year. She used to pay a subsidised rate of $50 for tests and consultation a visit. In September last year, her bill was reduced to $30 due to the enhanced subsidy, then further halved to $15 as she is a Pioneer. For medication, she can expect to pay only $20 a visit this year instead of the usual $80, after taking into account both the enhanced subsidies and her Pioneer benefits.",
            "For those requiring longer term care, we have progressively extended subsidies to drugs prescribed by Intermediate and Long Term Care (ILTC) providers since 1 January this year. Mrs Lina Chiam asked about pensioners' eligibility for pensions coverage in approved community hospitals. Pensioners are eligible to claim for their stay if they stay in Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kuan Community Hospital. Mrs Chiam also suggested that we extend Medisave limits for pensioners in community hospitals. The current withdrawal limit is generally sufficient as it covers eight out of 10 bills. With MediShield Life which covers community hospital stays, almost all patients would see their community hospital bills fully covered by MediShield Life and Medisave. Those who still need help can appeal and we will exercise some flexibility on a case-by-case basis.",
            "Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Dr Chia Shi-Lu have asked about further flexibility for outpatient Medisave usage. We have made steady progress on this second front. Recent Medisave changes include extending Medisave use to outpatient scans. From 1 April this year, under the new outpatient Flexi-Medisave scheme, the elderly aged 65 and above can use another $200 per year from Medisave to pay for outpatient medical treatment at SOCs, polyclinics and participating Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) clinics.",
            "We just expanded the list of chronic diseases covered under Medisave and CHAS last year. I am glad to announce that four more chronic conditions – epilepsy, osteoporosis, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis – will be covered under CHAS and Medisave use from 1 June this year. This brings the total number of chronic conditions covered to 19, which covers the most common chronic conditions.",
            "Mrs Chiam has proposed for the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) to cover eczema. CDMP conditions are selected based on professional inputs, taking into consideration various factors, such as disease prevalence and the effectiveness of early intervention to reduce complications. There is currently no plan to include eczema in the CDMP but we will take note of Mrs Chiam's request. We regularly review this programme from time to time. But, meanwhile, Singaporeans can enjoy subsidised treatment for eczema at the polyclinics, SOCs and CHAS GP clinics, a point that Mrs Chiam asked. Those with difficulties can also approach the Medical Social Workers at our public healthcare institutions for assistance.",
            "We will continue to review Medisave use, but this has to be balanced against the need to ensure that our Medisave savings are adequate for our retirement healthcare expenses. In January this year, we increased the Medisave contribution rate from employers to help Singaporeans save more. I hear Dr Chia's call to fine-tune and simplify our Medisave rules, and so we will do that.",
            "Today, let me just explain. There are two limits on the Medisave account. One is the Medisave Minimum Sum (MMS). This is the minimum amount you need to have in your Medisave before you can withdraw your other CPF monies from age 55. The other is the Medisave Contribution Ceiling (MCC). This is the upper limit on your Medisave savings. Any additional Medisave contributions beyond this amount will flow to your Retirement or Special Accounts. Dr Chia has asked if we can consider adjustment to these limits and we will do so.",
            "To simplify the rules, we will remove the Medisave Minimum Sum (MMS). This means that you will no longer be required to use your CPF monies to first top up your Medisave account to the MMS when you apply to withdraw your CPF monies from the other accounts at the age of 55. You only need to follow the withdrawal rules as explained by the Minister for Manpower earlier.",
            "Second, from January 2016, the Medisave Contribution Ceiling (MCC) will be renamed as the Basic Healthcare Sum. This is line with CPF terminology and reflects more accurately that the sum is estimated based on what is needed for basic subsidised healthcare needs in our old age. So, MMS will be removed; MCC will be renamed Basic Healthcare Sum.",
            "Any additional Medisave contributions beyond the Basic Healthcare Sum will continue to be channelled to your Retirement and Special Accounts, and, eventually, will help to increase your CPF LIFE payouts.",
            "The new Basic Healthcare Sum will be set at $49,800 on 1 January 2016. This is a 2.7% increase over the current MCC of $48,500 set last year. Beyond 2016, we will need to adjust the Basic Healthcare Sum annually to keep pace with the growth in Medisave use by the elderly. This is necessary given rising life expectancy and healthcare expenditure, and given the expanding use of Medisave.",
            "Currently, the annual MMS adjustments are applied to all cohorts, including older Singaporeans who are well into retirement. From 2016, we will fix the Basic Healthcare Sum for each cohort when they turn 65 years, with no subsequent changes in their lifetime, so that members can have more certainty on the amount of Medisave that they should keep for their retirement healthcare needs.",
            "This cohort-based approach for the Basic Healthcare Sum is also similar to the approach that has been taken for the Retirement Sum. We hope that this will make it easier for members to understand and to plan their retirement.",
            "Mr Ang Wei Neng asked for an update on the implementation details of MediShield Life. I thank Members for their unanimous support of the MediShield Life Scheme Bill which was passed in Parliament in January.",
            "There is much for MOH and CPF Board to do before MediShield Life coverage kicks in at the end of 2015. Singaporeans need not apply to join MediShield Life. You will automatically be included. You will be notified of the new premiums and the subsidies you will receive as and when your existing MediShield policy is due for renewal during the one-year period starting end of 2015, when MediShield Life coverage starts. Let me just clarify: the coverage for MediShield Life will start by the end of this year for all Singaporeans, but premium payments will only be due when your existing policy is due over the course of next year.",
            "I want to assure Singaporeans once again that MediShield Life premiums will be affordable. Singaporeans will be able to pay for the premiums using their Medisave. The Government will also help through various forms of subsidies.",
            "The Pioneer Package and the Transitional Subsidies will be given independent of income and wealth. For Premium Subsidies targeted at the lower and middle-income, there is also no need for individuals to apply. Government will use information available in our records to identify those who are eligible and the amount that you are eligible for. But you can help by doing a simple check to ensure that your household information is up-to-date and accurate. In a few months' time, Ministry of Health will be sending out a letter with more details on what Singaporeans need to do. We will guide you along step by step so there is no need to worry.",
            "Mr Ang and Dr Chia also asked about the progress of the development of the Standard Integrated Shield Plan, or Standard IP.",
            "Let me first talk about Integrated Shield Plans or IPs. IPs comprise two parts. The first part is a basic MediShield portion run by the CPF Board. This portion is the same for those without IPs and for those with IPs. They are the same. When MediShield Life is implemented at the end of this year, it will automatically replace the MediShield component.",
            "The second portion is the additional private insurance coverage run by private insurers, typically to cover Classes A and B1 in public hospitals, or private hospitals. In other words, all IP policyholders are already covered by MediShield today and they will be covered by MediShield Life in time to come. Similarly, IP premiums also include MediShield premiums. There is therefore no double coverage, and no double premium.",
            "Many Singaporeans also shared that it was difficult to compare IPs, and wanted a standardised option with enhanced coverage beyond Class B2 and C. Ministry of Health has been working with the Integrated Plan insurers to develop a Standard IP, based on coverage at Class B1 wards. Benefits will be aligned across all insurers, so that the plan can be easily understood. Those looking for enhanced coverage that is more affordable than Class A or private hospital plans can consider this plan, Standard IP. We aim to introduce the new Standard IP in the first half of 2016, soon after the rollout of the MediShield Life this year. This will give time for Singaporeans to focus on MediShield Life, and better understand and adjust to the changes resulting from MediShield Life before the changes to the IPs are made.",
            "To help policy holders to make informed decisions about buying IPs, MOH is working with Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to ensure that insurers present their products more transparently and more accurately. This will also address Dr Chia's concern on IPs.",
            "Most Singaporeans use Medisave to pay for MediShield and IPs. Since every IP policy comprises two parts, it is also timely to consider restructuring the Medisave Withdrawal Limits, or MWLs, for health insurance premiums also into two components. Today, the Medisave Withdrawal Limits, or MWLs apply to the total IP premium, combining premiums for MediShield and the additional private insurance coverage.",
            "Singaporeans are not aware of how much Medisave is being used for MediShield and how much is directed towards the additional private insurance component. With MediShield Life, we will give Singaporeans more certainty, by ensuring that Medisave will always be allowed to cover the net MediShield Life premiums including additional premiums if any, and after subsidies. There is therefore really no need to set a withdrawal limit for this component that applies to the MediShield Life premium. But beyond this, there will be an Additional Withdrawal Limit, or AWL, that will apply to the premium for additional private insurance coverage only.",
            "Today, the withdrawal limit applies to the entire premium of the IP, which comprises two components – the MediShield and the additional private insurance coverage. Going forward, we will restructure this withdrawal limit. Medisave will cover the entire premium that is applicable for MediShield Life for everyone. Therefore, there is no need to set a limit for the withdrawal to pay for MediShield Life premiums. But we do need to set a limit for the private insurance coverage component, and that limit will be called the Additional Withdrawal Limit. The details of that limit will be shared with Singaporeans later.",
            "In setting the new Additional Withdrawal Limits, we will have to balance between helping Singaporeans pay for their IP premiums using Medisave, and ensuring that they have enough Medisave for their other healthcare needs.",
            "Mr Heng Chee How suggested that the introduction of MediShield Life might offer a fresh chance to revisit the concept of portable medical benefits to better protect our workers. I shared last year that a tripartite work group has been formed to look into this. Tripartite partners will be engaging employers to discuss how adoption of portable medical benefits can be further encouraged and I will be very happy to support the work group, if necessary, to ensure that we make progress on this portable medical benefit front.",
            "We also need to help patients navigate their healthcare journey and make more informed decisions. Since 1 September last year, we have expanded our regular hospital bill publications to include \"Total Operation Fees\" for the public sector.",
            "Mr Pritam Singh asked if the Ministry of Health can look into publishing drug prices. In the public hospitals, charges and subsidies that patients receive for their drugs are reflected in the patient's pharmacy bills in an itemised manner. Treatment and drugs used for different patients will vary, even for the same condition, and drugs constitute only one aspect of the overall treatment. This is further complicated by the subsidies for different groups. Private GPs also adopt different pricing structures for drugs and consultation. Hence, it is more useful to reflect the total bill, as a comparison to help patients make decisions.",
            "Let me now come to the issue of ageing as raised by Dr Chia and Ms Ellen Lee. As noted by Ms Lee, our future seniors will have different aspirations from the current generation. Last year, the Ministerial Committee on Ageing (MCA) announced plans to develop an Action Plan for Successful Ageing.",
            "Since then, we have gone on to engage more than 1,300 Singaporeans through many focus group discussions. Many participants shared with us what successful ageing meant to them, at the individual, community, and at the city-level. At the individual level, many seniors told us that they aspire to have opportunities for learning and employment so as to remain active. Seniors are also keen to volunteer their time and expertise and in doing so, find new meaning and fulfilment in their lives.",
            "At the community level, seniors also enjoy social activities with their families and friends and suggested having more spaces and programmes in the community to support these interactions. At the city-level, seniors also provided useful feedback on how our built environment can be enhanced to make it easier and safer for seniors to move around and stay active, creating a city for all ages.",
            "Respective Ministries will study these ideas and develop specific programmes under the Action Plan. For instance, we are working with Ministry of Education to study how to further expand the scope and scale of learning opportunities for seniors to enrich and empower them.",
            "We are also working with MCCY to make volunteering more accessible, attractive and meaningful for our seniors. Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Transport have also taken into account the feedback from focus groups and are exploring ways to enhance the employability of older workers, and make our public transportation network more senior-friendly.",
            "Over the next few months, we will be studying and seeking inputs, such as how to promote senior learning and volunteerism, how to support seniors living in our heartlands with assisted living services, and how to promote research and innovation to transform the lives of seniors in the future. These initiatives will help equip our current seniors as well as prepare our future generations of seniors for meaningful ageing. More details will be announced when the Action Plan is ready later this year.",
            "Madam, we are celebrating SG50 this year. Singapore has made good progress over the last 50 years as a young nation. To recognise the contributions of our seniors and to celebrate SG50 with them, we will be introducing the SG50 Seniors' package. Over the past year, MOH and the Singapore Business Federation have partnered more than 100 organisations to develop special benefits to our seniors. These benefits will be available to seniors for a time-limited period in 2015, to recognise their contribution to Singapore and to celebrate SG50 with them. Some of the benefits in the SG50 Seniors package include: i) dining discounts at more than 50 F&B establishments island-wide; ii) discounted or free entry to places of attraction as well as discounts off hotels and travel packages; and iii) complimentary courses offered by Council for Third Age's senior learning providers.",
            "This is one way of bringing the whole society together to celebrate SG50 with our seniors and to honour them with special privileges and benefits.",
            "Dr Chia asked about the progress on our plans to meet the long-term needs for healthcare services. What is next after Healthcare 2020? Even as we continue to work hard on implementing Healthcare 2020, the journey to transform our healthcare system is a continuous one. We have started work to look beyond 2020, to prepare for Singapore's long term healthcare needs.",
            "As Assoc Prof Fatimah has pointed out, the Government and all stakeholders have important parts to play in ensuring the long term sustainability of our healthcare system. At an individual level, enhancing Government subsidies, MediShield Life, Medisave and Medifund will help to ensure healthcare remains affordable to individual patients. But such measures are insufficient on their own – we must also ensure that overall healthcare bill grows at an affordable pace, so that we – as individual patients and as a society – can continue to afford it. We need to ensure that we make the best use of all our available healthcare resources.",
            "Longer-term sustainability also requires that our healthcare providers play their part in delivering cost-effective services. Patients rely on healthcare providers to advise and act in their best interests, and provide treatments that are appropriate and necessary.",
            "My Ministry will be placing more emphasis on developing capabilities in assessing new health technologies, including devices and drugs, to ensure that they are both clinically-effective and cost-effective. This will ensure that patients get the most bang for their buck for the treatment and medications that they receive.",
            "Our long-term healthcare strategy will involve further and deeper transformative changes to both the way care is organised, as well as the way it is delivered. We have been taking steps towards this by developing community care and setting up Regional Health Systems. We will go further in the next phase to integrate our healthcare system.",
            "In particular, we will also study how to bring together the public, people and private sectors, and explore more ways to strengthen partnerships among various stakeholders to optimise the use of scarce healthcare manpower and infrastructure. Over time, the aim is for one integrated national healthcare system where everyone works together as a team to serve the needs of all Singaporeans.",
            "Mr Alex Yam and Dr Chia asked about our efforts in IT productivity. IT plays an important role in healthcare delivery and we will be launching a new Community Hospital Common System (CHCS) to all community hospitals by end of this year to link up their IT systems with partnering public healthcare institutions. This will help healthcare professionals across acute and community hospitals share information on their patients and improve the patient's care experience.",
            "Mdm Chair, under Healthcare 2020, we have made progress towards making our healthcare system a better one. We will press on with our plans, but we must also look ahead into the future. We have started our planning processes to prepare for the future. We must continue on this journey to innovate and transform our healthcare system to ensure that it is a quality, affordable and sustainable one to keep Singaporeans healthy beyond 2020.",

However, the number of baby boomers reaching their silver years continues to increase annually. With the increase in retirees, the demand for home and community care is expected to rise rapidly as well. Hence, could the MOH share what is the current ratio of applicants for home care and community care to the vacancies available? Could the MOH also share how it plans to increase the capacity at these settings?",

Will the Ministry increase access to rehabilitative services for our elderly within the home or community care settings? These elderly tend to be less mobile and, thus, more vulnerable. Travelling too far from home for rehabilitative services will be too much of a struggle for them and their family members who may have to ferry them to and fro."

            ": Madam, Singapore's fast-ageing society will bring about a host of challenges and issues in healthcare that may require a rethink in terms of how we provide assistance to those who are in need.",
            "One particular area which I would like to highlight which requires more attention is people who suffer from hearing loss. The increase in number of seniors who have gone through evaluation tests from hearing loss: 6,800 in 2010 up to 8,600 cases in 2012 and the figures will keep increasing. There is no single cure for age-related hearing loss because there is no single disease and often there is no specific disease but rather a process of associated with advancing age.",
            "People of any age with hearing loss become more socially isolated, become less able to contribute to conversations and are unable to engage effectively with family and friends and be part of everyday social life. This can lead to a significant reduction in the quality of life as it impacts on social interactions, the willingness to venture out of one's home, the ability to easy access public resources and the enjoyment of culture entertainment in public spaces.",
            "Hearing aids help and often can be life changing but they are extremely expensive, especially those that are comfortable and provide good sound quality. Prices range from $500 to as high as more than $6,000. With an average life expectancy of a device about five years, there is also a significant recurring cost. Very often a senior using a hearing aid for the time will choose a simpler, cheaper model but then becomes frustrated with the fit and the sound quality, and end up not using it, retreating back into relative social isolation.",
            "There are a number of mechanisms to assist in the purchase of hearing aids from the Centre for Enabled Living, the Agency for Integrated Care. These are means-tested and much appreciated by the beneficiaries. The real problem is the underlying cost which is a significant barrier.",
            "A hearing aid is essentially a microphone, a speaker and a processor. These are components in every smart phone which retail for significantly less. The engineering has to be of a high quality for it to be adequately miniaturised. But the two main reasons for the high cost are the market oligopoly – there are about six companies worldwide, three are active in Singapore – and the regulatory framework for these devices. The second factor, the regulatory framework, imposes a high cost on the development and testing processes of a new model and further constrains the process by which can be made available in the market only through licensed practitioners.",
            "I would like to suggest that this is an area ripe for disruptive innovation. If we in Singapore could develop a cheap and effective hearing aid, leveraging on the excellence in precision engineering that we have, together with the biomedical sciences we could have a product or a series of products which will have significant market as the rest of Asia ages along with us. We will engage two of the growth clusters – applied health sciences and advanced manufacturing – described in the Budget.",
            "How might we do this? We could begin by supporting this initiative within the engineering departments of our Institutes of Higher Learning with dedicated research grants. We could have a prize offered on a shared basis by both the public institutions and the private sector to incentivise the Singaporean start-up to translate the engineering into a product to bring to market.",
            "We would also need to change to the market environment, firstly, by making the use of hearing aids more socially acceptable. I am always struck that the taxi uncles and various people are quite happy to have a very large Bluetooth earphone, sometimes with a blinking light, but the seniors, including my elderly relatives, are very concerned that their hearing aid are as discreet as possible. What if we develop a hearing aid that was externally indistinguishable from the Bluetooth headphones or the iconic white headphones of a particular brand of smart phone.",
            "Further, in order to incentivise the research and the business, we could make some changes to ensure that they will have a larger market to serve by increasing the number of seniors who would be eligible for a subsidised hearing aid provided that it was locally developed and below a certain affordable cost.",
            "One further variable would be the issue of the regulatory framework. I agree that the recommendation, prescription, maintenance and ongoing service of the device and the user should continue within a well-regulated framework as cause of hearing loss may well be a disease. However, headphones that are used for listening maybe worn for just as much time and may potentially generate just as much damage if used incorrectly.",
            "To classify one as medical device and the other as an IT peripheral is anachronistic and adds to the cost burden of developing a new product. I would suggest that this regulatory framework should be studied and reviewed with the aim of reducing the cost required to develop and own a new product.",
            "All these would, hopefully, give a few Singaporean businesses the foundation, the research grounding, the market and market experience to have high quality, affordable locally-developed hearing aid that might be able to serve the needs of a rapidly ageing Asia.",
            "We spent millions of dollars in altering our physical environment so as to provide barrier-free access to our citizens who face challenges in mobility. There are other barriers that can prevent one from seamlessly integrating with the society on a daily basis. I have highlighted hearing loss as one, and I hope that the Ministry will see this as a pressing need in making Singapore a more inclusive society for all.",

Even without accidents or illnesses, we lose our functional abilities as we age. It is therefore important that we should effectively create greater awareness and understanding of the risks of disability and the measures to prevent or mitigate disabilities.",

I know we can never achieve zero disability but let us try to reduce and do what we can to mitigate. Such initiatives may address risk factors, early detection and management of complications and loss of functions. I am not talking about medical intervention. I am not even talking about Allied Health Professionals being involved in this. But how do we educate our members of the public, people who live in our own HDB flats, in our own homes to be able to detect the early onset of a disability or the early onset of complications arising from a disability?",
            "Relevant measures also would include taking such public education initiatives to schools, to workplaces and to just the public in general. As such, public education should be taken on a focused basis as well as holistically because it is a part of public health. As much as we good in conducting campaigns, I hope the Government would also consider more public education initiatives in this respect and I await the Government's response.",

Her teenage daughter was in the flat at the time while this tragedy unfolded. The state coroner also found that the woman had never been formally diagnosed with a mental illness while alive, although she told her family that she was hearing voices and was displaying signs of paranoia.",
            "This tragedy illustrates how difficult a problem mental illness is in the community. Often, patients who suffer from mental illnesses or conditions refuse any efforts at intervention, medical or otherwise. Those who have been treated may also fail to follow-up on their treatment or medication, resulting in their conditions relapsing or even worsening. Their family members may also find it difficult to know what needs to be done or even recognise that their loved one may be suffering from a mental health condition and need intervention. Fear of social stigma together with the lack of awareness by both the patient and the family only serves to make matters worse.",

            "Real day-to-day problems, for example, neighbour disputes over alleged smells and conspiracies to fix each other, poor personal and home hygiene, littering, noise disturbances to neighbours, and the list goes on. These issues that are left unsolved threaten to deepen the prejudices that people may have of those suffering from mental health issues. The animosity in turn makes it more difficult for those suffering from these conditions or even their family members to consider the issue and seek professional help. As a result, the problems such as the ones highlighted above continue to worsen and the rift between neighbours continues to widen.",
            "Allow me to share an example. There is a retiree couple living on the ground floor of one of the HDB blocks in my area. Their neighbour on the top floor was alleged to have been pouring liquids out of the window on a daily basis, thereby soiling the clothes of the nine other family members below this unit. Affected neighbours believe that these acts were committed by a person of unsound mind. The retiree couple are very troubled by the daily recurrence of such acts, with the wife observably distressed. The retiree couple's daughter, who is well-educated and apparently working in the legal profession, has been very upset over the matter after observing her mother's distress.",
            "Let me quote parts of her email, \"While one sympathises with the perpetrator whom we understand is of unsound mind, his family members should be put in place in terms of the responsibility of the perpetrator's action. However, it does not change the fact that at the very least, nine other households have suffered and are still, as a result of his actions.",
            "Action may be taken against the family of the perpetrator, who should be responsible for his well-being and in ensuring that he does not commit acts which causes nuisance, suffering to others. If the family in question is incapable of fulfilling such a basic task, then perhaps he should be placed in the care of those who are capable.\"",
            "Meanwhile, the unit on the top floor felt that they had been bullied by the lower floor neighbours and became defensive.",
            "While we had sought help from various agencies, ranging from NEA, HDB, Town Council and AIC, and while they are still investigating the matter, it is clear from the statements made by the daughter that if we do not resolve the root cause of the matter, the vicious cycle will perpetuate. Moreover, such statements coming from a well-educated individual whom I believe should understand reason. Hence, it is imperative for the Government to put in place stronger measures to ensure professional help and adherence to treatment for those suffering from mental health conditions so as to help them better control their behaviours. Otherwise, the rift will never close and the stigma will never go away.",
            "More importantly, let us help those people from mental health issues get back on track in life. At present, there is no effective mechanism to ensure that those suffering from mental health issues seek help or treatment unless they pose a threat to others or if they have pre-existing records with IMH. However, many of the protagonists in these problems do not meet these criteria. They may engage in verbal fights but pose no physical harm to others. Given that they resist seeking professional help, it also suggests that they never had an insight to their condition and with the stigma against them, that possibility is even more remote. Through community engagements and partnerships, I have observed the commendable effort put in by agencies and community partners in persuading family members to convince the person to seek help. However, this too has limitations.",

Recently, we launched a Request for Proposal (RFP) under the Build-Own-Lease model for a Senior Care Centre at Ci Yuan CC that is open to both the VWO and private sectors. Providers have to tender to operate day services in the senior care centre as well as offer home care services out of the centre.",

Yes, we anticipate an increase in rehabilitation needs with an ageing population, so we have been adding capacity in community hospitals, day centres and home rehabilitation, including an upcoming day centre at Kaki Bukit. In addition to the expansion of day centres, which will mean more day rehab places, we are also adding capacity in community hospitals.",
            "The fact that elderly may not follow up with rehab could be due to other factors as well, such as no transport to day rehab. This April, we will enhance transport subsidies under the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) so that more seniors can benefit from it. We will extend transport subsidy under SMF to all seniors requiring some form of mobility assistance and not just to wheelchair bound seniors attending rehabilitation and dialysis services or those attending dementia day care services, to get to MOH-funded eldercare and dialysis centres. The level of funding support given will be based on mobility needs, and MOH will provide more funding support to eldercare providers to arrange for specialised transport for less ambulant seniors.",
            "MOH expects to provide additional funding of some $14 million from the SMF to support eldercare providers to provide transportation to clients. An additional 1,000 elderly will benefit from this enhancement, up from some 2,000 seniors now.",

            "We raised subsidies for intermediate and long-term care in 2012, including for day rehab services. We also started subsidies for home rehab last year. Since subsidies started from 1 April last year, some 370 patients have benefited as at the end of 2014.

The total physiotherapy and occupational therapy intakes at Nanyang Polytechnic have increased by 58%, from 104 in 2007 to 164 in 2014. Similarly, the biennial intake for speech therapy at the National University of Singapore has increased by 15%, from 20 in 2007 to 23 this year.",

            "While it is important to enhance capacity, we have also worked to improve the quality of home and community care. Last year, we announced the development of the new home-based care, community care and palliative care guidelines. We have since conducted a series of focus group discussions with providers, patients and caregivers. There has been overwhelming support and some suggestions to enhance the guidelines, which we have incorporated. The home-based care and community care guidelines have now been finalised and AIC will work with providers to make improvements to their quality of care based on these guidelines.",

MOH's National Medical Research Council has earlier provided grants for innovations related to hearing problems in seniors. We will study with A*STAR and NRF on how to promote research, innovation and market access of products needed by our seniors, including hearing aids. Currently, Singaporean seniors who are 60 years old and above with hearing difficulties can apply under the SMF or Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund for up to 90% subsidies to defray the cost of hearing aids. So far, more than 1,400 seniors have benefited from SMF subsidies for hearing aids. The SMF is the main source of help for Singaporean seniors while the Special Assistance Fund (SAF) targets persons with disabilities of other age groups. A senior who is eligible for SMF will not be eligible for the SAF. AIC works closely with SGEnable to refer applications to the appropriate fund. Since July 2013, close to $17 million in subsidies have been disbursed from the SMF.",

Caregivers can drop off their loved ones for a few hours to run their errands or just chill out. We now have 280 places each weekend, since introducing the service in April last year.

            "Sir, we believe that it is possible for psychiatric patients to stay well in the community, if we set up a good system to support them. Let me elaborate.",
            "First, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has in place an after-care programme to support discharged patients who are assessed to be at higher risk of default or had more severe illnesses. IMH reminds these patients of their follow-up treatment through regular telephone calls and even home visits when necessary.",
            "Second, IMH has put in place a 24-hour Mental Health Helpline to provide immediate support for patients and their caregivers whenever needed. Community partners can also call the hotline, regardless of whether the cases have pre-existing records with IMH. If a patient refuses or defaults on treatment, IMH will work closely with family members, caregivers and other community partners to engage the patients.",
            "Sometimes, it does take a village to enable patients to recover and recover well in the community. Hence, a third area is to further strengthen community support by building local community support networks (LCSNs) among grassroots leaders and volunteers, social work agencies, the Police and town councils, to enable them to respond to residents who may have mental health issues. Over the past year, we have been in touch with over 20 constituencies and trained over 400 grassroots leaders and volunteers. Take Kembangan Chai Chee (KCC) as an example. A network of volunteers comprising 120 grassroots leaders, volunteers and partners have been given basic mental health and eldercare education, and are equipped to identify residents in need and link them to various help needed.",
            "Finally, we want to enhance the capability of primary and community care to help detect and support the treatment of mental health patients. Since 2012, we have partnered and trained 70 GP partners to attend to mental health patients. We established nine community-based specialist and allied health teams to support GPs with clinical advice and allied health services. To date, these teams served over 4,700 patients, providing them with access to holistic care closer to home.",
            "MOH launched the Community Mental Health Masterplan in 2012 to strengthen access to psychiatric care. With the pilots that we have started in the past two years in primary care and fostering community support systems, we are ready to scale up our efforts over the next three years.",
            "First, we aim to train and partner 120 GPs and set up a total of 17 allied health and specialist-led teams in the community with a total capacity to serve up to 21,000 clients by 2017. Second, through our outreach, we hope to set up similar local community support networks and engage a total of 50 constituencies. Third, we target to expand IMH's aftercare services and enlist more community-based VWO teams to provide long-term support. Together with the constituency-level community support, these community-based aftercare teams aim to serve around 5,000 clients by 2017.",
            "We will also beef up our capability to support seniors with dementia, under our community mental health plans. According to a recent study conducted by IMH on the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WISE), we understand that the prevalence of dementia amongst seniors aged 60 years and above is 10%. Hence, with an ageing population, there will be more elderly with dementia in the future.",
            "We will enhance the capability in public hospitals and the community for seniors requiring assessment for dementia. To date, we have expanded capacity in six outpatient memory clinics in the public hospitals to provide early assessment and intervention for dementia patients. Specialists from the RHSes will also partner 50 GPs to manage dementia clients within the community.",
            "We will also be scaling up the capacity of community based dementia care services. As of December last year, we have put in place around 650 day dementia care places, increased the number of eldersitters to 90, and put in place 575 dementia nursing home beds. By 2020, we will increase day dementia care places to at least 3,000, increase the number of eldersitters to 160 and increase dementia nursing home beds to 1,970 beds.",
            "We will expand our partnership with voluntary welfare organisations to outreach and educate seniors and their caregivers on how to pick up early signs of dementia and seek help. We will more than triple the number of community outreach teams from the current seven to 24 teams by 2017, to reach out to seniors island-wide.",
            "In addition, we want to put in place support programmes to help caregivers of dementia patients cope. For example, we have the dementia home intervention services for caregivers of seniors who display behavioural issues. For caregivers who need time away from their caregiving duties, we have put in place the weekend respite care and eldersitter service.",
            "We are partnering some VWOs to innovate new responses to support patients and caregivers. For example, Montfort Care set up the Happy Kopitiam located at Marine Drive and Telok Blangah. This is led by a social worker with the help of volunteers to provide caregivers with education, support and respite care. Both caregivers and clients are also encouraged to participate in activities together. And this is an example of a ground-driven initiative to enable our seniors to age gracefully at home without over-medicalising our care.",
            "We will be embarking on a major ramp up of our health and aged care services in the next five years. We need more Singaporeans to join us in our mission to provide the best care for our citizens. And this is a concern that is also shared by Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Tin Pei Ling.",
            "To support these expansions, we have estimated that the healthcare professional workforce will need to grow by about 50%, or 20,000 more between 2011 and 2020.",
            "We are on track to meet our manpower needs. Our healthcare professional workforce expanded by 9,000 between 2011 and 2014. We are expanding the local training pipelines and would also like to see more mid-career entrants, especially women re-entering the workforce and retired nurses, to join us.",
            "There is a wide choice of employment locations near home, especially in the aged care sector. AIC has been working with WDA, NTUC, e2i and CDCs to organise geographically-targeted recruitment fairs to attract more residents to take up jobs in the ILTC sector. Since April last year, AIC has co-organised 20 recruitment fairs and will continue to do so this year.",
            "Our work to enhance the attractiveness of healthcare careers will continue. MOH will continue to review salaries regularly for all healthcare staff to recognise their contributions fairly and to keep pace with the market. Beyond remuneration, our public healthcare institutions and aged care providers have enabled healthcare staff to better meet their work-life priorities through flexible employment options and part-time work arrangements. There is also progress in adopting IT innovations to lessen the administrative work of healthcare staff. With less time spent on administrative work, our Patient Service Associates (PSAs) in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, for example, can then be up-skilled to take on certain roles that are traditionally performed by pharmacy technicians or nurses. PSAs' career progression is enhanced, while nurses and pharmacy technicians have their time freed up to focus on more complex work.",

            "Ms Ellen Lee and Ms Tin Pei Ling asked for an update on the workplace health grant for women's health. Sir, the Women's Health Advisory Committee (WHAC), which I chair, introduced the Workplace Health Grant for women in July 2013. Organisations may use the grant to encourage female employees to go for breast and cervical cancer screening and organise women's health talks on chronic diseases and other conditions, and it has been well received. As of February this year, 71 out of the 78 applications have been approved and we are on track to reach out to 100 companies by end of this year. Moving forward, HPB will encourage the uptake of the grant and women's health programmes at the workplaces.",

Will MOH consider setting up a hotline for Singaporeans to report on such abuses? Thank you.",

            ": Since 2012, we have taken significant steps to make primary care more accessible and affordable to Singaporeans through our network of primary care facilities.",
            "Under the Healthcare 2020 Masterplan, MOH's key thrust for primary care was to better tap on GPs in the private sector to improve the access, quality and affordability of primary care. Part of the plans was to introduce new innovative care models such as our Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs).",
            "Since then, we have developed six FMCs and six CHCs. Patients, especially those requiring care for chronic conditions, now have more options for their medical follow-up. One example is Ang Mo Kio FMC, which has been serving patients in the Ang Mo Kio and Central areas since 2013. Care managers identify suitable patients who can be referred to the FMC, and share with them the services and benefits available there. Because patient volumes at the FMC are lower, waiting times are shorter. Moreover, patients visiting Ang Mo Kio FMC will get to see the same family doctor across visits, and are also assured of the same level of care as experienced at the polyclinic.",
            "One patient who has benefited from visiting Ang Mo Kio FMC is Mdm Betty Lee Oi Neay, aged 67 years old, who has both diabetes and hypertension. At the age of 38, Mdm Lee was referred by a heart specialist to Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic. In 2014, she moved to the FMC. She is happy to visit the FMC as she only waits 20 to 30 minutes to see the doctor. With her Pioneer CHAS benefits, she does not need to pay much for each visit.",
            "The FMCs have also encouraged shared care programmes between hospitals and GPs, and reinforced the role of GPs as \"first-line\" doctors. For example, the National University Hospital (NUH) has been referring selected patients from its Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs) to Frontier FMC. Linked up through a common Electronic Medical Record system, family physicians from Frontier FMC share and care these patients with their hospital colleagues, and meet regularly to jointly review their patients' care plans. Patients have benefited from this collaboration.",
            "One example is Mdm Ang Hwea Kee, an 86-year-old lady with multiple chronic conditions. Before her first visit at Frontier FMC in July 2013, she had been admitted four times in one year to NUH. The FMC primary care team has worked together with NUH specialists to care for her, including adjusting her medication doses when needed. Since her first visit to the FMC, she has not been re-admitted to NUH nor visited its emergency department.",
            "Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about our plans to enhance primary care services and work closely with the GP sector. We will continue to try out new care innovations to benefit patients. The FMC model is relatively new and we will continue to test it out. By the end of this year, we will open a seventh FMC at the upcoming Ci Yuan Community Club (CC) at Hougang Avenue 9.",
            "In addition, we have planned for a new primary care development at Sembawang. The Sembawang Primary Care Centre will be developed by a team from Alexandra Health System (AHS). It will be a test-bed for the introduction of new care models, innovative ideas and care processes.",
            "Among the CHCs, one of our CHCs adopts an innovative model of running on wheels and providing mobile services to residents living in Bishan-Toa Payoh, Hougang and Whampoa. With its pit stops at various Community Clubs and HDB car parks, patients are able to access services, such as diabetic foot screening nearer to their homes. Patients who have benefited include Mdm Sarasvathy d/o Rama Panickar, who has diabetes. With the Mobile CHC at Hougang Community Club, she can walk a short distance on her own to the CHC for her screening, and feel more independent.",
            "As Minister Gan Kim Yong mentioned, besides building a new polyclinic in Bukit Panjang, we are also redeveloping Yishun and Marine Parade polyclinics. These expansions will allow us to meet expected demand even as the population in the estate grows and ages. Yishun Polyclinic will be redeveloped at a permanent site at the junction of Yishun Central and Yishun Avenue 9 by 2018, and expanded. Marine Parade Polyclinic at Marine Parade Central will be expanded from its current single storey to two storeys by 2016. Construction of Jurong West and Punggol polyclinics will begin later this year.",
            "Whilst polyclinics remain an important part of our primary care system, our private GPs still provide the majority of primary care in Singapore. We have regularly enhanced CHAS since 2012, enabling us to leverage on the capabilities of GPs to expand our primary care network. Most recently in 2014, we opened up CHAS to all ages and further raised the monthly household income per person to $1,800.",
            "With the Pioneer Generation Package, all Pioneers will benefit from CHAS. This means that there are now 1.2 million Singaporeans eligible for CHAS, more than double from a year ago. Similarly, the number of CHAS GP and dental clinics has also increased, from about 800 to over 1,300 over the last year.",
            "I would like to reassure Mr Ang that measures have been put in place to prevent overcharging of CHAS and PG patients. Prices charged by private GPs differ from clinic to clinic and from patient to patient, depending on the patient's condition, treatment provided, medications prescribed and length of consult. It also depends on the pricing structure of GPs. But we expect CHAS GPs to price reasonably, bearing in mind CHAS patients are expected to be lower- to middle-income. MOH closely monitors CHAS claims submitted by clinics, and clinics will be called upon to account for any exceptional claims. CHAS GPs should make their charges transparent. We encourage patients to clarify charges and ask for itemised receipts if they are unclear.",
            "Together, the polyclinics, FMCs and CHAS clinics provide good quality, subsidised care to Singaporeans – close to their home. Today, over nine in 10 HDB dwellers live within 15 minutes, by public transport, of a polyclinic or CHAS clinic.",
            "To plan for future healthcare needs, quality manpower is also needed. We will do more to retain and train doctors within the primary care sector.",
            "We have been training more GPs with post-graduate qualifications, such as the Graduate Diploma of Family Medicine and Master of Medicine (Family Medicine). We need to better harness existing talents in the private sector. As part of our Family Physician (FP) development plan, we will offer funding support for selected candidates, to encourage more doctors to undergo post-graduate training in family medicine. This will allow us to raise the standards of Family Medicine training, and ensure a consistent supply pipeline of capable family doctors.",
            "So what is next for the primary care landscape? We have made progress in strengthening primary care and will continue to plan ahead and do more. We are looking at fostering stronger public-private partnerships and further integrate GPs into the national healthcare system, so that, together, polyclinic doctors and private GPs play an important role in providing primary care to meet our population's changing health needs.",
            "Ideas and initiatives will not be developed by MOH alone. Over the next few months, we will consult our stakeholders, including primary care doctors and patients, on what they envision as the desired primary care landscape for Singapore. We can then move on to our next phase of primary care development.",
            "Mr Chairman, I will now touch on how MOH will strengthen residential Intermediate and Long-Term Care (ILTC) services. Minister Gan spoke on improvements in rehabilitative care. One of the ways we are doing this is by expanding capacity for community hospitals. By 2020, we will more than double our community hospital beds through the building of four new community hospitals in Jurong, Yishun, Sengkang and Outram. Last December, we opened the new Changi General Hospital's and St Andrew's Community Hospital's Integrated Building. The Integrated Building not only provides additional capacity but also enables both hospitals to collaborate and develop new ways to treat and rehabilitate patients. The new model of care at the Integrated Building will focus on optimising patients' recovery to prepare them to transit back to the home.",
            "Our hospitals are also working with their community partners to better integrate inpatient rehabilitation services with those in the community.",
            "MOH is also looking into addressing nursing home availability. We are on track to increase our nursing home capacity by 70%, to 17,000 beds by 2020. We have just opened a new nursing home in Bukit Batok run by Renci, and will open another one in Yishun run by All Saints Home in April. By the end of the year, we hope to open three more nursing homes in Jurong West, Jurong East and Bishan.",
            "As our healthcare sector expands, along with an increase in Singaporeans' expectations, I agree with Ms Tin Pei Ling that we will need to ensure that the standards of care provision whether in the hospitals or in the primary care, or in the ILTC sector, continue to rise.",
            "One area that we have worked on is to establish appropriate standards of care in nursing homes. In 2013, we announced the development of a set of Enhanced Nursing Home Standards (ENHS) by an industry-led workgroup. The standards were finalised last year. To help nursing homes attain these standards, MOH has worked closely with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to provide support, for example, a guide on the details of the standards. AIC has also developed new courses in Advanced Care Planning and falls prevention for nursing care staff and supervisors in nursing homes. The standards will take effect this year.",
            "Providers will be given a one-year grace period before the standards are enforced from 2016. With these standards in place, patients and their families can be more assured that their well-being will be taken care of.",
            "To maintain high standards of care across different settings, MOH has also developed evidence-based guidelines to improve clinical practice. These guidelines aim to support good care outcomes and recommend the use of clinically effective treatments and were developed by professionals.",
            "In addition to raising standards of care at nursing homes, we have taken steps to ensure affordability of long-term care services for the elderly. Ms Lee Li Lian has asked if ElderShield and IDAPE will be reviewed. MOH is carefully studying options to enhance the current ElderShield product.",
            "We are mindful that we will be introducing MediShield Life at the end of 2015, and that it would not be best to introduce a new ElderShield insurance plan at the same time. We have taken other steps to ensure affordability of long-term care services for the elderly. For example, in 2012, we enhanced ILTC subsidies to raise subsidy levels and cover more middle-income households. We implemented the Pioneer Disability Assistance Scheme, or Pioneer DAS last year, where Pioneers with severe disability can receive $1,200 cash payouts a year.",
            "As Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor mentioned, we are growing our healthcare professional workforce to ensure that we can adequately support expansions in healthcare services. Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin was concerned about the potential impact of these changes in medical indemnity coverage for obstetricians on obstetrics services and has suggested that MOH provide post-retirement protection for these doctors as an assurance for them to continue their practice. There is also concern from the ground on whether this change will affect the supply of obstetricians.",
            "The insurer Medical Protection Society (MPS) is continuing to provide post-retirement protection for obstetricians by providing tail cover, which covers practitioners against any claims that may occur after the practitioner is no longer covered or has retired. This tail cover is available in five-year blocks for purchase. Also, the new premiums per year after the change in insurance cover will be lower. Currently, there are adequate numbers of obstetricians, including those in training, to ensure availability of obstetric services to the general public.",
            "There will be 60 to 70 new obstetricians graduating over the next five years to ensure a continuing supply of obstetric services. Notably, we have sufficient trained and experienced midwives with the capacity to deliver more babies in our restructured hospitals.",
            "MOH is discussing with professional leaders and other stakeholders how best to address this issue. MOH will also consider ways to work with relevant parties to minimise impact on services and expectant mothers.",
            "In closing, MOH is committed to strengthening our primary care and residential ILTC services, deepening our infrastructural capacity, while raising our healthcare standards and ensuring affordability of care.",

This can be credited to improvements in nutrition, healthcare advancements, disease prevention and health promotion. Our health promotion efforts are focused on effecting sustainable healthy habits in Singaporeans of all ages, and from all backgrounds. To Ms Ellen Lee's question, the main challenge in adopting healthy living is in translating knowledge to action. Hence, central to our approach is a greater emphasis on behaviour change, and not just public education. To do this, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has been engaging the community and private sector to understand their needs and motivations. This enables the HPB to implement relevant initiatives to effect behaviour change on the ground.",

Yet about one in two drink sweetened drinks every day. So, we want to bring healthier meals to children in school. HPB has been working with schools and post-Secondary Educational Institutions to provide healthy food choices in canteens. Stalls are encouraged to offer healthier options: increase vegetables and fruits in menus, reduce gravy and fried food. We will also link up suppliers with canteen vendors to offer wholegrain rice, noodles, bread, and healthier oils.",
            "Our children should have drinks with less or no sugar. Currently, only drinks with the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) are allowed in schools. HPB has been working with MOE to further reduce sugar content of drinks in vending machines and drink stalls. We aim to partner all schools in this effort by 1 January 2016.",
            "At the national level, we have introduced advertising guidelines so that our children are not constantly exposed to unhealthy food messaging. I urge parents to stand with us, by reinforcing healthy eating to your children at home.",
            "We aim to make healthier food choices the preferred choice for everyone. The HPB's Healthier Dining Programme works with 25 large-chain Food & Beverage partners, including McDonald's, Kopitiam, Swensen's and Dian Xiao Er, to offer 500-calorie meals through more than 700 food outlets and stalls. Swensen's observed that sales percentage of its six 500-calorie meals was about 15% in the three-month period after they were introduced.

I was quite delighted recently, when the drink stall gave me a Scratch n Win card because I ordered a drink with less sugar. I won a 50 cents rebate for the next \"healthy\" drink that I buy! I understand that prizes had ranged from this to $300 shopping vouchers.",
            "As many Singaporeans eat out, HPB has started a pilot scheme to work with suppliers to deliver healthier oil to food outlets, restaurant chains and volume caterers. HPB provides grants to help nudge the food outlets to adopt the healthier oil. HPB will review this scheme after a year. This is one example where HPB is willing to test out different ideas, to identify those which can lead to a sustained change in behaviours and habits.",

Mr Gerald Giam suggested that vaccines for pneumococcal disease should be fully subsidised. Since 2009, Medisave can be used for pneumococcal vaccine. Singaporean babies born on or after 26 August 2012 are given a Medisave grant of $3,000 that can be used to pay for vaccinations. Mr Giam would be pleased to know that following the introduction of these measures, our vaccination coverage with regard to pneumococcal in one-year-old children has increased significantly from 24.1% in 2009 to 75.4% in 2014. In absolute numbers, it means that the number of children who were vaccinated by the time they were one year old increased from 7,180 in 2009 to 23,000 children in 2014.",
            "Vaccines in the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) are fully subsidised at the polyclinics when there is a need to strongly encourage high take-up of vaccinations for highly infectious diseases. This is so that the community can develop immunity as a whole against the disease, and outbreaks are prevented. In the case of pneumococcal disease, the potential for a public health epidemic or outbreak is relatively low.",
            "Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked for an update on tobacco control. I feel that this is an important issue. We all know that smoking can seriously harm our health. In Singapore, it is the second most important cause of premature deaths and ill health.",
            "To quit smoking can be daunting, but it is certainly worth the effort. Quitting not only protects our own health, but also the health of our loved ones from exposure to second hand smoke. To facilitate smoking cessation, we have set up the \"I Quit\" campaign since 2011. It adopts a community-based yet personalised approach to build a network of support that helps smokers quit. This movement has reached 13,000 smokers through various platforms at the workplaces, hospitals, in the uniformed groups, and in the community. It has proved effective simply because it involves not just the smoker who wants to quit, but also support from his family and friends. In many cases, it has helped to bring the family closer together.",
            "67-year-old retiree Hanafi Bin Ismail had been smoking for almost 50 years. After suffering a heart attack, he decided to quit for both his health and his family. However, going from one pack of cigarettes a day to none was not easy, so Hanafi gradually cut down. Signing up for the Ramadan Challenge, he received encouragement through regular text messages. His children and grandchildren were supportive, and constantly reminded him of his commitment to quit. Today, Hanafi feels happier and healthier. Ever since he quit smoking, he exercises at least once a week – doing push-ups and even walking up to seven kilometres. His grandchildren are also much happier for him now.",
            "Our strategies to control smoking are multi-pronged. We want to reduce the advertising effect of point-of-sale displays, particularly on our youth. When tobacco products are no longer prominently displayed near the cashiers, it could decrease impulse purchases and help smokers trying to quit. This year, MOH will be banning point-of-display of tobacco through an amendment to the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act. There will be a 12-month grace period to provide retailers enough time to comply.",
            "While we are doing well compared to OECD countries, I worry that smoking rates are high among young men, and younger women are picking up the habit. Tobacco companies have been coming out with new tobacco products that appeal to the youth. We are concerned about the health risks of such products, and have been studying ways to address this growing trend. Shisha was the first emerging tobacco product to be banned in November last year, to prevent its proliferation and entrenchment in Singapore. We intend to do the same for other types of emerging tobacco products later this year. Compliance with the shisha ban has been good. My Ministry will continue to monitor the situation, and assess the full effect of the ban after the transitional period ends on 31 July 2016.",
            "Our efforts do not end here. We constantly scan the world for new ideas. For example, we have been studying developments in Australia, the world's first country to implement plain packaging. This requires tobacco products to be sold in drab green boxes, with graphic health warnings, the brand name in standardised typeface, and minus all corporate logos and trademarks.",
            "We will be conducting a public consultation on requiring the packaging of tobacco products to be standardised in Singapore, towards the end of this year. I would like very much to hear your views.",
            "In conclusion, Sir, I am pleased to say that we are making good progress. In the last six years, more Singaporeans have rated themselves in good overall health, more young adults are exercising regularly, and more than two-thirds of Singaporeans aged 40 to 60 years have regularly attended chronic disease health screening.",
            "Sir, I am also inspired and very pleased to see many groups, whether formal or informal groups, coming together to be part of this health promotion movement. I have met many groups who have been working together with organisations to see how we can facilitate and help in the movement of getting more Singaporeans to live healthily and to bring health promotion efforts towards fellow Singaporeans and on the ground.",
            "We hope to work towards a growing people's movement for good health over time and encourage more members to start similar movements in other parts of Singapore. Together, a healthy nation for all ages.",

            "Sir, ageing has certainly been much discussed, and rightly so, since our population is ageing fast and, come 2030, one in five amongst us will be above 65 years old. We can certainly take advantage of our increased longevity and make ageing a positive experience.",
            "Earlier, Minister Gan spoke about the Action Plan for Successful Ageing and shared Singaporeans' aspirations on how to age successfully. And some of these relate to lifelong employment and employability of our seniors. During our focus group discussions, many participants had said that they wanted to be able to work into their senior years, past the retirement age, and to have a chance and the choice to do so. Because, to them, employment brings greater financial security and also keeps our seniors meaningfully occupied and mentally active. Also, work gives a sense of fulfilment and self-worth.",
            "Ms Ellen Lee asked how we will help seniors stay healthy longer so that they can remain employed and employable. We are investing in health promotion for seniors in two ways.",
            "First, within the community, we started the Wellness Programme in 2008 and it has since been implemented nationwide. The Wellness Programme encourages seniors to look after their health, as well as to stay physically active and socially connected. As at the end of last year, the programme has outreached to some 400,000 seniors.",
            "In addition, we are also bringing health promotion to workplaces so that we can also address the needs of our mature workers within the workplaces. In 2014, two pilot programmes were started: one in the transport industry and one in the cleaning sector. I will give a quick update on the two programmes.",
            "First, within the transport industry – taxi drivers. Taxi drivers often sit for long hours as they drive their taxis around during the shift and, because of that, being sedentary, there is little opportunity for physical exercise. So, in June last year, the Health Promotion Board, together with Alexandra Health System, partnered with Comfort DelGro and the SMRT, supported by the National Taxi Association, and started a workplace health pilot for drivers who are aged 40 and above.",
            "They brought health programmes to the taxi service centres, such that drivers can get \"one for one\" service. What happens is that, every month, the taxi driver will have to bring his taxi in for servicing and he has to wait a couple of hours pending the car being serviced. So, making use of that free time as he waits for the taxi, the driver can participate in health promotion programmes at the service centre.",
            "Under this programme, taxi drivers undergo health screenings, followed by individualised health coaching sessions where they learn how to improve their health, like exercising more regularly in the hours that they are not driving, as well as adopting a more healthy diet.",
            "The drivers also learn about the ergonomics of driving, like how to adopt the right posture while driving. Car decals are also given to our taxi drivers to remind them on how, even while seated, they might be able to do certain minor stretches. Together, these efforts will help reduce work-related injury or discomfort, a concern that Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef had also mentioned.",
            "Preliminary results of this pilot have been encouraging. To date, we have screened some 3,000 taxi drivers, of whom, more than 90% of them have since followed up with health coaching sessions.",
            "The next one would be on the cleaning sector. The second group that has been reached out to are mature cleaners. In September last year, through the network of the Building Construction and Timber Industries Employees' Union (BATU), we worked with a cleaning company RamkyCleantech to implement a workplace health programme for mature cleaners working at the Singapore Polytechnic. Under that programme, cleaners undergo health screenings and learn how to manage their chronic conditions. They also learn how to improve work habits for better pain management, especially of the joints.",
            "More than 60% of the 180 cleaners are now attending the coaching sessions regularly and participating in activities to strengthen their muscles and to lower the risk of falls.",
            "Sir, so what I wanted to say is that there is something about these two pilots. What we do with the mature workers in the two industries will be different because the nature of the work is different – one is sedentary and one involves a lot of joint movements. So, therefore, whilst mature workers are likely to have common challenges like chronic diseases, but because of the nature of their work, they may also face health challenges that are specific to their work. This is something we take note of in customising programmes for our mature workers.",
            "Given the encouraging results of the pilots, we will extend workplace health programmes to other sectors and we are looking at retail and security for 2015. Workplace health is a meaningful area of tripartite collaboration. Workers benefit if they stay healthy longer and have the means to work longer, and concurrently save on healthcare cost by staying healthy. Employers also benefit, because mature workers who can work longer means additional manpower and being more healthy, they are certainly going to be more productive at work as well. As a whole, our nation benefits when we convert longer life years into longer healthy and productive ones."

I shared earlier about small informal groups interested in the health movement. We also want to thank them for playing a part.",
            "But let me go back to share with you some of the data that we have. For example, if we look at smoking, between 1992 and 2013, our adult smoking prevalence improved from 18.3% to 13.3%. We see a downward trend. Another trend that we can see is also smoking rates amongst young adults aged 18 to 29 years are lower than among all adults – 12.7% and 13.3%. This possibly is attributable to the intensified intervention, targeting young adults at the Institutions of Higher Learning and also National Service training camps. Things are showing effect.",
            "With regards to obesity, we can see that our rates seem to indicate that it has stabilised, although it increased from 6.0% in 1998 to 10.8% in 2010, but we have another survey which we did in 2013, a similar one, but a little bit different methodology, showed that the rate has gone down to 8.6%.

We must be careful in terms of the amount of saturated fats that we take. In terms of physical activity, during leisure time, it has also increased where Singaporeans of younger ages are spending more time on exercising.",
            "I am very passionate about this issue! Lastly, screening. We can do more for cardiovascular risk factors and cancer. But for the proportion of Singaporeans who go for screening in cancer, colorectal cancer has increased from 26.8% to 33.8% in 2011 and 2013. Similarly, for mammogram, we also saw an increase.",

For the first clarification, I am very happy to hear all the developments in the upgrading and new polyclinics that we can look forward to. But it seems that a lot of these improvements will only be operational in a few years' time. Given that we do recognise that our polyclinics are already operating at near to full capacity, what steps will the Ministry be taking to make sure that the primary care needs of Singaporeans continue to be served in the interim?",
            "The second clarification is related is to the point that was raised by hon Member Mr Ang Wei Neng about overcharging in primary care with CHAS, PG and all these schemes. Are there any measures to perhaps look at over-consumption? An example has been reported recently, where some people raised concerns that with the coming of CHAS and the PG package, there has been a sharp rise in the frequency of dental visits by some seniors.",
            "The last clarification is a short one. It is with regards to the Flexi-Medisave Scheme. When it was first announced, the Ministry said that they would open it to public feedback and they will try and see whether they can fine-tune the scheme before its launch in April this year. I was wondering whether there have been any changes to that scheme."

            "I do understand Dr Chia's concern and also that of many fellow Singaporeans. Indeed, polyclinic attendance and waiting times are important indicators that MOH is monitoring very closely. We acknowledge that we need to increase polyclinic capacity and thus, we have committed to building four more polyclinics by 2020 and a further six to eight polyclinics by 2030. In the meantime, there are existing 18 polyclinics across the island and they will continue to serve Singaporeans while these polyclinics are being built.",
            "At the same time, MOH is also redeveloping Marine Parade, Bedok, Yishun and Ang Mo Mio polyclinics where the attendance at these places has been noted to be on the high side. In addition to that, MOH will continue to work actively with private GPs to explore new models of care including enhancing CHAS, developing more CHCs as well as FMCs.",
            "With this combined, polyclinic and CHAS GP network, in fact, nine in 10 HDB residents are within 15 minutes commute time from the polyclinic or any CHAS GP. MOH will continue to work with other non-CHAS GPs to see how we can encourage more of them to participate in the CHAS programme, thereby widening the primary care network."

After we announced it some time ago, we went to get feedback, consulted and engaged the GPs on how to roll this out, especially CHAS GPs. We have also got feedback from polyclinics and SOCs as well, who will be involved. The feedback generally is very positive. Patients like it because it gives them more flexibility. But, of course, they hope not just $200 but more. That is to be expected. We need to tread very carefully. On the one hand, we want to give flexibility to our patients but on the other hand, we have to make sure that they have sufficient savings, and that they preserve their savings for the longer term retirement needs.",
            "From hospitals and the GPs, there was some feedback. Because some of these claims may be very small in nature, so some of the GPs may feel that they are not equipped to handle individual cases of claims for small amounts. Therefore, some of the GPs said that they would need more time. As we roll out, they will come on board the programme later on.",

But, beyond that, there are other factors that we recognise – people may feel discomfort and also the issue of privacy. The Senior Minister of State, Dr Amy Khor, is working very hard together with her team to see we can deepen our engagement and make people go to the area where we can facilitate them to come forward in doing this. The more people coming forward, the better it is; the earlier you get to know what is wrong with you, the better we can diagnose and we can help you to manage it.",
            "The second issue is about smoking. Like what I had mentioned, for smoking, we take a multi-pronged approach. Why we do smoking cessation programmes is because we care for fellow Singaporeans. We know the ill effects of smoking. It is not about not allowing them to smoke but I think we see day after day on how death can be prevented if one stops smoking and not only for oneself but also for the family members.",

It is not only to the smokers themselves but it also goes beyond that, to the family members, to the community. I remember meeting a friend who smoked. When he stopped smoking, the whole family celebrated. We want to see how we can celebrate this because we care for one another.

This is a significant improvement from 2013, which was about 30-odd days. As I have said in my speech, we are ramping up capacity very rapidly. Over the last four years, we have increased the number of day-care places by 1,000 and we are on track to increase the number of day-care places to 6,200 by 2020. Whilst they are waiting for day-care places, the hospitals could assist in terms of referring them for interim caregiver service or transitional care service. In order to further ramp up capacity, as I have said, we are also ramping up homecare. So, an alternative really would be homecare services.",

In terms of quality, there is a palliative care guideline which we are finalising and it will be used as a developmental guideline and to improve and enhance service. And also in terms of capacity, we are expanding capacity both in home palliative care as well as inpatient palliative care beds. In terms of affordability, we further expanded the use of Medisave for palliative care to reduce the patients' cash payment upfront. So, withdrawal limits have been increased and lifetime limits for terminal cancer or end-stage organ failure have been removed for home palliative care. Where it is the family members who pay, the life time limit has been increased.

          "content": [
            ": Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".",
            "Sir, at last year's Committee of Supply debate, Minister Chan Chun Sing shared his three-pronged vision to mobilise agencies upstream to integrate social service delivery and to invest in the next generation of social service leaders and professionals.",
            "I applaud the Ministry for its great work, especially in launching the network of some 20 Social Service Offices (SSOs) across the island. I have the privilege of working with very good SSOs in my constituency and District.",
            "Sir, I would like to highlight three key restraining forces that can stand in the way of a strong 21st-century social service sector in Singapore, and provide some suggestions for consideration.",
            "One, the size and nature of the landscape. Singapore's social service landscape is dotted by several key Government agencies, such as the MSF, NCSS, SG-Enable and more than 400 voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs), serving some 400,000 clients yearly. The number of VWOs is growing by the day, with many passionate and capable persons raring to start projects or organisations of their own.",
            "At the same time, the Ministry is, on the other hand, doing its level best to streamline the services, \"rein-in\" the volunteers so that they would \"hunt as a pack\", in the Minister's words, for the sake of their beneficiaries.",
            "Sir, the balance is difficult to maintain. Too much of control and command and \"cookie-cutter\" solutions deprive the sector of its much-needed innovation, creativity and passion. Too little control leads to over-serving, under-serving or not serving particular groups in need.",
            "With trends such as an increasing number of elderly people living on their own; increasing income and digital gaps between those who are more affluent and those less, a single Ministry's outreach efforts are still limited. In fact, each of the Ministries is also now conducting its own efforts in public consultation, policy communications, as can be seen in the many MOF Pioneer Generation, MOH MediShield Life, Silver Support and other efforts all hitting the same ground. I have several suggestions.",
            "Sir, against this backdrop, I fear that the underlying structure of SSOs will not be sufficient to address the social challenges of the future and have two suggestions in this regard.",
            "One, on Municipal Services Office. There needs to be a community-centric Municipal Services Office of sorts, an integrator that works across Ministries to study both strategic and ground need and co-ordinate the many services, needs and players to align to the target beneficiaries on the ground. The landscape of SSOs, WDAs, VWOs, grassroots, FSCs, not to mention the CDCs, is not optimal and can be confusing.",
            "Two, on the tiered approach to partnering VWOs. Sir, the Ministry has also spent much time to strengthen the smaller partner VWOs in the sector, creating more and more hubs and centralised programmes to support them.",
            "But it is also important not to lose the support and strengths of the bigger players in the sector. The Ministry should harness the experience, networks and energies of the larger players and nurture them, in the way that MTI is working with and incentivising larger SMEs to support the smaller ones. MSF should tier its treatment of the social service players; help those with a track record to build centres of excellence; partner them to use their expertise for their financial independence; understand their challenges better and support them. One example is the additional costs of internal audits that the Charity Governance guidelines expect bigger players to install, which have to be funded from donations.",
            "As they say, big vision can come with big problems; small vision, small problems; and no vision, no problem. The Ministry should not ignore the bigger players, their vision and their bigger problems.",
            "In this regard, I propose that the MSF build a consulting arm with the right expertise in both social and business sectors and the ability to nurture the different levels of players in the social service sector.",
            "Next, on rising public expectations and citizen participation. In the face of many great social challenges of our century are great expectations of the public that Government must deliver more, faster and cheaper. I was once told that the mobile phone expenses are now essential items and should be considered in the computation of financial assistance for those in need. I also hear of challenges to the assumptions and principles underlying Singapore's social service programmes. Should the family still be the first port of call for a parent, a child or a sibling in need? Or should the latter be considered a citizen in his own right and is entitled to state subsidies, regardless of how affluent his immediate family is?",
            "Sir, MSF has to find better ways of citizen participation to identify and validate the real prioritised needs and pains on the ground; to discuss underlying values and rationales behind policies and trade-offs. It can also find ways in the landscape to have most lasting and sustainable ways, especially of individual citizen participation, instead of the",
            "ad hoc",
            "do-good efforts in the form of CSR and CIP involvements.",
            "Suggestions: One, develop a strategic communications plan, much like \"Our Singapore Conversations\". Go deeper in understanding and validating ground needs on a regular basis. Adopt a beneficiary-centric programme rather than a Ministry-centric way of communicating social service programmes from the whole-of-government. Use technology to conduct crucial dialogues and to share Government social service policies and programmes, in their language and in their preferred modes.",
            "Two, develop a strategic citizen participation blueprint for a more structured and visible way to match willing hearts and hands and Sector needs.",
            "Third, on big social challenges of the 21st century. The American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare had prompted a series of programmes under the umbrella of \"Grand Challenges\" to facilitate deep dialogues on social challenges. The series seeks to identify pressing social issues and bigger and bolder ideas to meet existing and emerging demands facing the community in the coming decade.",
            "Some of the challenges are similar to what we face in Singapore – growing income inequality, ageing population, low birth rates, values in transition, and those pertaining to 21st century trends, such as online gambling and mental wellness.",
            "Many of these big social changes need solutions that are outside the purview and knowledge base of the Ministry and social service sector. A lot of these cannot be solved by Government or money alone. It takes a village.",
            "Suggestions: One, start a \"Grand Social Challenges\" Series to seek bold and out-of-box ideas. Better still, leverage on the Social Science Research Council announced by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman announced last night at Ngee Ann Kongsi's 170th anniversary. More importantly, let me add a caveat to remember to include the voices of the people on the ground, especially the practitioners and the target beneficiaries.",

            ": Mr Chairman, I spoke last week on the importance of a social service sector that is sustainable. I fully agree with what was spoken by the hon Member Ms Denise Phua and I would like to just share three more factors which I feel are also important for consideration.",
            "One, manpower. The sector also faces a crucial crunch, just like any other sector, in the availability of suitably qualified professionals. Whilst we appreciate that the Government is taking active steps to ramp up the supply of such professionals, the fact remains that in the interim, we are not able to serve as many beneficiaries as is needed.",
            "The sector recognises that we have to play our part in the management and nurturing of our human resources in order to retain and develop them, but the fact remains that we do not have the ability to attract and remunerate the professionals and pay them as competitively as we would like. While there are schemes from Government to assist the VWOs, the schemes are often short term and do not permit us to make long-term plans.",
            "As such, I would like to ask the Minister whether there are plans to further train locals, whether locally or foreign, and whether we are going to have plans to arrange for them to have internship. What other financial assistance can be extended to the VWOs in order that we might be able to attract and retain talent competitively. More importantly, and also for the long term, how can we equip the social service VWOs to be able to nurture and manage their human resources to retain and to develop them for the sector?",
            "Secondly, the change of mindsets. We need to change the mindset that VWOs should only always be run like charities. There is actually nothing wrong with running programmes that generate revenue as long as we do not lose focus of our mission, we do not neglect the needy and as long as we remain beneficiary-centric. Profit, of course, cannot be the overriding factor in our service but we cannot run and say profit is not important. Can the Government assure us that when we undertake programmes and explore ways to generate revenue, the VWOs would be able to still retain their charity status and their IPC status? In this respect also, can the Government help to equip the sector to generate our own revenue?",
            "The third point relates to greater collaboration between Ministries and VWO. We can barely, scarcely afford to have VWOs operate in silo or on a territorial basis or for Ministries to operate as if they were running their own Ministries alone. We welcome the Social Service Net and Social Service Offices and we hope to see more of such measures to stimulate, facilitate the service delivery and for greater and better follow through of all the services within the sector.",

            ":I would like to highlight two issues that I have raised several times before, the first being the need to enhance competitiveness of the social service sector by ensuring our social service professionals are paid a salary commensurate to the hard work that they do. The second is that more resources should be disbursed to our social service providers to ensure they are well-equipped to carry out their work.",
            "In 2012 the Ministry set a target of 8% average increase in wages in the social service sector and up to 15% wage increase for social workers. The Government also provided assurance that salary increases would continue periodically as the Ministry conducts regular benchmarking of social service sector pay to the similar jobs in the market. I would like to seek an update from the Minister on the current salary scheme of social service professionals, in particular, one, since 2012 how many Government-funded VWOs have raised staff wages by an average of 8%? Two, how many social workers have seen the 15% wage increase since 2012? Thirdly, would the Ministry provide details on the benchmarking exercise that has been conducted since 2012, in particular, which jobs have the Ministry used as benchmarks and why? What is the wage differential between social work and these other jobs? Has the wage differential narrowed over the past three years; and if so, by how much?",
            "In addition, I would like to ask the Ministry to enhance its funding and support to social service providers. Social service providers are the intermediaries between the Government and citizens. As such, it is important for social service providers to receive adequate funding and support. On this, I would like to ask how much has MSF done in the recent years enhancing the funding and support given to the social services.",

            "Furthermore, our Government has actually increased our subsidies for childcare for working parents. I would like to know whether the operators are indeed using the higher subsidies to defray their operating costs? Or is it a case whereby whenever there is an increase in Government subsidies, this will translate into higher fee adjustments?",
            "How does the Ministry therefore ensure that a larger share is being channelled to raise the wages of pre-school teachers or to send their teachers for professional development? Are the subsidies also being used to, say, enhance the curriculum and the content of the quality of teaching in the childcare centres.",
            "As announced in this year's Budget, parents with young children will benefit from more affordable and quality childcare through a new programme called the Partner Operator (POP) scheme. This will require childcare operators to commit to quality improvements, and keep fees within reach. Can MSF share more details of the scheme and whether it will benefit our early childhood professionals as well?",

And I am concerned about what are the plans of the Ministry to increase recruitment and retention for pre-school teachers.",
            "The second issue I would like to bring up is the issue of the Anchor Operators Scheme and the New Partner Operators Scheme with respect to Mother Tongue Language provision. There is quite a lot of effort put into the provision of Mother Tongue Language teaching in primary schools so that our primary schools provide an environment where children of all backgrounds get an opportunity to mix and socialise and learn about each other, and this may be as important in the pre-school sector in bringing on board new partners and in developing the Anchor Operators Scheme. What is the Ministry doing to assist the provision of Mother Tongue Languages across all four Mother Tongues in the pre-school sector?",

            "(1) Where feasible, old Government buildings or purpose-built facilities can be made available to be mega pre-school centres, housing different operators under one roof. There can be shared facilities such as a large hall, common kitchen, and outdoor play and game areas.",
            "(2) Promote the use of external central kitchens, so centres do not need their own kitchens and cooks, and can buy cooked food from such suppliers.",
            "(3) Encourage centres to form economic grouping with common resources such as curriculum, enrichment programmes and back office support. The degree of such sharing can be up to different operators, as some will want partial differentiation in curriculum for branding. We can devise schemes to encourage economic grouping to have better sectoral productivity and higher quality curriculum.",
            "(4) Have common resources purchased by the Ministry for loan, such as costlier but useful learning resources, puppets and props for annual plays which pre-schools will usually need. When visiting Australia many years ago, I noted that the state provides such shared resources for loans. These resources can be kept with a lead pre-school centre within a geographical area to manage on behalf of the cluster.",

            ": Sir, the challenge to meet the high demand for affordable childcare services continues to be a major concern faced by parents. Good childcare services are integral to the development of a child in a pre-school stage, especially in our society where both parents are working. It is certainly one of the factors that they will consider when they do family planning.",
            "To increase affordability of childcare services, it is time to look into placing a cap on the fees they are charged, otherwise each time the Government increases the grants, the operator will seize the opportunity to up their charges. Parents do not benefit.",
            "The shortage of skilled childcare teachers and childminders remains a thorny issue. If we do not attract sufficient talent, efforts to boost the infrastructure will not pay off. We must first explore the reasons, the interest, and what discourage potential candidates from making a career in a pre-school industry. A committee should be set up to engage the pre-school industry and analyse the situation.",
            "In Australia which is also tackling a problem of pre-school educator shortage, they find that a lack of social support is one of the major reasons. Teachers suffered from stress and burnout due to the long working hours and the mediocre pay and there were insufficient colleagues who are skilled and qualified to provide mutual support, advice and assistance. They found peer support, mentoring and professional network to be successful strategies.",
            "Additionally, there should be an official support network for pre-school educators who may get together to share ideas, support one another and, more importantly, have a collective voice to push for improvements to the sector.",
            "Finally, Singaporeans must recognise the professionalism of pre-school educators. Better salaries and more incentives are certainly the way to go but there is more to it than money. Pre-school teachers are not nannies and our society needs to understand that they do more than take care of children. They are setting the cornerstones at a child's most vulnerable stage of learning where anything he or she learns is easily soaked up, like water by sponge. They deserve more appreciation and recognition.",
            "At this juncture, I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Minister that there is an acute shortage of childcare centres in Nee Soon South. At every MPS, I have parents who come to seek help. In the last MPS alone, there were about a dozen of parents who came to seek help. Therefore, I would like to urge the Minister to build more childcare centres in Nee Soon, especially in Nee Soon South.",

            ": Sir, about 200 pre-school and childcare centres are being rolled out by the Ministry to meet demand for pre-school and childcare places. However, the challenge is not in making space for or funding the setting up of the centres. Rather, it is in identifying and training qualified pre-school teachers and educarers with the right qualities to helm the centres and care for the children.",
            "In an earlier Parliamentary Question, Minister for Social and Family Development confirmed that the attrition rate of pre-school qualified teachers is rather high, at about half of those who are trained. Raising the salaries of pre-school teachers and educarers is one way to attract more to join and stay in the profession. While the salaries of pre-school teachers have generally increased, many leave the anchor operator centres because they are lured by higher salaries offered by certain high-end pre-schools or other industries that pay better.",
            "To retain pre-school teachers and educarers, there must be clear professional development pathways for them, such as training opportunities, professional-sharing sessions and recognition for doing so, as well as opportunities and funding support to present at international conferences or publish papers in journal space on their classroom experience.",
            "I see that, increasingly, pre-school teachers in our anchor operator pre-schools undergo professional development training on a regular basis. However, would MSF consider setting aside a research or practitioner fund for our pre-school teachers to embark on practitioner research to strengthen classroom practice and be given time and resources to pursue this? Thereafter, the research carried out by them can be recognised for job promotion or advance pre-school skills certification.",
            "I am heartened by the Minister's reply to my earlier PQ that the traineeship programme for early childhood will be broadened to consider recruiting stay-at-home mothers, mid-career entrants and retirees. I hope that the SkillsFuture credit and SkillsFuture Earn and Learn programme can be twinned with the traineeship programme so that even more can be attracted to this profession, be sufficiently trained and gain sufficient experience to stay on as pre-school teachers and edu-carers.",

As parents, we must see our pre-school teachers and edu-carers as our partners and work closely with them. As a society, I hope we are able to recognise that for our pre-school teachers and edu-carers they are in the profession out of choice, and because they have the interest and passion to teach and care for our children.",

            "These childcare operators received Government grants in exchange for keeping their fees affordable and need the Ministry's approval to raise their fees. Would the Ministry consider requiring such operators to provide an itemised breakdown of their fee increases? This would be akin to the requirement that CASE made to Shell last month when they did not accept the oil company's vague reasons for raising petrol prices because of the petrol tax rise announced at this year's Budget. CASE noted that the explanation was not acceptable and that Shell did not provide CASE with a breakdown of the cost increases beyond the rise in petrol tax.",

In comparison, there have been far weaker efforts for student care in these same areas. Staff training is not mandatory and the range of courses and number of training providers are far fewer for student care.",

Fortunately, student care operating hours tend to be short, with most opened only in the afternoons as most schools are single sessions. There is scope to attract mothers who may wish to return to the workforce but want shorter work hours. We can target this group with training grants and incentives to join the sector. With more trained staff, we can hopefully increase the pace of more SSCs.",

            "However, not every person is suitable for employment. There may be some who may be more suitable for self-employment and, perhaps, the Ministry could also look into specific or more streamlined schemes to help persons with disabilities on a micro-finance basis for them to run their own little cottage businesses. I requested for this to address both cuts together as one because I feel that the issue on employability is not just one that relates to the Open Door Programme and on and so forth alone, but it is one that involves too many sectors, too many Ministries, too many agencies.",
            "Overall, the public education and the public perception is very, very important. When we look at a person with disability, there is always a concern and a fear that if I employ someone who has a different need, I may have different challenges in having to absorb that person into my employment, into my workforce. If we are able to have public initiatives – public education initiatives – and share with employers what they can do and what they do not have to do, I think it would help a lot.",
            "There have been many conferences that had been organised but very often, I think, we are just preaching to the converted. How do we reach out to those who are not attending the conferences because these are the ones we need to reach out to? Perhaps the trade associations; perhaps all the other schools, the institutions can help us. What we need to do is to equip a child from young to be employable, to be a part of a bigger community. What we need to do is to be able to train and expose young children, from the time that they are young, to children with disabilities so that they will grow up together with them as one. And when they become colleagues and when they become bosses or superiors in due course, there will be a less of an awkwardness.",
            "That would be, the long-term plan, but in the short term, what can we do? Can we have more national education initiatives starting from schools, in the trade associations, in the commercial sectors and even in the social service sector? Very often, we train people with skills and we equipped them with soft skills to go into the workforce, but is the take-up rate not as satisfactory? Why is it not the way we have hoped? On the one hand, we have people who say, \"I want to work\", on the other hand, we have people who say, \"I want to employ\". Why can we not find the match? There has got to be something that is missing in between. Is it perhaps a lack or an inadequacy in the way we are training our people? Is it an inadequacy in the exposure of potential employers?",
            "If Ministry could work with the relevant agencies and look into more of these issues at a more specific level, I think we would be much better able to grasp the issues. And I raise this even though I am from SPD. I must say that we really do not have the answers. We feel that it has got to be driven at a much higher level because this has got to be done from different Ministries at different levels. And I also, at this point, urge that the Government, as the largest employer, leads by example as well. If you show to the employers out there that you can and you do employ persons with disabilities because you are able to train them and because you believe in their potential as well. Thank you.",

            "One of the findings in the report addresses the need to fill the notable service gap after persons with special needs leave school at age 18. Issues brought up include limited vacancies at day activity centres and range of care options to cater for different needs. The report made an interesting suggestion to open up the many conveniently located eldercare facilities to adults with special needs so as to reduce transport costs, reduce travelling time and to enable these adults to go to the centres on their own if possible since eldercare facilities are conveniently located in the heartlands.",
            "Many of the eldercare facilities, especially the senior activity centres, have the capacity to do more since the premises are already equipped with elderly and handicapped-friendly features. These neighbourhood facilities can conduct classes and activities for these adults with special needs some of whom could be highly functional.",
            "I wish to ask the Minister for an update on this suggestion to be put forth in the Enabling Masterplan. How many eldercare facilities have piloted such initiative and what type of support the Ministry is providing to these centres to take on the added role of providing care for adults with special needs?",
            "Sir, I prefer to use the term \"adults with special needs\" instead of \"adults with disabilities\" for good reason. Many years ago, while on a train overseas, I chanced upon a person in a motorised wheelchair in the same cabin where I was seated. The person has limited mobility and he was alone. The conductor came, asked the passenger a few questions, unzipped the person's waist pouch, took out a note, issued the ticket and put everything, including the change, back into the person's pouch. Do I see a person with disabilities? All I saw that day was an independent person with special needs going about his life living in an inclusive society. Thank you.",

I am glad that today, we have had progress in the areas of paternity leave as well as help and benefits for single mothers. Yet, while paternity and maternity leave have been extended to single parents, a heartening change, there are still privileges that single unwed mothers are not entitled to, including the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, Child Development Account, the Parenthood tax rebate, and various tax reliefs.",

Single mothers are only entitled to eight weeks of paid maternity leave. Single fathers are not entitled to paternity leave at all.",

            "Yet today I speak with somewhat a heavy heart. I believe that a good policy is one that has moral weight but not one that places a difficult moral burden on those seek to help. The scheme is generous: $60,000 in Housing Grant paid out over 20 years; $1,000 in utilities; $6,000 in training incentives; $10,000 for employment incentives and $3,000 annual bursaries for children. Yet, in two recent encounters. The scheme has come with a moral burden. The scheme requires families to have no more than two children. Let me share just one case to illustrate this point.",
            "I met Mdm A at my MPS, she had just moved into my town, and needed some financial help as her husband had just lost his job. She needed a childcare place for her daughter as well. I thought, \"Okay – a straight-forward case\". We have many available interim schemes to help them. But then, she added that she believed that she was three to four months pregnant, but had not seen a gynaecologist. She was afraid of the cost and was considering aborting the child. She had lost two previous children and went into depression.",
            "Over the next two weeks, my team and I made numerous phone calls and a gynaecologist, a paediatrician and even a private hospital stepped forward, volunteered to care for her and her child free-of-charge. We kept up contact with Mdm A but she waivered, somewhat hesitant. Then, in the phone call she said the reason is because \"I am afraid to lose hope\". I was confused slightly by the statement, until I realised that it was not so much the cost of raising the child she was afraid, but the cost of losing the HOPE scheme.",
            "Never did I imagine that those words would be so impactful – \"afraid to lose HOPE\". Tried as we did, she quietly went for an abortion. Yes, we could say that the family could have practised better family planning. But what if families do have another child? This was the child that she shared she really, really wanted. How many children have we potentially lost? How can we better improve the scheme that was set up to provide hope – not take it away?",

The last update that Minister gave to this House was that an average of 300 families have joined the HOPE scheme in the last five years, on average, and about 3,000 families have benefited since 2004. This is but a small portion of needy families. Is there more that can be done to expand the scheme and remove the painful moral burden that it places on families already saddled by many challenges.",
