asked
the Minister for Transport (a) with the sharp drop in oil prices, why are the public transport operators allowed to raise their fares; (b) how much will these operators benefit from the fall in oil prices; and (c) why are these operators not absorbing the 2.8% increase carried over from 2014 given that they are running profitably.
:
Madam, with your permission, may I take Question Nos 1 and 2 together, please?
:
Yes, please.
: Mdm Speaker, fare adjustments are guided by the fare adjustment formula and process recommended by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee (FRMC) and was accepted by the Government in 2013. The formula is pegged to changes in the Core Consumer Price Index, Wage Index and Energy Index over the preceding year, less 0.5% for productivity gains. The Core Consumer Price Index and the Wage Index constitute 40% each of the fare formula. The Energy Index, constitute the remaining 20%.
The formula broadly reflects the operating cost structure for the public transport operators. The Fare Review Mechanism Committee had also recommended that fare review exercises be conducted annually. This is so that commuters do not have to endure a sudden, large fare adjustment after a few years. This formula and process for fare adjustment is valid for five years, until 2017, and we will review it again thereafter.
Er Dr Lee has asked how the recent 2.8% fare increment was derived and why fares were increased despite the sharp drop in oil prices. Er Dr Lee will recall that the full fare adjustment quantum considered by the Public Transport Council (PTC) in the 2013 fare review exercise was actually 6.6%. So, they considered 6.6% for the 2013 fare review exercise. But the PTC was mindful of the impact of a large fare increase on commuters, and so, the Council decided to grant only a 3.2% increase, or less than half of the 6.6% increase.
The remaining 3.4% was carried over to the fare review exercise for 2014. If you add this 3.4% to the negative 0.6% for the 2014 fare adjustment quantum, we therefore get a total fare adjustment quantum of 2.8% for the 2014 fare review exercise. In short, the current fare increase was due to the carry-over from the last exercise and the fall in oil prices in 2013 helped to mitigate this.
The continued fall in oil prices in 2014 and the start of this year will generate some cost savings for the transport operators. I should point out, however, that energy costs comprise about 20% of the operating costs for the sector, which is why the Energy Index is only 20% of the fare formula. Other costs, which include salaries for bus drivers and other public transport workers, account for the remaining 80%, and these have continued to experience upward pressure. We also expect operating costs to go up when higher operating standards come into effect from 2016. Notwithstanding this, overall, we are likely to see a negative fare adjustment of about 1% for the fare review exercise in 2015, because the energy costs have come down significantly in 2014. The 2015 fare adjustment that we will do at the end of this year, will take into account all the indices of 2014.
When deciding the fare adjustment, the Public Transport Council also has to ensure that the overall public transport system remains financially viable. Er Dr Lee has asked if the public transport operators could absorb the fare increase out of their profits. The fact is that operating buses and trains is not a highly profitable business; far from it.
In fact, of all the profits that are generated, roughly about 95% comes from the non-fare business, and at most 5% comes from operating trains and buses. Only in the recent quarters have fare revenue and income crept marginally above costs. Operators, however, need to make profits, for example, to pay for future capital expenditure. In a previous Sitting of this Parliament and in reply to a supplementary question from Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, I mentioned that SMRT has significant future capital commitments from now to 2019, somewhere in the region of $2 billion. We spoke about that. From now to 2019, SMRT has significant future capital commitments in the region of $2 billion. How do we put this $2 billion in context? Well, it is more than three times the cumulative profits that it has made in the last five financial years.
The most important thing is to re-assure Members of this House and the commuting public that the Government is committed to ensuring that public transport fares always remain affordable. In this regard, it is worth noting that households have generally been spending a smaller proportion of their income on public transport over the last 10 years – a point I have made in previous Committee of Supply debates and I will again show this in the coming COS debate in March.
In addition, during fare exercises, special attention is paid to vulnerable groups, such as senior citizens, persons with disabilities and lower-wage workers. For this year, fares will remain unchanged for these groups of commuters in the April fare exercise, and generally the fares for more than 1.1 million commuters will be held constant.
:
Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and patience. The fact is that whenever there is a fare review, it attracts a lot of discussion amongst residents. The fact is that the companies, the operators are allowed to do business beyond bus and trains, and so, residents expect them to cross-subsidise. The fact is that both SBS Transit and SMRT recently reported huge jump in profits – if I remember correctly, SBS Transit reported 27.8% jump in 2014 profit and SMRT 58.4% increase in Q3 profit. Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister to seriously consider the fare review formula. Can this formula include profitability instead of just about operating cost? And can the review of the formula be brought forward, instead of waiting until 2017?
: Mdm Speaker, let me thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for her passion and for championing these various areas. Indeed, there is a certain amount of cross-subsidy that is taking place. Even for SBS Transit, if you have seen the recent results for the whole of FY2014, the buses continue to make a loss. The reason the company remains profitable – and I will come to the profit figures in a while – is because of the other income that they have managed to generate as a result of rentals, commercial operations and so on.
For SBS Transit, the profit for the whole year increased from about $11 million-plus to $14 million-plus. In percentage terms, very high; but in terms of absolute numbers, measured against total revenue for the year of about $1 billion, you really see that the profit margin is about 1.5%. The profit margin for SMRT for the past FY – their FY ends only in March 2015 and it would not be appropriate for me to speculate what the final quarter's figures are – the profit margin for SMRT was 5%. As I had mentioned before, this was largely due to the revenue and profits that they generate from their non-fare business – commercial operations, rentals, taxis and so on. SMRT, you may recall, had been losing money on buses for quite a number of years, and only in the recent quarter have we seen a turnaround, helped partly by measures that they have taken as well as the fortuitous situation of a reduction in fuel costs.
At the end of the day, what is important, the overriding factor that is of importance must be: are our fares affordable, how do our fares compare to that of other countries and cities? Because if you say that you stifle every possibility of a private operator making some profit, improving efficiency, productivity of which there is a dividend that is paid to all commuters through that 0.5% in the fare formula, if you stifle all that, then, ultimately, if it results in an even larger increase in fares, is that of benefit to everybody? That, to me, must be the question that we always ask.
That is the question that the PTC looks at very carefully – how do you find a balance between making sure that fares are affordable to commuters, and yet ensuring the financial viability of the entire system. If the system ultimately is not financially sustainable, then over time, the Government and all taxpayers will have to step in to bail it out. The important thing is to make sure it remains financially viable; make sure that our fares are affordable on two counts. One is in comparison with other cities; and two, in comparison with household income and the percentage that households are paying on public transportation.
:
Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his explanation. I think the overriding factor must be whether there is a justification for an increase in the fare since the reported profit keeps going up. Anybody who invests in the company will know that those operators do not bear high risk because they are providing a basic need; everybody will have to take public transport if they do not own a car. My question is to come back to this fare review formula. Can the profitability of the PTOs be included in the fare review formula? Can the change in the formula be effected earlier?
: On the formula, I think it is always useful to allow a formula to run for a number of years. We have had this formula running since 2013. I think it is useful for it to continue until 2017 and we do a review then. On the point that profitability has increased and therefore, we should not increase fares – I take the Member's point. Thus, the converse must also be true – that when profitability has decreased, even though they are profitable, we must allow them to increase fares.
So, the Member's point was when profitability increases, take that into account, and therefore do not allow them to increase fares. Now, I see the Member's point, that as long as they are profitable, we cannot allow them to increase fares. And hence, we come back to the question of what incentive is there for them to be even more efficient and more productive, which ultimately benefits the commuters? If they run a shoddy operation, and the business becomes very expensive, ultimately, we all bear the costs. That always is a fundamental.
Second point is this: we have mentioned that they have major financial commitments over the next few years, until 2019. I hope that point is not lost. They have commitments to buy trains and all the other projects that we had spoken about in the previous parliamentary sessions, amounting to about $2 billion.
Therefore, if you take $2 billion, what does it all mean? It is more than three times the cumulative profits over the most recent five years. More than three times of that. They will have to figure out a way to meet these commitments. They will have to figure out a way to make sure that they remain profitable. But most important of all, they will have to figure out a way to make sure that they continue to improve on reliability and the service that they offer to commuters.
: I would like to ask the Minister: in relation to the provision of public transport, is there not also a duty on the part of the providers to see that as part of their public service? In other words, we should not look at profitability and determine the price of public transport fares, just solely on the basis that the buses may or may not be making profits. The fact is that there is cross-subsidisation within the company, and overall, there is profit. So, should the company or rather the PTC then not take that into account in determining the fare as well? Thank you.
: Thank you, Mdm Speaker, and I thank Ms Chia for that supplementary question. Indeed, as I have mentioned earlier, there is a certain amount of cross-subsidy. They do not determine the fares; neither do they determine the standards because, really, at the end of the day, they are almost running like monopolies. The last thing you want for them to do is to be able to determine standards and to determine fares. So, the standards are actually determined by the Land Transport Authority. The fares are determined by the Public Transport Council.
We have debated extensively in this House about the fare formula that was derived in 2013 after Mr Richard Magnus and his team took an extended amount of time to study this matter carefully, as well as to consult widely before coming out with the fare formula.
My fundamental point is this, which is really an elaboration of what I have mentioned to Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: are we better off if the services are provided by an entity that is run effectively, that is able to keep costs down, that is able to allow us to enjoy relatively low fares, certainly compared to cities around the world, is that of benefit to us?
And if that is of benefit to us, rather than the converse which we have seen in a number of cities where they run nationalised systems, not very efficiently done, the cost goes up, they have no handle on that as well as on other aspects of transportation. Ultimately, it is borne by much higher fares in those cities or through a large subsidy from government and taxpayers, if you look at those two possibilities, then I think certainly the former must be more enjoyable and acceptable for Singaporeans. That is, I think, the situation that we have today.
I understand the point and I understand the concern that people always have over profitability of these operators - what is the reasonable amount, what is acceptable, and so on. In the past, we also look at Return On Total Assets (ROTA), but for the recent fare formula, I think they have also tried to make sure that we just do not look only at the ROTA but try and have a formula that mirrors more closely the operating cost of the two operators. And, at the same time, make sure that the productivity improvements that they do make, part of it is given back to commuters as well.
So, hopefully, we are trying to arrive at a balance where fares are affordable, in relation to household income and expenditure; fares are affordable in relation to what other cities around the world may be paying for the same level of service or a lower level of service, in fact. And fares are affordable because there are various targeted subsidy schemes that the Government may put in place in order to protect the most vulnerable groups. I think that is the situation that we are trying to achieve.
:
Mdm Speaker, a supplementary question. From the Minister's reply, it seems to me that the fare needs to be increased, so that the operator remains profitable and with that, they can thereby be more efficient. That is the logic that I understand. But on the converse, will it be that if the company or the operator is profitable and productive enough, they would have made enough profit and there is no need to increase fare?
: Mdm Speaker, I am not really sure I follow the argument of Mr Low Thia Khiang so much. But let me try to interpret what I understand from it - that if they are profitable enough and productive enough, there is no need, or if they are efficient enough, productive enough and profitable enough, forget about the profitability. If they are efficient enough and productive enough, there is no need to increase fares.
Theoretically, yes, except that they do face cost pressures as well. They employ more people, many of them Singaporeans. Their employees do expect wages to go up. You run Town Councils, some of you run companies and so on, and you know the cost pressures that we all come under, and they come under to.
Much as they would like to reach that state of nirvana where efficiency, effectiveness, productivity can overcome all these pressures, the truth is that 80% of their cost largely mirrors the Core CPI as well as the wage increases. We know wages have been going up; we know that Core CPI has been going up; we have been fortunate that the 20% component, that is, the energy index has gone down, using the index for 2013. In the second half, prices have come down compared to 2012.
So, I am not so sure that you can actually escape from the fundamental point that they do, like every other entity, public or private, come under the same cost pressures, the same expectations of their employees to see a reasonable increase in the wages. Driving buses, for example, is a very manpower-intensive kind of operation together with the maintenance of the buses. I think, inevitably, they cannot avoid coming under the same pressures which is reflected in the formula that Mr Magnus and his team have derived.
asked
the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the projected reduction of electricity and gas tariffs in the next six to 12 months in view of the lower price of fuel oil.
(for the Minister for Trade and Industry)
:Mdm Speaker, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) do not project electricity and town gas tariffs. Both the electricity and town gas tariffs are reviewed by EMA on a quarterly basis to ensure that the tariffs fairly reflect the underlying costs of production, and that includes fuel costs.
The fuel cost component of the electricity tariff is based on the average forward fuel oil and dated Brent prices in the first two and a half months in the preceding quarter, and makes up approximately half of the electricity tariff. For town gas, the fuel cost component is based on the average forward fuel oil and naphtha prices for the quarter, and makes up about 40% of the tariff.
The price of natural gas, which is the main fuel used to produce electricity and town gas in Singapore, has fallen in tandem with global oil prices. This is because our natural gas contracts are indexed to oil prices, which is the market practice in Asia.
In the recent tariff revisions, the electricity tariff for January to March 2015 decreased by 7.9% to 23.29 cents/kWh, and that is compared to a decrease in fuel cost of 16.4%. As I have mentioned, fuel cost is about approximately half the cost of generating electricity. The town gas tariff for February to April 2015 decreased by 8.7% to 19.02 cents/kWh, compared to a decrease in fuel cost of 23.1%.
asked
the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the economic promotion agencies have set targets for the number of SMEs to be groomed into Globally Competitive Companies within a specific period of time; and (b) if so, what are these targets and time periods.
(for the Minister for Trade and Industry)
:
In its 2010 report, the Economic Strategies Committee set an aspirational goal of having 1,000 Singapore enterprises with revenues above $100 million by 2020. This is an increase of 470 from the base of 530 such enterprises in 2007. The goal of reaching 1,000 such companies reflects the objective of developing a strong base of globally competitive companies to create a vibrant corporate ecosystem in Singapore, and grow the external wing of our economy.
:
I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I just wanted to ask the Minister of State what are the current schemes that the Government is putting in place in order to achieve this target of 1,000 companies, and are there any benchmarks on these schemes to achieve those targets?
: For companies to grow to $100 million revenue in size, they have to do a few things - expanding their base revenue and creating new revenue streams. At the same time, they have to look at the type of sectors they are in and which kind of markets they should target, overseas especially because Singapore, being a smaller market, may not be sufficient for them to grow to that certain size.
There are a few schemes through which we help them. First is that they have to strengthen their company, especially the internal processes, and new technologies, so that it is scalable for the companies to grow to a large size of $100 million. We have a Capability Development Fund that helps them to tap on that to apply technology, human capital development and also productivity improvements. Today, there are more than 1,000 companies or enterprises that tap on these funds. We hope that more companies can come forward to do it; more companies can tap on these funds. This is for the internal processes.
The other schemes to help them is the one to expand their revenue base of going international, internalisation, going overseas and all. IE Singapore has several trade missions that we bring companies overseas and assess the market. But at the same time, for companies that cannot go for these overseas trips or are unable to, say, set up base overseas, we have a scheme that helps them to assess the market through information and resources that we have gathered there, and then provide them with the data when they are locally based here.
For example, schemes like the Market Readiness Assistance, it provides a broad-based informational, advisory and financial support for SMES in order to assess whether they should go international. Secondly, of course, we have the Global Company Partnership Scheme. We identify some potential good companies and, I would not say hand-hold them, but we go in-depth into their operations and we work with them together to assess opportunities oversea and create revenue streams.
To date, we have assisted more than 27,000 companies, of which 80% are SMEs, to internationalise, and this is an increase of 16,000 companies in 2013. We can see that more and more companies are going overseas. Hopefully, we can reach our target of 1,000 companies by 2020.
asked
the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the additional measures that the police is embarking on, including co-operation with other Government agencies, to prevent further escalation of crimes involving e-commerce; and (b) how many cheating cases involving e-commerce have been solved in 2012, 2013 and 2014.
(for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)
:Mdm Speaker, there were 238 reported cases of cheating involving e-commerce in 2012, 510 cases in 2013, and 1,659 cases in 2014. The sharp increase reflects the growth of online shopping transactions, and greater awareness and reporting of such crimes.
From 2012 to 2014, 132 arrests were made in connection with such cases. However, many perpetrators are based overseas, making it harder for the Police to track them down. Investigations also take more time given the transboundary nature of such crimes and Police need to work closely with their international counterparts.
As more people are making purchases online, criminals will attempt to capitalise on this trend. Police will continue to educate consumers to beware of such scams when they do online shopping. For example, in November 2014, the National Crime Prevention Council and the Police launched a nationwide Anti-Scam Public Education Campaign to raise public awareness of common scams in Singapore. This includes a new website, advertisements and other materials that explain how scams are carried out.
The Police are also working closely with partners such as the Media Development Authority, Monetary Authority of Singapore, major financial institutions and online shopping sites to broaden efforts to educate consumers about online scams.
:
I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. The crime rate involving e-commerce has increased by more than 200% in 2014 – 225% to be exact – and it is a cause for concern. And the problem, as he says, is compounded by the low solving rate of e-commerce crime. I had, last year, in September, suggested that the Police consider setting up a dedicated cyber crime unit so that they can really look at the different aspects of cyber crime, get the relevant skill-sets and also look at the transboundary kind of situation. But it did not appear to Senior Minister of State Magasos at that time to take this suggestion seriously. So, if the e-commerce crime rate has increased so rapidly, would MHA consider this suggestion again?
:
Madam, we share the Member's concern over the rising rate of such cyber crimes. The Police have been taking a series of measures. As I mentioned, one aspect of them pertains to the collaboration with other Government agencies as well as the transaction providers or the service providers, and also conducting broader education campaigns in order to raise the awareness. Police are also constantly upgrading their cyber capabilities and they work closely with international partners and experts in order to track down persons who use the Internet to commit crimes. The nature of this crime is such that it is somewhat elusive at times, given the nature of the medium and the transboundary nature of the transactions. But having said that, there is increasing collaboration and the Police have got specific resources allocated for this purpose. And I would add that the Police are also working with Interpol's new Global Complex for Innovation, which is located in Singapore. One aspect of this Complex is a digital crime centre that supports digital forensic and develops new solutions to tackle cyber crime. So, I want to assure the Member and, indeed, all Members of the House that this is something that is taken seriously. The Police have allocated specific resources, maybe not a division, as suggested by the Member, but there have been allocated resources and specialties developed, and there is collaboration with international bodies as well as the Interpol centre in Singapore.
asked
the Minister for Transport whether the public transport operators (PTOs) will consider extending a special transport voucher to all Singaporeans especially the Pioneer Generation in commemoration of SG50 and/or extending a special fare rebate to all commuters due to the current low oil prices.
: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the suggestion. It is also one that Mr Seng Han Thong had separately raised to me earlier. As part of the 2014 Fare Review Exercise, the two public transport operators will contribute $13.5 million to the Public Transport Fund. We intend to use up to $7.5 million from this Fund to provide 250,000 Public Transport Vouchers of $30 value to needy families for this fare exercise.
The Government also has plans for the remaining amount in the Public Transport Fund and we will announce the details when we are ready to do so.
:
I thank the Minister for the positive reply. I think we are all aware that Singapore public transport is heavily subsidised by the Government. My thinking is that since it is heavily subsidised, and actually there are profits made by the transport companies, and there are also savings there, would the Ministry perhaps consider making all Singaporeans as shareholders of these public transport companies, so that they get to share in the savings, especially for this year, which is SG50? I think we had done that in the past via the issuing of Singtel Special Shares. Perhaps, the Government may consider that to celebrate SG50 and to thank all Singaporeans for their support this year, for the understanding that they show, and for the support of the transport operators, especially in the past two years, for the inconvenience that some of them have to go through.
:
Mr Gan, can you please put your question?
:
Okay. Thank you.
:
Mdm Speaker, let me thank the Member for his suggestion which is to make all Singaporeans shareholders in the company. I am afraid that this is something that comes outside of the ambit of the Ministry of Transport, but I will raise this matter to the Minister for Finance and to let him consider this in his own good time.
asked
the Minister for National Development between 2010 and 2014, what is the number and percentage of HDB BTO flat applicants who (i) give up their units before collecting their keys though they have selected their flats (ii) appeal to delay the collection of their keys, broken down by year, room type and whether they are first-time applicants.
(for the Minister for National Development)
:Mdm Speaker, for the sales launches from 2010 to 2014, there were about 113,000 new flat bookings as at 31 January this year. Of these bookings, about 10,000 or 9% of the applicants did not complete the purchase.
The number of appeals to delay key collection totalled about 460 – 30 in 2010, followed by 50 in 2011; 90, 90 in 2012 and 2013; and 200 in 2014. The increase in appeals corresponded with the increase in the number of flats completed over the years.
Out of the 460 appeals, about 180 appeals were from first-timer applicants. Generally, 4- and 5-room flat types had more appeals from first-timers, while the smaller flat types had more appeals from second-timer applicants. About three in four of them have since collected the keys.
:
I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I was asking about the percentage and the number of applicants who gave up their flats from 2010 to 2014, break up by the year, to see whether there is an increasing trend of residents not able to collect their keys due to financial problems. They have booked the flat but they could not collect the keys because of financial problems.
:
Madam, for the figures as of now, if the Member could file a written request, we could put up a table for him. But my sense is that HDB will look at the individual circumstances of the applicants. If they face, for example, financial hardship that the Member spoke of, we will see how best we can assist.
asked
the Minister for National Development in 2013 and 2014 (a) what is the number of Singaporeans and permanent residents who have appealed to HDB to purchase a HDB flat whilst holding (i) private property in Singapore (ii) overseas property; and (b) how many of them have been successful in their appeals
(for the Minister for National Development)
:
Madam, in 2013 and 2014, a total of 1,587 Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents appealed to buy an HDB flat while holding on to their private property. Among them, 486 owned a local private property, while 1,101 owned an overseas private property. Six hundred and six of the appeals were approved. All approved cases were appeals from Singapore Citizens.
:
I thank the Minister of State for the reply. For those appealed cases involving Singapore Citizens owning overseas properties, and yet they could buy an HDB flat, what are the criteria that HDB uses to evaluate these appeals?
:
Mdm Speaker, HDB will assess each case on a case-by-case basis. For example, if a resident was under extenuating circumstances such as financial hardship and needed to buy an HDB flat while the private property was undergoing mortgage sale, this could be some of the circumstances that we will look into, but each case is different. We assess them individually.
asked
the Minister for Transport (a) what are the guidelines for erecting covered pedestrian overhead bridges; and (b) whether the Ministry will review these guidelines for existing pedestrian overhead bridges that span across major expressways connecting residential estates to make it more convenient for residents.
(for the Minister for Transport)
:
Mdm Speaker, 84% of pedestrian overhead bridges are covered. Over time, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) plans to provide cover for the rest, including those that span across expressways. Those that have higher pedestrian usage and are connected to a transport node or facility will be accorded higher priority.
:Madam, a couple of supplementary questions. Working towards an enhanced pedestrian walking experience, would the Ministry consider incorporating standard shelters across all its overhead bridges connecting housing precincts other than meeting the criteria of connecting transport nodes, schools or even public institutions? Because I have two such bridges across the PIE in Bukit Batok which many residents have made appeals for. So, I hope that the Ministry can consider that.
The second question: since we are on the issue of overhead bridges, can the Ministry also update us on the status of LTA's efforts in making our overhead bridges more accessible to our elderly, wheel-chair bound commuters, cyclists, and parents with prams?
: Madam, I would like to thank the Member for the questions. Essentially, as I had mentioned earlier, we would cover all the overhead bridges and we would give priority to those which have higher pedestrian flow as well as those connected to the Walk2Ride programme or within 400 m of a rail station. With regard to the standard, I would like to clarify what is meant by the "standard".
Secondly, it is about the facilities for the elderly. In fact, we have started a long while ago to provide such facilities and we are continuing our efforts to do so, as part of these plans for an ageing society. It is not only done by LTA or MOT; it is an inter-ministerial effort. And I would like to assure the Member that it is something that is a high priority in our agenda as part of our process of providing for an inclusive society. Maybe the Member could share with me about the "standard" that he mentioned.
:
Mr Ong.
:
Madam, allow me to clarify. The "standard" which I referred to is to provide shorter pedestrian overhead bridges (POBs). That is, for any POBs that connect an housing estate to another housing estate. I have two POBs in Bukit Batok that are not covered yet. I also know that one of the criteria is to have high pedestrian traffic. But for some bridges, they do not have high traffic but they do give tremendous convenience to our residents who want to connect from one estate to another estate.
:
Again, I would like to reiterate that we will cover all over time. With regard to his covered linkways, maybe if he could share the specific details with me, I am sure our staff at LTA would work closely with him with regard to the POBs in question. So, I look forward to receiving details from him.
asked
the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will continue with the free pre-peak travel scheme for the MRT and make it a permanent scheme.
(for the Minister for Transport)
:
Mdm Speaker, the free pre-peak travel trial was extended until 23 June 2015. The ratio of morning peak commuters to pre-peak commuters heading to the city has been sustained at around 2.1, compared to 2.7 prior to the trial. This translates to a 7%-8% shift since the trial started. A survey by LTA showed that the lack of flexible work arrangements may be a reason why the shift has not been more pronounced. To address this, we have been working with employers in the city through the Travel Smart programme since July last year. Forty-three companies have joined the programme so far. We will continue to evaluate the free pre-peak trial, along with the Travel Smart programme, before deciding if the scheme should be extended or made permanent.
: Order. End of Question Time.
:
Minister Shanmugam.
:  Mdm Speaker, I said that I would come back to clarify if necessary on Annex 3. Ms Lim asked me yesterday whether the table, which I circulated showing AHPETC paying FMSS significantly more per unit, is correct. I have verified the rates in the table that I gave, in Annex 3, are correct. These are the rates in the management agency contracts that the Town Councils have signed with their respective Managing Agents.
AHPETC is the only Town Council where the MA charges differential rates for residential and commercial units. Some Town Councils, in the past, charged differential rates, but all the MAs have since done away and applied a fixed rate for both. Ms Lim may have been mistaken and confused the MA rates with the S&CC charges paid by commercial units which may differ from the S&CC charges paid by residential units.
So, the calculation that I have put out is correct and, on a weighted average basis, AHPETC pays $1.6 million more compared with other Town Councils. Thank you.
:
Ms Sylvia Lim, you wish to make a clarification?
:
Yes, Madam, and also to clarify to what the Minister has just clarified if I could.
:
Yes, not a speech, please, Ms Lim.
:
No.
:
Just a clarification.
:
Yes, Mdm Speaker. I would like to respond to what the Minister mentioned. I was not confused about whether it was S&CC rates or MA rates. My response was based on documents that we had seen from PAP Town Council Managing Agents stating very specifically that they charged a higher rate for commercial units compared to residential units. So, that is my clarification. So, Madam, may I proceed to clarify something I said in my speech yesterday?
:
Yes, please.
:
Yesterday, in response to the Minister's mention of cyclical information reports being late from AHPETC, I said that in terms of replacing lift parts, the ropes and sheaves were on time and that lift batteries were being scheduled in accordance with the schedule by MND. What I should have said was that the replacement of the ropes and sheaves was on schedule, and replacement of lift batteries is being done in accordance with the schedule that we have given to MND.
:
Mr Liang Eng Hwa.
:  Mdm Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to join in the debate.
What was revealed in the AGO report went beyond what many had imagined. It is like reading an extreme negative case study in a text book on corporate governance. The only difference is that this real. It is a live example and, sadly, something that will bring disrepute to many of our elected Members here.
Glaring lapses that are most disturbing to me and many others are the mismanagement of the sinking funds, the disregard for the governance of related party transactions and conflict of interest, shocking lack of internal control, mishandling of the S&CCs arrears and several instances of amounts collected and paid out that were not properly recorded, to name a few.
It gave the impression of a house in disarray and also, critically, the absence of leadership to ensure governance, transparency and accountability.
The financial affairs for the Town Council were in such a shambles that both AGO and, earlier, the AHPETC independent auditors were unable to draw any meaningful opinion on the Town Council's state of affairs and transactions. AGO said that due to the inadequacies in the accounting system and procedures, the financial statements prepared were inaccurate and not reliable. And, hence, they were unable to establish if public funds were properly spent, accounted for and managed.
AHPETC's independent auditor had not once but twice and, in fact, two years in a row, stated that they were not able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide basis for an audit opinion. In the 2012/13 report, its independent auditor issued a qualified opinion stating 13 issues of concern over the Town Council's account.
I know this was talked about at length yesterday by Minister Khaw and Minister Shanmugam, but it is worth reiterating again to remind all in this Chamber of the seriousness.
Qualified opinions from independent auditors are about the most disapproving opinion you can get from an auditor. And it usually suggests material discrepancies that compromise the accuracies and integrity of the financial statements. Any companies receiving a qualified opinion would almost drop everything to immediately address the issues raised and would expeditiously act to rectify the concerns raised as well. However, in the case of AHPETC, its response to the adverse audit report was surprisingly one of sloppiness and lack of urgency with a number of audit issues not rectified thereafter.
The public is not accessible to the Town Council's state of finances and processes. Hence, they will have to depend on independently audited statements to know if things are in order. In the last three years, the public and Parliament were denied the right as there were no credible and unqualified financial reports that can be based on and to scrutinise.
So, yesterday, Ms Sylvia Lim told the House that many committees had been formed by the Town Council, and how she chaired her chairman's committee meetings, the various measures she has put in place, the Members of Parliament's estate visits. They were all mentioned in the annex that she presented. Well, form without substance is meaningless. What really matters to the public are results and desired outcomes, in the sense that funds are well spent and accounted for. Clearly, in the case of AHPETC, the outcomes are a let-down.
The Town Council was set up to manage the HDB estates and entrusted with the responsibility to manage very large sums of public money, money from residents in the form of S&CC, and from the Government in the form of grants from MND.
Town Councils are not part of the Singapore Public Service. Therefore, MOF's Instruction Manual (IM) does not apply here. Instead, the Town Council Act was crafted to give the Town Council financial autonomy and devolved powers to manage their own businesses, including procurement and financial management. The elected Members of Parliament of the Town Councils are empowered to appoint key appointment holders and council members.
Clearly, there are significant powers and autonomy given to the Town Council. But it does come with accountability and responsibility as well.
Given the political nature of Town Councils, the issue of governance and accountability should rightly be dealt with in Parliament, the highest political institution of the land. It is the duty of every one of us here in this House to resolutely uphold the high standards of governance in Town Councils, certainly no worse standards than any companies or charitable organisations. We must not let any errant practices erode public confidence and trust in the integrity of the finances of Town Councils. We, the elected representatives, are the guardians of governance, transparency and accountability. And it cannot be just form without substance, talk without actions.
The debate in this House is also necessary because, in the area of financial management, payments and procurement procedures and processes, it is not often obvious to the general public as to whether public monies are properly managed and clearly accounted for.
Mdm Speaker, I want to record my concerns with regard to the lapses in the sinking fund raised by AGO.
In AGO's report, it flagged that AHPETC had failed to make the required transfers of the conservancy and service fees and the Government grants into the sinking fund accounts for the last three quarters of FY2011/2012, in non-compliance with the Town Council Financial Rules. It later transferred a $2.7 million and an additional amount of $1.2 million only after being queried by AGO.
Monies in the sinking fund are set aside for future cyclical maintenance, such as repainting of common areas, replacing water tanks and pipes, re-roofing and electrical rewiring, upgrading of lifts, which is a costly item, replacing rubbish chutes and water pumps and so on. These are the real things that need to happen with money from sinking fund.
The consequences of having insufficient money in the sinking fund are that many of these essential maintenance works may not be done and, hence, resulting in poorer living conditions, the living environment, frequent breakdowns and repair disruptions, and even compromising the safety of residents. These consequences may not be seen in the initial few years but, as the estates ages, residents will soon be at the short end of the stick and suffering. And the Town Council may have to levy more S&CC to pay for the maintenance costs. And, of course, there is also this risk of inflation that you have to take into consideration.
It is for this reason that sinking funds are segregated and ring-fenced so that Town Councils cannot dip into these funds for other operating and routine uses. If there are no regular and diligent contributions to the sinking fund, it will soon run out of money and there will be no cyclical maintenance to talk about.
Like the reserves that the country builds up over the years for our long-term security, the accumulation and disciplined contribution to the sinking fund are at the core of the type of government that we want in Singapore, which is, to do whatever is right and in the long-term good of Singapore and our people. In contrast, mismanagement and wrong use of sinking funds, tells a different set of value system – that of short-sighted and populist government.
I am very concerned that AHPETC took such a lax attitude towards the sinking fund. If AGO had not pointed out this lapse, it is only common sense to expect that the Town Council sinking fund would soon be running short of funds to maintain the estates Then, we will see the estate deteriorating and the quality of life worsening for the residents.
Also of particular concern is another related lapse pointed out by AGO with regard to the GST input tax claimed from IRAS. In this case, sinking fund expenditures were paid from the sinking fund's bank accounts for two financial years. However, the two amounts claimed – $643,000 and $888,000 – were not returned back to the sinking fund and ended up in the operating account. This, again, will deplete the sinking funds which are for longer term use. Instead, the funds were transferred to the operating account which is for short-term use.
In another instance, maturing deposits of $5.49 million intended for the sinking fund was not credited into the sinking fund bank account. Again, it went into the operating fund account. According to the AGO's report, even after restoring the full amount, the sinking fund is still short of the missing $490,000.
These and other lapses related to the sinking fund pointed out by the AGO will seriously undermine the adequacy and sufficiency of the sinking fund, and this is not unacceptable.
The WP is not new in running a Town Council, having run Hougang Town Council for more than 20 years. Hence, it surprised me why AHPETC did not transfer the money, as required, to the sinking fund bank accounts. It is not about whether you have a good IT software system or not. It is simply about whether the management is conscious of the importance of the sinking fund and the presence of mind to see that this is adhered to.
The previous PAP-run Town Council for Aljunied left a healthy reserve of about $90 million to the current WP-run Town Council. It is only right that the current leadership of the Town Council ensured that the long-term funding needs of the Town Council are safeguarded and the hard-earned monies of the residents are properly and fairly spent.
The AGO's report also pointed out the serious conflict of interests issues and the disregard for related party transactions; which were well covered by Minister Shanmugam and Minister Khaw yesterday.
Again, I want to record my serious concern on this situation where the "Group of Four" or the "Gang of Four" sit as key appointment holders of AHPETC and yet are also the owners and directors of the company that render for-profit services to the Town Council. And most amazingly, notwithstanding the related party transactions and the fit and proper issues, they were given the job of certifying work done and approving cheque payments from the Town Council to their own company.
So, again, the common sense question is: how can that be allowed to be passed by the Councillors of the Town Council? Are the stewards of the Town Council not supposed to discharge their fiduciary duties and responsibilities?
Again, were these lapses due to ignorance, or were they incompetent? Or is it a case of the Town Council taking advantage of the financial autonomy granted to the Town Councils?
It also amazing to see how AHPETC has flip-flopped and reported wide swings in the S&CC arrear numbers. The arrears report to MND and to AHPETC's Finance & Investment Committee were unreliable and are not aligned. More than three years into running the Town Council, AHPETC still does not have a system that can generate reliable arrears data. This is unsustainable and unfair to residents who duly pay their S&CC.
Mdm Speaker, we are all really shocked and at the same time saddened to read observations in the AGO report and the AHPETC's Independent Auditor's report. The systemic breakdown of internal controls as well as the messiness and the sloppiness in the way town council operated is the consequences of incompetent management, to say the least.
As at now, we are not even sure if the financial statements tabled are correct and reflect the true state of affairs at AHPETC. In other words, we do not know what we do not know. Listening to speeches of the Workers' Party Members of Parliament yesterday, I am not sure if they have come to grip with these serious lapses.
Last night, at a coffee shop dinner, an auditor friend of mine told me an interesting comment. He said, "Why is the People's Action Party (PAP) doing Workers' Party (WP) a favour by helping them to get their house in order, and yet being accused of bullying the WP?" He said that the way things are going, the Town Council is clearly down on a slippery slope and in no time it will turn into a monster and collapse on its own weight.
So, I had to explain to him that as a responsible political party, we cannot allow such poor management of public funds and public money to occur and impacting the lives of our citizens, even if it means hurting us politically, and also the perception that PAP bullies WP. In any case, we are more concerned whether WP is bullying their own residents with these malpractices. From the numbers that Minister K Shanmugam just clarified, obviously the MA is charging the Town Council a lot more than the other Town Councils, and from the other numbers that have been reviewed, it is quite clearly that FMSS has clearly short changed the town council. In other words, the Town Council paid more, and the residents get less.
Mdm Speaker, what we have learned from the AGO report is far from the best practices that we expected from a political-linked organisation like Town Councils, funded by public money and run by elected Members. These are worst practices that may not even find its place in a third world parliament.
Finally, I want to quote a comment made by Mr Zulkifli Baharudin, in Wednesday's
Straits Times
. He said, "It shouldn't be that if you're from a smaller party, your standards are lower. If someone votes for opposition, it is because he thinks they can do a better job. You cannot join politics and say that you are inexperienced."
Our politics must not be about accepting mediocre performance and sub-standard practices. Singaporeans deserve better. AHPETC have to rectify these serious shortcomings and accurately restate and present their financials expeditiously.
Madam, I support the motion in the name of National Development Minister. Given the seriousness of the issue, at the time of voting, and with your consent, I would like to call for a Division.
:  Mdm Speaker, we all know what the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) is known for and the values they represent. In every report that came out of AGO since time immemorial, entities under its scrutiny had to go through a baptism of fire whenever the AGO came knocking. I have full respect for their work.
Over the years, the AGO has found sad instances of over payments, payments without evidence that goods and services were delivered, duplicate payments and in one instance amounting to $18.6 million, and so on, in many Ministries and Organs of States it audited.
One agency was found to have called for a quotation instead of a tender for a project that exceeded $70,000 in the 2010/11 AGO report. Another agency was cited to have issued purchase orders to the term contractor only after the contractor has started the work.
AGO also revealed that 10 statutory boards did not present their FY2006/2007 annual reports to Parliament within the six-month time frame, and three of these boards had also been late the previous two year. One of them did not even present its audited financial statements to Parliament for the previous two financial years.
Awarding contract to sole tenderer despite the offer did not meet technical requirements specified in the tender and paying more than the contract price for extension of contract were all flagged. Even the agencies under the Ministry of National Development were cited for over-payment, late payment, mistaken use of waiver of competition.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was cited for not having complied with Government procurement principles of transparency, open and fair competition, and value for money when an overseas mission was audited.
The Public Service Division was also flagged for informing a bidder that it had secured a contract worth $455,000, 13 days before the Tender Board made the award decision.
Some of these lapses were small in financial values while others were serious and the list goes on. Like what the Ministers said yesterday, in some country, the CEO would have taken a deep bow, apologise, and resign but I guess this is not in our culture.
Madam, the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC) is also found by AGO to have erred in some of these areas and I am certain AHPETC will not be the last as well because good corporate governance is a work in progress.
The Workers' Party takes the AGO findings very seriously. We have acknowledged our shortcomings in certain areas as well as defended our actions in others. On any other given day, this report may read like a typical AGO report on any entity under audit but today the spotlight is on AHPETC and we will explain the issues to the public.
First, I would like to specifically address one of the major lapses mentioned by AGO under para 3.2(c) of the main report which states that AHPETC does not have "a system to monitor arrears of conservancy and services charges accurately and hence there is no assurance that arrears are properly managed."
We have explained to AGO that AHPETC does have a system to track every financial transaction in a resident's account including HDB grants, monthly S&CC, payments, penalties, legal costs, and interests, if any, dating back to 1996 if the residents are from Hougang.
We have also explained how these S&CC payments are collected and uploaded into our financial and accounting system. Every transaction via cash, credit card, cheque, NETS, Internet banking and inter-bank GIRO, is identified and posted into the respective resident's record in the Accounts Receivable and General Ledger at the end of the day or whenever the collection agencies inform us. This has allowed AHPETC to monitor the arrears situation of an individual account "live", up to date, and on demand.
AHPETC is able to account to residents as to whether they have paid their S&CC or whether they are in arrears if they were to enquire at the any of our branches across our town.
Madam, what AHPETC does not have is a programme to generate aggregated S&CC data in the format requested by MND and to monitor them in that specific format. The computer system currently in use at AHPETC was an upscaled version of the system from Hougang SMC and it was put into operation within a short span of one month. A lot of the features required to handle the operation of a GRC were not implemented then.
As we have mentioned in our media release, all reports submitted to MND up to April 2013 were prepared by staff based on data generated by the IT system and extracted through manual sorting and counting. AHPETC also acknowledges that this manual process is not ideal and efficient as the data set is huge. It is also tedious and subject to reporting and human errors.
AHPETC has made incremental improvements to the computer system over the years. Our system may be rudimentary in features compared to what was available before 2011, but it is certainly robust in keeping a reliable database. We took time to have the data and process reviewed internally and externally before we released our S&CC arrears rate of 5.66% as at 30 September 2014 a few weeks ago. In short, we were not evasive when we said we would address the issue in due course. We will work towards providing timely data to MND in the coming weeks albeit not in the format the Ministry requires but nonetheless relevant enough to take a snapshot of the arrears situation at AHPETC.
Next, I want to highlight the challenging environment AHPETC is working in, some of which relate to the 13 points of disclaimers highlighted by the auditors of AHPETC for FY2012/2013.
In Part 1 of the AGO report under one of the disclaimers on Receivables from Sundry Debtors, AGO revealed that AHPETC did not monitor and take timely follow-up action on its receivables.
In para 2.34 of the report, it was stated that most of the outstanding receivables as at 1 July 2014 were amounts due from HDB and NEA. While there were invoices under dispute, there were also instances where HDB was reviewing claims dating back to May and November 2012.
In subsection (ii) of the same para, NEA rejected four invoices from AHPETC because they were wrongly sent to one of the regional offices. NEA further explained that by the time the invoices were received by the relevant division, the period provided for payments or credit period had lapsed and NEA was unable to process the invoices for payment. The agency then requested AHPETC to re-issue the four invoices.
Madam, invoices do not carry expiry dates. The 30-day credit term listed on an invoice is to let the debtors know that they have to pay within the stipulated period or the creditors will reserve the right to impose penalties. It is common to replace a missing invoice under the same invoice number and date, or to re-issue an invoice due to amendments but to request for new invoices due to expired credit terms is highly unconventional.
To void an invoice needs justification. Is it right to do that just so an agency can be seen to be prompt in making payments on paper?
Under the same report for Disclaimer 6(a) on page 23, AGO also revealed that AHPETC does have a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for non-routine works contrary to what the previous auditor had claimed. AGO was of the opinion that AHPETC should stipulate a timeline for verification works to be done by property officers after job sheets were received in the SOP, not that AHPETC does not have a SOP.
Next, I would like to highlight what my colleague, Ms Sylvia Lim, has said yesterday on the oversight of payments.
The headline in the
Lianhe Wanbao
, "Town Council Secretary and GM pay their own company $6.6 million", is very mischievous. Out of the $6.6 million, $6.4 million or 96% is related to agreed monthly sums for services provided by the Managing Agent and Essential Maintenance Service Unit under contracts approved by the Town Council.
These are necessary recurring payments for critical services to keep our town running, or else rubbish will pile up three-storey high and lives will be endangered if residents are trapped in the lifts with no rescue effort carried out in the shortest possible time.
Our MA cannot make payments to themselves for the above services without the Chairman or one of the Vice Chairmen to co-sign the cheque bearing in mind that at the same time, there are oversight committees to ensure work is done.
We monitor calls, complaints, conservancy issues, electrical issues, lift issues, customer services issues, and so on across our town and by divisions. Checks are done monthly at our Estate & Community Liaison Committee (ECLC) meetings and quarterly Town Council meetings. So, these are not payments for nothing or for unknown services or work done.
Last, I wish to touch on safeguarding public funds. It is a waste of public funds for an incoming administration to develop a new computer system that does essentially the same functions as the previous system, which was also develop with public funds.
I understand in the old days, HDB used to provide Town Councils with a centralised computer system. It makes perfect sense since Town Councils are set up to manage only HDB estates and the common areas. Who else would have the latest data on the number of flats in an estate, the types of flats, the residency status of the tenants, the amount of grant each flat should receive, when to start collecting S&CC and whether the unit is rented out whole or partial? All these information affects S&CC and grants.
And such systems are not cheap to develop. The old system at Aljunied Town Council cost over $20 million hardware and software split amongst other PAP Town Councils. AHPETC has spent over half a million dollars just to replicate the old system and what the old system could do, and we still have a way to go. Is that not a waste of resources and public funds? Setting up a centralised computer system will certainly safeguard residents' interest and money no doubt.
Madam, there are many observations made in the AGO report but at the end of it all, the buck stops at AHPETC. I cannot remember if any Minister had ordered any audit or any audit on any Ministry or Organ of State in recent times due to disclaimers or adverse opinions expressed by its auditors but nonetheless, AHPETC has cooperated in this audit and will take lessons from the findings in the spirit of public accountability and good corporate governance.

Mrs Josephine Teo.
:
Thank you, Mdm Speaker, I would like to seek a clarification from the Member, Mr Png.
Mr Png had compared the AGO's report of its audit on AHPETC to the findings that the AGO makes during its annual audit of Government agencies. But I would like to ask, in relation to the conclusion that it drew to AHPETC's audit, and I quote from its report, that "The AGO concluded that unless the weaknesses are addressed, there can be no assurance that AHPETC's financial statements are accurate and reliable and that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed."
I would like to seek a clarification from the Member whether he is aware of any other audit conducted by the AGO of a Government Ministry, statutory board or agency that has drawn a similar conclusion.
:
I have drawn example of AGO's reports because I read them every year. It is not meant to be a comparison with AHPETC's AGO report. I have mentioned at the final part – it is not meant a comparison but it is meant to point out that such lapses do exist which I had mentioned that good corporate governance is the work-in-progress. We have accepted the AGO report – we have accepted it and Mr Low Thia Khiang has already stated at the beginning of his speech that we support the motion.
:
Mrs Josephine Teo.
:Mdm Speaker, unless I am completely mistaken sitting right opposite Mr Png when he was speaking, he said something to the effect that in any other report made by the AGO, it would not attract the same level of scrutiny. That is the effect of what he was saying.
And so I seek this very specific clarification. I think it is an important clarification because the audits that the AGO conducts of Ministries and statutory boards is something that is done every single year. The report is tabled to Parliament. And every Ministry or statutory board that has findings has to account for it.
When, in the past, as a Member of the backbench, I had been seated in the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). I can share with Members very honestly and very certainly that Ministries and statutory boards, when they respond to queries, they take a very different attitude and reply to the PAC is a very different tone than the tone that is reflected in the AHPETC's comments to the AGO.
So, I wanted to seek this clarification because Mr Png, it seems to me, has suggested that Ministries and statutory boards have the same problems. But the conclusion drawn by the AGO is a very specific one. It says that unless the weaknesses are addressed, there can be no assurance that AHPETC's financial statements are accurate and reliable and that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed.
I would like to know whether Mr Png is aware of any other occasion that the AGO has drawn the same conclusion for a Government Ministry or statutory board. That is a very important point. Since you raised this point, I hope you will clarify it.
:The AGO report presented to Parliament does not have all those conclusions stated there. If you read the AGO report presented every year, it is all stated there. There is no conclusion for those cases that AGO cited. Some of them they would say they would refer the Police for investigations and some of them will say they would take remedy.
So, likewise, the Workers' Party has said, we have taken measures. Yesterday, Ms Sylvia Lim has highlighted those measures, and what we have done. So, the conclusion that AHPETC got from AGO is there, it is unique, yes – we accepted it. But those examples that I cited are things that AGO picked up too. Are those not real instances where lapses happened too? I am not saying that because it is AHPETC who is tabled in Parliament, but I am citing that AGO's work is thorough, fair and I respect it.
:
Mr Pritam Singh.
:Mdm Speaker, in Minister Khaw Boon Wan's letter to the Minister of Finance dated 18 February 2014, the Minister highlighted four issues in particular that he felt were not addressed by the AHPETC, hereafter referred to as the Town Council. This led to his request to the Minister of Finance to carry out an audit on the Town Council through the Auditor-General's Office (AGO). Ms Sylvia Lim has already spoken on the first two points covering related party transactions and the transfer of sinking funds.
The third issue on the failure to make available accounts and records after the audit period FY2012/2013 available to the Auditor Foo Kon Tan for subsequent event review has been addressed by the AGO. The AGO found no significant matters in these documents that would materially affect the Town Council's FY2012/2013 financial statements. Be that as it may, the Town Council acknowledges the points made by the AGO on this note.
I will speak largely on the fourth matter raised in the Minister's letter to the Finance Minister covering the unexplained differences in the figures under audit amounting to a total exceeding $20 million. This matter overlaps to some extent to the observations made by the AGO, summarised as items 4 and 5 in its main report. This broadly covers the lapses in internal control, procurement and inadequacies in record management and accounting system.
I will deal with these matters focusing on the disclaimers and issues that have the highest financial signature in the spirit of full transparency and accountability to the residents of AHPETC and to Singaporeans. I will also provide some context that the public should be made aware of, acknowledge shortcomings, identify ideas where systemic improvements will be or have already been made and where processes will continue to be enhanced.
First, lift upgrading programme and lift expenses. Mdm Speaker, Foo Kon Tan's fifth disclaimer was on the HDB Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) and covered its inability to determine the accuracy of AHPETC's lift upgrading expenses of about $18.6 million.
To provide some context to this point, the FMSS' staff who previously worked in the Hougang Town Council environment were not familiar with the nature of the billings to HDB for LUP works, as no lift upgrading was carried out in Hougang SMC in the past. Some LUP bills were passed on to FMSS from the previous Managing Agent under the PAP-run Aljunied Town Council. This matter was also brought up in Parliament in 2012 by Ms Sylvia Lim.
In particular, the Town Council was concerned about instances where it was billed one year in advance by the HDB and certain bills were carried over from FY2011 to FY2012, amongst other matters. Accordingly, the Town Council did not recognise LUP expenses in earlier years amounting $8.38 million as the Town Council disputed its share of LUP expenses with the HDB. In view of the very large numbers, one can understand why the Town Council took a cautious approach. The AGO report has since confirmed that the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council has fully paid up the $18.61 million owed to HDB in May 2013 and that this matter has been fully resolved.
Associated with this point is Foo Kon Tan's fourth disclaimer which stated that lift repair expenses of about $1.6 million were expenses that related to the previous financial year and that the Town Council management did not ascertain the quantum of the prior year's expenses and that their expenditure had been over-stated.
The Town Council informed the AGO that some work orders were not raised before 31 March 2012 for works performed in FY2011/2012 due to a staff oversight, explaining the incorrect recording of those expenses. The AGO found out that the actual amount of expenses relating to FY2011/2012 included in the FY2012/2013 audit was actually $63,902 and that the impact of this error in the AGO's words was, I quote, "not significant."
Nonetheless, the AHPETC informed the AGO that with the implementation of the work orders system module on 1 April 2012 for non-routine works, and 1 October 2012 for routine works, lift repair expenses would be accounted for in a timely manner going forward.
Point two, receivables from various stakeholders. The second disclaimer from Foo Kon Tan covered receivables from the Citizens Consultative Committee (CCC), a carry-over largely of the CIPC funding process governed by MND to the previous PAP Aljunied Town Council. The other stakeholders in this disclaimer are the taxman and sundry debtors. The total amount in question under this heading is about $3.1 million.
First, the CCC. The AGO's findings revealed that, in fact, about $614,237 was due from the CCC while the remaining $563,622 were receivables from other parties such as tenants and lessees. Separately, even though the HDB had banked in about $388,887 into the AHPETC's bank account in June and September 2012, the Town Council was unable to match the receipts to the corresponding receivables.
The Town Council would like to acknowledge the AGO's efforts in unravelling this disclaimer and following up with the Ang Mo Kio Town Council which in the aftermath of the AGO's audit and intervention, established that the reimbursement it received from HDB should have originally been made to AHPETC instead by virtue of boundary changes made on the occasion of the 2011 General Elections.
I will deal with the point by the AGO that it was able to unravel the issue of the CCC receivables using documents given to it by AHPETC later in my speech, covering the handover and taking over of records between the old Aljunied Town Council and AHPETC and the management of records in general.
Secondly, on receivables from the taxman, IRAS. Foo Kon Tan noted in its FY2012/2013 audit report that it was not able to ascertain receivables amounting to $110,735. AHPETC acknowledges that these receivables were wrongly stated and that it has duly reversed out these incorrectly stated receivables in May 2014.
Thirdly, on sundry debtors. Foo Kon Tan noted in its FY2012/2013 audit report that it was not able to ascertain about $1.8 billion of receivables from sundry debtors. The AGO found out that the Town Council had incorrectly over-stated about half these receivables and that the Town Council should have been more industrious in recovering payments on a timely basis.
Mdm Speaker, while the Town Council acknowledges this point, a bit of background will be helpful to contextualise this particular issue. When the Town Council upscaled the Hougang Town Council's computer system to replace the terminated system used by the former Aljunied Town Council, the Hougang system had a limited number of categories for Town Council operations. This system was set up for the operation of a single member ward of an Opposition Town Council. The accounting for Government programmes such as the revitalisation of shops, neighbourhood renewal programme and schemes involving Town Council's collaboration with NEA were new and in some cases, unheard to the management of the AHPETC. Like Lift Upgrading, many of these were not extended to Hougang in the past.
Separately, some invoices were the subject of disagreements with the HDB on co-payment for faÃ§ade repair to HDB blocks, and hence were subject to follow-up by the TC resulting in them not being removed as receivables. The Town Council has since informed the AGO that it has received payment from sundry debtors in the two Financial Years after the Foo Kon Tan audit of FY2012/2013, amounting to $508,730, of which $483,134 was owed by the HDB.
Separately, the AGO report noted that about $376,316 remained outstanding to AHPETC from the HDB and NEA respectively, with some owed for more than two years. The AGO's findings also confirmed that NEA had overlooked eight invoices amounting to $11,673 owed to AHPETC. For two particular invoices not rejected by HDB and deemed to be in order, HDB informed the AGO that it was still reviewing claims amounting to $175,067, which it received in May and September 2012, almost two and a half years after they were presented to the HDB by AHPETC.
Mdm Speaker, notwithstanding, the TC has adopted a practice of management regularly churning out a list of debtors and appointing a finance staff to follow up with debtors by issuing reminders on the sums owed. This due diligence will have a positive knock-on effect in ensuring that receivables owed are captured in the accounts to accurately reflect the transactions and state of affairs in the Town Council.
Point three, creditors and accrued expenses. According to Foo Kon Tan's disclaimer, the total amount in question under this head comes to $647,094. The first issue on accrued liabilities covers a claim by Foo Kon Tan that the Town Council did not have a standing operating procedure (SOP) covering the timely recording of liabilities. I will deal with this issue, first.
The AGO has taken a different position from Foo Kon Tan on this point, to correctly report that the Town Council indeed had an SOP, with the qualification that this SOP does not stipulate a timeline for verification works done by property officers after job sheets were received to enable the timely issuance of work orders. I have since personally checked on the SOP with the Town Council's property manager, and confirmed that for the overwhelming number of accrued liabilities, the SOP now puts the timeframe from job completion to issuance of payments to take a maximum of three months.
Secondly, with accruals without work orders. Foo Kon Tan reported that the Town Council was unable to provide details covering some $338,379 in accrued expenses from the previous Aljunied Town Council. The Town Council explained that it was not able to provide the details required as it did not have supporting documents. The AGO was able to find out that some of these items were over-statements, as the Town Council did not reverse out the accrued expenses from its accounts.
As explained earlier, the Town Council was hampered operating a GRC with a manual works order system. With the roll-out of a new works order system in 2012, the Town Council is enhancing its SOPs to ensure that moving forward, an accurate reflection of the amounts due to external parties is established.
Thirdly, on other payables. The AGO found poor monitoring and lack of due diligence by the Town Council in following up on items in a temporary clearing account which Foo Kon Tan noted came up to $308,715. The Town Council has since cleared up many of the receipts, and we will put in resources to clear up the remaining amount.
Mdm Speaker, the TC accepts that proper management involving the handover of records from the previous management was something that on hindsight should have been better addressed. The reality at that time was that many staff who signed for finance-related files from the previous Managing Agent after GE 2011, resigned in 2011 and 2012. With this came the loss of the institutional knowledge specific to documents pertaining to the handover period.
Going forward and in the interest of better corporate governance, the Town Council will monitor the management and handover of records more systematically. To that end, proper handover procedures for resigning staff prior to the issuance of their final pay check have already been implemented.
Before concluding, Mdm Speaker, I wish to say a few words about tenders and contracts as I have been the Chairman of the Tenders and Contracts Committee since 2012. In that context, it would also be appropriate for me to make some comments about the Managing Agent's role in the decision-making process involving the calling of tenders and award of contracts in view of some media reports insinuating personal benefit for FMSS by virtue of being the Managing Agent of AHPETC.
Firstly, in a situation where FMSS is a tenderer in a tender called by the Town Council, as was the case in 2011 for the Managing Agent contract, FMSS is kept at an arm's length and a China wall is built between FMSS and the Town Council. What happens in such a case? The evaluation of such a tender is done solely by the elected and appointed members of the Town Council, all of whom have no interest, pecuniary or otherwise, in FMSS. The decision-making to award the tender in such a case will be the sole remit of the Tenders and Contracts Committee. No staff member of the Managing Agent is privy to the evaluation or decision-making process in this case. The Secretary of the Town Council Mr Danny Loh and its General Manager Ms How Weng Fan are not involved in this process at all.
In 2011, in view of operational exigencies, a decision was made with the concurrence of Town Councillors, and as detailed earlier, FMSS did not participate in the evaluation or recommendation in strict adherence with the Town Council financial rules.
This was the same scenario that played itself out late last year and early this year, when Town Councillors met to evaluate the specifications of the Managing Agent tender for FY2015 and beyond.
In a second scenario where FMSS does not participate in the tenders called by Town Council pertaining for example to conservancy lift maintenance and horticultural contracts, FMSS' role is purely administrative. FMSS is expected to evaluate and assess the tenderers and recommend which tenderers meet the minimum requirements of the Town Council. At no point does FMSS make a decision on whom to award the tender to.
FMSS' administrative role is purely to advise the Tenders and Contracts Committee on the tenderers and their submissions. It is for the Committee to deliberate and determine in the interests of the residents of the Town Council which tenderer the contract ought to be awarded to after considering all the relevant facts. Once again, no personal benefit is accrued to FMSS by virtue of these processes.
Mdm Speaker, I have not covered all the points made by both the AGO and PwC in their reports. But I have focused on the big sum items. This in no way downplays the weight the Town Council places on arrears where there are amounts owing or owed, and for reconciliation or follow-up are lower or less significant.
The Town Council will strengthen its processes and we will do it with the same vigour when we sought to ensure that residents' lives would not be affected during the course of the post GE2011 handover. I would like to thank all the staff of the Town Council, past and present, for their efforts and service to the Town Council. I note that the AGO, with a full-time team working for almost a year, with up to 16 personnel including those from PwC, did not flag out any potential criminal wrong-doing on the part of any staff member of the Town Council.
We will make full use of the AGO's findings to boost our financial systems and processes. Thank you.
:Mdm Speaker, in my 24 years as a lawyer, I have investigated the affairs of a number of companies, including listed companies, and have authored a few audit or investigation reports myself. It has been my experience that lapses are invariably caused by human failings. You may have good systems in place, but ultimately, your systems are only as good as the people who run them.
There will always be individuals who will ignore or try to get around the rules - sometimes because they are lazy or complacent, sometimes because they are incompetent and sometimes, unfortunately, because they are dishonest. Almost always, they are not questioned or challenged because of the positions they occupy. In every case I have been in, losses were suffered.
And so, the findings in the AGO report are depressingly familiar to me. I have read a number of media and online reports which have portrayed the report's findings as "lapses in control", "inadequate oversight" or "poor management of records". Indeed, there are many such findings in that report. But these understate the gravity of the findings.
So, I had planned to come to this House to make the point that these are serious matters. But then I encountered something quite bizarre. The people I discussed the matter with kept telling me – do not attack the Workers' Party; they will only get more sympathy; find a way to move on; you have to keep in mind the politics.
I could not get my head around that. Has it really come to this? This is a matter involving public funds. How could anyone in good conscience ignore or downplay what the AGO and PwC have found? These are not partisan bodies. And Mr Png accepts that. Indeed, AGO routinely audits Government agencies and does not shirk from highlighting lapses, and Members of all parties in this House have rightly criticised those lapses and held the Government to account. So, why should the Workers' Party be let off easy just because they are the Opposition? And why should their residents be forced to accept anything less than full accountability? This cannot be the right way forward.
And sure enough, when Mr Low and Ms Lim spoke yesterday, they tried to downplay the breaches and make excuses for themselves – we are small; we are learning; the system is against us; these are only procedural lapses. That is playing politics. And these excuses are flimsy.
Mr Low says that unlike the PAP Town Councils, the WP cannot find a Managing Agent, very difficult for them. But the Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council does not have a Managing Agent. For the last 19 years, we have been managing the Town Council ourselves. We employ our own staff and ensure that they are trained and have the proper skills to do their job. We are not perfect, but we consistently score an all-green ratings in our TCMRs; our accounts are submitted on time and all the time, are unqualified.
Mr Low also had no Managing Agent when he ran Hougang Town Council. So, this issue of a Managing Agent is a complete red herring. Mr Chen Show Mao, a very experienced corporate lawyer, then suggests the rules on disclosing conflicts are unclear and difficult to apply. But that is not correct. The rules are simple; he must know that. Besides, they have professionals they can turn to for advice. And if the rules are so unclear, why is the AHPETC the only TC with difficulty following them?
So, Mdm Speaker, to me, all these are deflections and distractions. What is more important is what the AGO report actually says. And these findings cannot be brushed off as down to inexperience or a lack of resources. This entire episode raises questions about the competence, accountability and integrity of those who run AHPETC. Minister Shanmugam gave examples yesterday and some are worth re-stating.
First, the appointment of FMSS and FMSI, and their ownership by the Secretary of AHPETC and his wife, who is also the General Manager of FMSS – both hard core Workers' Party members. By any standard of corporate governance, the engagement of FMSS and FMSI involve a conflict of interest. Ms Lim suggests that FMSS was appointed because CPG did not want to continue as Managing Agent. But there is still no explanation as to why FMSS was formed seven days after the election results, and before CPG discontinued its services.
But that is not all. There is nothing wrong per se with an engagement which involves a conflict of interest, provided – and this is critical – it is in the best interests of the organisation, the conflict is fully and properly declared and disclosed, and the risks are managed. The AGO report makes it clear that all this was not done. The AGO report notes that PwC Consulting did not see any documentary evidence that the AHPETC Town Councillors had considered the full extent of the conflicts of interests involved and the safeguards needed. We are still waiting for an explanation why the minutes do not reflect that Mr Loh and his wife's ownership of FMSS was not declared. Still waiting for that.
But that is still not all. We heard the examples yesterday of how the Secretary, General Manager and Deputy General Manager routinely issued works orders and approved payments, effectively, to themselves. Mr Png says there are oversight committees, but PwC was unable to determine if the Chairman and Vice Chairman of AHPETC adequately verified payments to related parties before they sign the cheques.
Mr Png repeats what Ms Lim says, and says that these are over recurring payments, and that if you do not pay them, the rubbish will pile up high. But again, that is not the point. They keep missing the point. Just because there is a contract does not mean you pay blindly. Where is the oversight? In other words, what is the assurance that the very people who are in a conflict did not take advantage of their position? The report makes it quite clear that there was no such assurance. There was no assurance that the services they were being paid for were performed or performed adequately.
In other words, these people were patting themselves on the back while lining their own pockets. And, now, they have all ended up in knots. So, these are egregious breaches that demand a proper explanation, not excuses. And it cannot be a question of inexperience.
Second, was the appointment of FMSS, the party in conflict, in the best interests of the Town Council? The report says that there was no open competition in FMSS' appointment and, therefore, no assurance that AHPETC obtained competitive prices for their services. The report then gives an extraordinary account of how FMSS' fees came to be approved. It states that the AHPETC Town Councillors were assured that FMSS would charge about the same amount as the previous contractors. But this was false. The report notes that the combined fee of the previous contractors was only about $49,000 a month. As it turns out, the fees billed by FMSS for the period from October 2011 to June 2012 averaged $67,000 a month, more than 35% per cent higher. In short, their own Town Councillors were misled. Ms Lim now says all these were errors, rounding-up errors, and so on. But such an error is so flagrant that it certainly raises suspicions and warrants a more thorough investigation.
What is important to appreciate is that it is not the AGO's remit to determine whether dishonesty was involved. And even if we accept that a mistake had been made at the outset, it is hard to believe that the nine months of over-payment was not discovered.
But the worst thing for me in this entire debate – really, the worst thing for me – was that Ms Lim and her team said in response to the AGO report that it confirms that no monies are missing nor has criminal or dishonest activity been uncovered. Mr Low repeated that argument yesterday and I think it is being said
ad nauseam
in this House. This is a consistent line they are giving this House and no doubt to their residents as well.
But this is blatantly misleading on two counts. First, the report says no such thing. In fact, after that statement came out, the AGO responded that Ms Lim's, and I quote, "broad conclusion cannot be derived from AGO's audit".
What does the report in fact say? An important element of the cases I mentioned involves piecing together what went wrong and tracing or figuring out where monies have gone to. By and large, this can be done because almost all transactions leave paper trails, and forensic accountants use documents to analyse, reconstruct and draw a picture of what had happened. But what does the AGO report say about the state of AHPETC documents? I will quote some portions.
At paragraph 5.13, "PwC was not provided with sufficient documentary evidence for it to independently ascertain the manner and extent of verification of the payments at the cheque-signing stage by the Chairman and Vice Chairman."
At paragraph 5.28, "AHPETC did not have a proper system to ensure that documents were properly accounted for and safeguarded. AHPETC was unable to provide supporting documents for the period April to July 2011 to its auditor."
At paragraph 5.31, "AHPETC also could not provide some documents required during the current audit that concerned transactions taking place after AHPETC had taken over from the previous Town Council." So, it has nothing to do with the previous Town Council. "In response to reminders, AHPETC indicated that it could not locate some of the documents and was still looking for others, three months after the request for the documents."
And then the report concludes at paragraph 4.1, I quote, "until the weaknesses are addressed, there can be no assurance that AHPETC's accounts are accurate and reliable, or that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed."
In short, the AGO cannot say if public monies have all been accounted for because documents which AHPETC were obliged to keep are missing. So, contrary to what Ms Lim and her colleagues want the public to believe, the AGO report does not by any stretch confirm that no monies are missing, or that there is no criminal or dishonest activity. Rather, it says that it does not know because of the way the Town Council has mismanaged its operations. If AHPETC considers this an endorsement, then it speaks volumes about its attitude towards managing public funds.
Second, my second problem with that statement, because as Mr Shanmugam explained and as any person with any common sense knows, loss does not only occur when money is stolen. There are numerous instances in the report of possible breach of fiduciary duties by AHPETC officers. We now also know that FMSS was paid far more than other Managing Agents. We now know that there were substantial over-payments to FMSS, which would not have been discovered but for the audit. And we also know that an operating surplus of over $3.2 million has become a deficit of over $700,000. That money is not going to come back. This is something we still have not heard an explanation for. Could there be more examples? We do not know because the accounts for FY2013 have not yet been submitted.
While lapses can occur in all organisations – and I accept that – my experience has also shown me what distinguishes a good organisation is its response to discovering those lapses: failings are acknowledged, systems tightened, losses made good and those responsible dealt with.
So, what was AHPETC's response? First to brush off the many lapses as, I quote, "mistakes and omissions due to inadvertence, human error, IT system constraints and a lack of experience dealing with certain scenarios." And then, second, to misleadingly spin the report as an endorsement that there was no wrong-doing.
It was a blasé response from people charged with handling millions in public funds. They did initially come to this House with a different, more contrite tone – I thought I heard that – and I acknowledge their saying that they will support the motion. But that facade – that facade – completely fell away when Mr Pritam Singh said that he will answer to residents who ask him questions during his house visits and he will not answer the questions posed in this House.
Let me ask Mr Singh this: does this mean that you will keep silent if no one asks you? How many residents does he think would have read the report and fully digested its contents? How many will have the accounting or legal training to know the full implications of the report and know the right questions to ask? And is your answer going to be, to every question asked, "Do not worry, AGO said no wrong-doing"?
The real question is how is the WP team going to account to their residents? In fact, not just their residents, it should be all Singaporeans because half of their revenue comes from Government grants which we all contribute to. Make no mistake, if this had been any other company – if this had been any other company – the directors would have been immediately removed and a Receiver appointed to protect its assets. No doubt about it, this happens many times in the private sector, and I do not think anyone will dispute that.
The AGO has explained why it does not know certain things because it has not been shown the documents. Ms Lim and her colleagues attempt to play down and rewrite the findings in the AGO report. Their attempts, really, do not change the findings themselves and certainly does not make things right.
If Ms Lim and her team are truly for transparency and accountability, which they say they are, they should help all of us understand what really happened, not obfuscate, deflect and distract. We should not forget that we are dealing with hard-earned public funds and, ultimately, the interests and welfare of Singaporeans living in Ajunied, Hougang and Punggol East. They did no wrong and they deserve better. The answer cannot be same-old, same-old, business as usual or "I will improve going forward". That cannot be the answer or, at least, the complete answer.
Most of all, Ms Lim, Mr Singh and the entire team, they need to assure this House that no public funds under their care have been lost, misappropriated or are unaccounted for, and that AHPETC has not suffered loss in the real sense and not the narrow sense they want to use.
They have said much in this House – many speakers, all of them have had their say – but they have carefully avoided saying that there has been no loss. And if they can give that assurance – that there has been no loss – then they must tell us how they know. How are they able to give that assurance given the findings in the AGO report, the missing documents, their own auditors refusal to sign off on the audit and their own inability to say when the accounts for Financial Year 2013 will be ready?
Despite all their claims that everything is hunky-dory, it will be done, they still cannot give a commitment as to when those accounts will be ready. And if they cannot give a complete and satisfactory answer to the highly relevant questions Mr Shanmugam posed, then something must be done. It is now close to four years since they took over. I do not know if there is a statute of limitations for excuses, but they must have long exceeded it.
What is right and only thing to do? Do what any responsible company and Board of Directors in such a situation would do – for AHPETC to commission a complete forensic investigation and, thereafter, undertake legal proceedings to recover all losses and damages suffered by it, regardless of who the potential or prospective defendant may be.
The WP team should also procure an undertaking from FMSS and FMIS that they will make all their papers and their staff available for that investigation. That is the only way to put this matter to rest. I really hope, for the sake of the residents, that the result will be that AHPETC has suffered no loss, or will be able to recover their losses – that is good for the residents. But we need to do that investigation and find out. But if WP is not willing to do this, then that says everything.
Mdm Speaker, last year, we debated in this House what constructive politics means and how we would like to see our political landscape evolve. The motion reflects an intention and desire to do what is necessary for the good of Singapore and for Singaporeans. But it is not enough for the Workers' Party to simply say they support the motion. If they mean what they say, they must follow through by doing everything they can to ensure that all the questions posed – all the legitimate questions posed – have been answered and this entire mess is cleaned up once and for all. Thank you.
:
Ms Lee Li Lian. Mr Pritam Singh, you have a clarification?
:Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Mdm Speaker, with regard to the point made by the hon Member, the Workers' Party members have come to Parliament and we are taking collective responsibility for all the issues that affect our Town Council. We are not here to make excuses and I have said we will work towards cleaning up the accounts in my speech. We acknowledge the lapses and we will put things right. That is the message that I want to give to the Member.
The second issue was a point made about this figure of $733,000 from the old Aljunied 2010 accounts and the deficit of $3.3 million in the 2012 accounts of the Aljunied-Punggol East Town Council. Can I just confirm which document the Member is reading these figures out from before I give the Member a reply, please? Thank you.
: Mdm Speaker, I acknowledge what the hon Member has said. They have come to this House to answer the questions they can answer or are willing to answer. They have not answered the questions – all the questions that we have posed to them – and they are certainly not answering the questions that they do not want to answer. And all I need to ask them to do is to pick up
Hansard
of Mr Shanmugam's speech where he has posed a number of very highly relevant, very legitimate questions and just answer those. That is a good start, and I invite him to do that today, if not today, then in the near future, and not six months or 12 months down the road.
On the second point, I was restating the figures given by Mr Khaw in his speech where he made it clear that the Aljunied Town Council had an operating surplus – an operating surplus – of over $3.2 million, and it has now become an operating deficit of over $700,000 after the Workers' Party took over.
:
Thank you very much for that. Minister Khaw, can I then put the question to you, Sir, which document are you referring to just for us to be clear on this before I reply to this point? Thank you.
:
Thank you. May I refer you to the AGO report, main report, page three?
: Thank you, Minister. Minister, those figures originated from the income and expenditure statements for Financial Year 31 March 2012, Financial Year 31 March 2013. Now, if we look into those figures, that is correct for 2010 under the previous Aljunied Town Council. If we look at the operating expenditure, there five heads. Cleaning Works under the previous Aljunied Town Council was $5.1 million dollars; under the AHPETC in 2012 was $6.7 million. For Lift Maintenance, it was $1.8 million in 2010 and $4 million in 2012. That is a rise of about $2.1 million to $2.2 million. Water and electricity was $8.9 million in 2010 and it was $10.1 million in 2012. It was a larger town by 2012, so that explains that. There are two other heads, but let me deal with the one which has the largest cost increase, which is lift maintenance.
I remember sometime in 2012, there was an episode where a lift did not home to the correct floor. There was a resident in the lift. This was in Paya Lebar, if my memory serves me right. In 2011, I beg your pardon. And the resident, of course, had a very jarring experience. At that point, the Members of Parliament got to know about it and we were quite concerned about safety issues involving lifts and lift maintenance. So the Town Council commissioned the consultant to try and understand our lift maintenance contracts, lift maintenance procedures, whether there was any problem with them and what we could do to improve the situation.
And at that point, it was determined that for the novated contract from the Aljunied Town Council, it had third party who was looking after all the lifts in the town and we had a lot of different types of lifts, as I am sure the other Town Councils do – 9G lifts, Mitsubishi lifts, Sigma lifts, EM Services, Otis, Fujitec, and it goes on and on, of course. So, the recommendation that was made to the Town Council was to try as far as possible to ensure that for lift maintenance, get the original equipment manufacturer to be maintaining those lifts. And this was quite an important consideration for us because we were noticing that the lift downtimes for lifts which were maintained by this third party contractor were rather long.
:
Mr Singh, you have to keep your clarification short and not make a speech.
:
Yes. I will finish up very shortly. Because of those downtimes, we decided, "Look, we have to probably invest a bit more money and try and make sure that our lift maintenance procedures and contracts are up to the mark or up to the satisfaction of the Members of Parliament. And that really explains the large jump of about $2.2 million. It is the largest jump in the operating expenditure. And that explains that figure. Thank you.
:
Mr Hri Kumar.
:
Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Can I get a clarification of Mr Singh's clarification? He has asked me a question, I have answered him. I have asked him whether he is going to answer the questions which Mr Shanmugam posed and when is he going to answer those questions.
:
Mdm Speaker, I have made it clear that we all ---
Mr Low Thia Khiang rose
:
Mr Low, you want to take the floor?
:
Mdm Speaker, as Mr Pritam Singh said, we will take collective responsibility as a team. I do not see any Member of Parliament should need to answer any individual questions.
:
Ms Lee Li Lian.
:Thank you, Madam. Finally, I get to speak. I reiterate what my fellow party colleagues had all said before me, that is, the Town Council acknowledges that there are areas for improvements which were highlighted by the audit. Going forward, we are committed to improving the processes and have, indeed, taken on some measures already.
There are two parts to my speech. Part one, is to address some of the disclaimers pointed out by AGO and what the Town Council has since done to improve the system and work processes. Next, I will also be touching on my experience on unforeseen challenges faced by Opposition Town Councils.
Number one: disclaimers flagged out by AGO. I refer to Appendix A of the AGO's report, disclaimers 8, 9 and 10 and what the Town Council has since done to improve our systems and work processes. These are information already publicly available.
Disclaimer 8: income taxes. The Town Council had since engaged a tax agent to prepare the income tax computations for FY2012/2013 as well as FY 2013/2014.
Disclaimer 9: goods and services taxes. Some of these problems arose because the former Finance Manager who is familiar with the GST submissions had unfortunately resigned. Going forward, the Town Council will have to work with our IT vendor to split the GST for routine and Sinking Fund income or expenses in the system. Several of our TC Finance team are also now familiar with the apportionment formula required by IRAS. Systems and processes for out-going staff have been put in place as mentioned earlier by my fellow colleague Mr Pritam Singh.
Disclaimer 10: cash and bank balances. AHPETC recognised that it is good control practice for bank reconciliation to be independently reviewed and for the reviewer to sign off and date on the bank reconciliation statement as evidence of review. When Aljunied-Hougang Town Council was formed in 2011, the merger resulted in the TC inheriting several bank accounts from the former management, in addition to those from Hougang Town Council. These accounts were mainly used for receipts and payments. To streamline the accounts, the Town Council decided to close unnecessary accounts, leaving only four accounts, that is, one operating fund and one Sinking Fund account each with two banks. Since mid-2013, Town Council has been doing monthly bank reconciliation at the account level for each of these four accounts.
I move on to Appendix B of the AGO report on Internal Controls, points 5, 6 and 7.
Point 5: weak controls over cheques received. The Town Council noted AGO's observations and had improved upon its safeguarding of cheques received by mail. Cheques not banked in by the end of the day are now placed in the safe. As an additional control, all cheques received are scanned by Finance staff into a central server. Currently, the reception area is already monitored by CCTV, which would be able to detect unauthorised personnel accessing mails received.
Point 6: surprise examinations not carried out in accordance with Town Councils Financial Rules. The TC has noted this observation and will implement surprise checks by the TC Secretary or his representative at every branch office at least once a financial year. A senior Finance staff had gone to each branch office in FY2013 and FY2014 to conduct a surprise check on cash collections and balances.
Point 7: weak controls over access to strong room and safe. There were already written authorisations by the Secretary to various officers to hold the keys to the strong room in the TC HQ and Finance rooms and safes at TC HQ as well as the branches. TC has since enhanced its controls and obtained Chairman's and Secretary's authorisations for access to the strong rooms and safes.
Next, Madam, I move on to unforeseen challenges. I had my first "surprise" shortly after the Punggol East By-Election in January 2013. I was on the ground shortly after to meet representatives from the then conservancy contractor for both SK 1 and SK 2. SK 1 refers to blocks 101 to 141 and SK 2 refer to blocks 142 to 197.
We were informed by the contractor from SK 1 that because of issues they were having with the Ministry of Manpower, they were not able to continue their contract with us.
As AHPETC was going to take over only from May 2013, the TC requested the handing over Town Council, that is, Pasir Ris Punggol TC, to call for a tender for SK 1 in March. Subsequently, two established cleaning companies tendered for the contract.
The tenderers were invited to attend the tender meeting in late April 2013, just before the handover in May. Unfortunately, representatives were sent from both companies to inform that they were no longer able to participate in the tender and would like to withdraw from the tender process. It was also followed up by written notices to the TC Chairman on their decision to withdraw without any valid reasons.
AHPETC had no choice but to respect the company's decision to withdraw. As the incumbent conservancy contractor had to cease their services by end June 2013, TC then needed to quickly make a decision to invite companies to tender; otherwise no one will be clearing rubbish and cleaning lifts! This is just one of the many challenges anOpposition Town Council faces.
On the other hand, I am pleased to note that EMSU services provided by the previous contractor continued their services in Punggol East. Regardless of political affiliations, residents' interests should always be the priority and there should not be elements of political preference or fear. It will be sad if there are elements of fear when bidding for a project in Opposition Town Councils.
In conclusion, Madam, we respect the findings made by AGO. In response, I want to emphasise that the Town Council has already made changes to work processes, systems and procedures to address specific lapses. With that, I would like to end off my speech by thanking all the staff who were involved in this rigorous audit process.
: Order. I propose to take the break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 4.00 pm.
Sitting accordingly suspended
at 3.40 pm until 4.00 pm.
Sitting resumed at 4.00 pm.
:
Speaker, may I seek your consent and the general assent of Members here to move that the time limit in respect of Standing Orders 48(8) be removed in respect of the next speaker Minister Heng's speech?
: I give my consent. Does the Leader of the House have the general assent of hon. Members present to so move?
indicated assent.
With the consent of Mdm Speaker and the general assent of Members present, question put and agreed to.
Resolved, that the proceedings on the item under discussion be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order 48(8) in respect of the Minister's speech. – [Dr Ng Eng Hen]
: Mdm Speaker, I rise to speak because I am concerned about the well-being and interests of the residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East. I am concerned about their lives and their homes. They have been short-changed by their Members of Parliament and they have been kept in the dark. I am concerned about the well-being and interests of all Singaporeans. Elected Members of Parliament are expected to be clean and honest and to act with integrity.
This motion boils down to one word – trust. The people trust that the Members of Parliament will keep their promises with integrity. The people trust that we will take seriously our full responsibility to serve our people and to serve their best interests. So, I am sad to observe that elected Town Councillors of AHPETC have betrayed the people's trust.
They betrayed the people's trust in three ways. One, they betrayed the people's trust by failing to act in the best interests of the residents. Two, they betrayed the people's trust with a consistent pattern of evasive behaviour. Third, they betrayed the people's trust by promising one thing and doing another.
First, the Workers' Party has betrayed the trust of the residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East. The residents cannot trust the Workers' Party on several counts. For a start, residents cannot trust the Workers' Party to get them a good deal. In fact, the Workers' Party has gotten them a raw deal. Their Managing Agents, FMSS and FMSI, charged the highest rate in Singapore for their services. Compared to the MA fees paid by other Town Councils, residents paid more than $2 more a unit – one year, $1.6 million – and this went on for four years. Now, till now, after all the debate in the House, the public does not know, none of us knows, the reasons why FMSS and FMSI's rates are higher than everywhere else.
Residents cannot trust elected Town Councillors not to sacrifice their long-term interests. In fact, these long-term interests are being sacrificed. Twelve million dollars went missing from their Sinking Fund. $12 million. Missing. It was only after the AGO pointed this out, that this was put back. And even so, one year after the financial year has ended, they still owed a substantial sum to the Sinking Fund.
If not for the Auditor-General, the Town Councillors – the elected Town Councillors – would have kept the residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East in the dark. Nothing is transparent.
Now, this is a very serious matter. It is wrong for the Town Councillors to argue that as long as money was put back, nothing was wrong in the first instance. The fact is they put the money back only because they were caught. Why did this happen? Either the MA is totally incompetent or they deliberately decided not to fill the Sinking Fund to show a better financial picture and have a large operating account to pay for expenses, the largest item being the MA fees. This happened because the TC was running into cash flow problems from their profligate management and they put off paying into the Sinking Fund, so that they may have money to pay? Now, really that is compromising the long-term interests of residents to enrich their friends.
They did not forget to pay MA fees every month. They did not forget to collect S&CC from the honest, hardworking residents every month. But they forgot to pay large sums that were supposed to go into the Sinking Fund, and repeatedly. Was it because the Finance and Investment Committee chaired by Mr Chen Show Mao was not doing its work? Or was it another lapse by the Chairman? No explanation has been forthcoming.
Now, this is serious. Sinking Funds are for long-term cyclical maintenance. We need to replace lifts for residents' safety, do major repairs like re-wiring and re-roofing, repaint blocks. The safety and well-being of residents and their homes are at stake.
Down the line, residents may find their Sinking Fund is all depleted, with nothing left to maintain the town safety and their well-being. When this happens, who suffers? Not the Town Council, not the MA. Who suffers are the residents. Worse of all, they would not know where the money has all gone.
Now, this is a serious matter. In fact the Town Council Act lists only three offences and the use of Sinking Funds for operating expenses is one of them. It is precisely to guard against Managing Agents and Town Councils acting to meet short term interests. Sadly, this is precisely what we are seeing – short-term, opportunistic behaviour.
Residents cannot trust the elected Town Councillors to account honestly for where their money is. The Town Council cannot even keep basic accounts properly. You saw in the AGO report -- inaccurate arrears, lapses in internal controls, poor records, late accounts, missing documents. These are not technical issues – these raise fundamental questions about whether the accounts can be trusted. All of this money comes from the people in one way or another – whether it is S&CC that residents pay or the Sinking Fund that was built up over the years, from money paid by residents or the Government grants that MND provides out of taxpayers' money.
We cannot even trust the books. We are in the dark on the true state of affairs. If we are not vigilant, can we be sure that down the road, somebody may not be cooking the books? Why did a surplus of $3.3 million in the operations become a deficit of $730,000 in just two years? Mr Pritam Singh attributed everything to lift upgrading. Now, we must naturally ask, "Where did the money go?" We have asked, but we have not had a good answer. Though it may not be obvious on the surface, beneath the surface, the Town Council is rotting. And the rot is serious.
I am also very concerned about the second way the Workers' Party has betrayed the people's trust. The pattern of behaviour; the consistent pattern of denial, deflection and protection of the Managing Agent which suggests a serious rot is happening. Clearly, the Managing Agent FMSS has failed. The elected Members of the Town Council should be held responsible. They appointed the MA. They are responsible for supervising the MA, for setting up a proper structure. You can outsource work; you cannot outsource responsibility. The responsibility lies squarely with the Members of Parliament on the council.
Why did the elected Town Councillors allow such a deeply flawed structure to be set up in the very first place? We have not heard any good answer. Yesterday, Ms Lim said the ACRA record of FMSS was tabled. Was it discussed at any Town Council meeting? Was it debated? I think she has not given us the full truth.
The elected Town Councillors, instead of disciplining their MA and taking corrective action, defended them strongly. In 2013, they said, in Parliament, and I quote. "FMSS was engaged based on its directors' experience in property management, professional skills and track record in running Hougang Town Council."
What we have heard in this House so far is that they are inexperienced and these mistakes happened because people resigned. But Ms Sylvia Lim assured us in this House that they are professional and experienced. So, who is telling us the accurate version? And you are talking about experience. How much experience do you need to know that you cannot be handing money to your supporters, at the expense of over-charging your residents? How much experience do you need to truthfully disclose information to your auditors – including your own auditors? In fact, the AGO audit would not have been necessary if you had been honest and forthright in disclosing information to your own auditors. Where is the transparency that Mr Pritam Singh has been advocating so strongly?
Elected Town Councillors have acted in the best interests of their friends, the well-paid Managing Agent. They have neglected the interests of the residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East. Can residents trust that you are acting in their interests? Why are you so protective? Why are they so protective of their expensive Managing Agent that messed up the Town Council's work? Because they are their party supporters and friends?
Yesterday, in this House, Ms Sylvia Lim rejected the suggestion that the arrangement with FMSS was to benefit their friends. So, may I ask: are they your friends, or at least, were they? Yes? Did they benefit? Yes, richly so. The structure that the Workers' Party set up allowed this to happen. You awarded contracts at these exorbitant rates and allowed them to get away with it. What other conclusions can be drawn?
Now, on the other side, we know that AHPETC's financial position, even based on your own figures, which may not be the most reliable, has deteriorated sharply. The finances are now in the red. From a surplus of $3.3 million in the operations, it has now become a deficit of $730,000 in just two years. It is astounding. Two short years.
The Workers' Party asserted that no money was lost. Now what is astounding is how they even twisted the comments of the AGO to justify their case. Mr Hri Kumar has dealt with this earlier on, but Mr Pritam Singh continued to repeat this. I urge you to read the auditor's report carefully.
At the very least you would agree with that it is not honest to twist the AGO's comments deliberately in this self-serving way.
All the Workers' Party Members of Parliament have said that they would take collective responsibility. They have said that they would support this Motion. I hope the support is in substance, not just form. If they support the Motion in substance, one would have expected that they will conduct a forensic audit, that they will take legal action against the Managing Agent FMSS; that they will file accounts immediately, on time, as required by the law and any administrative action; that they will put in place checks and balances where there is a severe conflict of interest. And their residents deserve to know what had happened. Are you prepared to come clean and explain and answer all the questions which have been raised in this House? How exactly will you safeguard the interest of residents?
The third way that the Workers' Party betrayed the trust of our people is that they promise one thing and do another, quite the opposite. They say something in one forum, then, in another forum, they say something else.
The Workers' Party's platform in the last General Election was First World Parliament where the Opposition will, I quote, "function as a robust check and balance against the Government". Over the last two days, we have seen so clearly how they have created a system where there is no check, no balance. You cannot even check yourself, or are you not willing to check yourself? They have been entrusted with running a Town Council. Where is the First World Town Council that they should be delivering? Instead, we have a Town Council who cannot account for where the resources go to.
And, in fact, the real check in this instance came from the Government, the Auditor-General's Office. You have a pattern of behaviour where you did not answer to your own auditors, as a result of which the Auditor-General had gone in. If not for the Auditor-General's Office, Singaporeans would not have discovered this mess that the elected Town Councillors have created.
The Workers' Party also spoke vigorously about accountability, but surely, you will agree that the most basic aspect of accountability is the ability to keep proper accounts of the money that have been entrusted to you. I can understand if you are keeping accounts for the first time, but you are not – you have told residents of your experience in running Hougang Town Council. So till today, we do not know the true state of accounts of AHPETC.
The Workers' Party said one thing and did another. Are they consistent with their statements? Mr Low started the debate yesterday by saying that he will be accountable. And then, immediately, Ms Sylvia Lim tried to explain away all their failings. Mr Low said that he will account in Parliament and, indeed, Ms Lim told the press earlier that the Workers' Party will explain in Parliament. But Mr Singh said in Chamber yesterday that he would only answer to his residents door-to-door. In fact, Mr Pritam Singh spoke about transparency, that the Workers' Party will press the Government for as much information as possible. But they do not even provide information to their own auditors. What the House witnessed yesterday is unbelievable. Unbelievable. Mr Pritam Singh had said this, and I quote, "We will constantly press the Government for more information especially since it is so selective with the information it releases." When asked pertinent questions on transparency and accountability by Mr Shanmugam, Mr Pritam Singh said that he would not give a reply in Parliament – the First World Parliament which he claims he wants to build, and which Mr Low Thia Khiang said he would account to. He refuses to answer to Parliament. So, why is Mr Singh so selective about where he answers his questions?
One of my colleagues bumped into Mr Yee Jenn Jong a month ago. When he asked him about the Town Council, he evaded the question and gave him a non-answer, "Answer will be given at the right time and at the right place." And when pressed that he was a Workers' Party's Central Executive Committee member and should have asked the Party Chairman to know what is going on, he said this, and I quote, "It is a matter for the elected Members."
Just last evening, Mr Yee Jenn Jong and a group of his Workers' Party's supporters, dressed in blue, were asked by a resident last night about what was going on in the AHPETC. But he did not answer and walked away quickly. So, is this the answer Mr Singh promised to residents? A WP CEC member and his activists met residents and they evaded the question. So, would not answer auditors. Would not answer Parliament. Would not answer residents. Who is left in Singapore that the Workers' Party think is worthy of an answer?
Sadly, we saw in this House yesterday this pattern of behaviour of saying whatever suits them for the moment, among the Workers' Party's Members of Parliament.
Mr Low Thia Khiang claimed that it is difficult for the Opposition to run Town Councils, or get qualified people to run Town Councils, that they have to start from scratch. But the PAP Town Councils also started from scratch when they were first formed. The PAP Town Councillors had no experience in municipal administration. But they had plenty of integrity and sense of responsibility. Mr Low said that we must therefore de-politicise the transitioning process. Newly elected Members of Parliament should not be tested, implying that they should simply be elected to oppose the Government in a First World Parliament, and not to have to show that they can actually govern.
This is the precise opposite of the philosophy of the Town Council scheme. Indeed, it is the opposite of what Mr Low Thia Khiang used to maintain, running Hougang Town Council for 20 years until the Workers' Party's team messed up in AHPETC: that, contrary to what the PAP thinks and claims, there is nothing to running Town Councils, and the Opposition run them as well as any PAP Town Councils and, therefore, people should vote for them. Mr Low calls for the Town Council issue to be de-politicised, but he is politicking. How can he be disclaiming responsibility to govern locally while asserting the right to challenge the Government nationally?
What is even more disturbing is what the Workers' Party's Members of Parliament have been promising residents.
Let me just quote three examples. The first quote: "The Workers' Party has over 20 years of experience in managing Town Councils well. And not just small Town Councils, but a huge GRC Town Council in Aljunied. We know the ins and outs of running a constituency. Even when obstacles were thrown in our path to trip us up, we have still managed to ensure residents' needs are well taken care of." This was by Mr Gerald Giam when he spoke to residents at a rally on 23 January 2013.
Now, earlier on, we heard Mr Png Eng Huat spell out all the difficulties. But your fellow colleagues, your fellow Party Members, said, "We know the ins and outs of running a constituency. Even when obstacles are thrown into our path to trip us up, we managed." But why are you attributing all the problems that you have to staff resigning, to difficulties, to challenges in IT system, and so on? I do not understand.
Let me move on to a second quote: "If WP wins Punggol East, I am confident that we will manage the Town Council competently. WP has had more than 20 years of experience managing Hougang SMC. After GE 2011, we quickly adapted to take charge of Aljunied GRC under a very short timeframe. We will take over the Town Council functions with as little disruption as possible to the residents. I have the experience and the know-how in running a Town Council." This was by Ms Lee Li Lian at the same rally to residents in January 2013.
So, we have heard that you can take charge of a Town Council, a big one too, under a very short timeframe. So, all the explanations that all the Workers' Party's Members have given us so far – which is the correct version? That you have plenty of problems, plenty of challenges or that you can take charge within a very short timeframe, that you can overcome any obstacle and that you have no disruption, and that you are experienced and have the know-how? Which is the correct version, may I ask?
Let me mention a third quote: "Workers' Party MPs are committed to being politically accountable to voters for town management under the current regime. Whatever else is done in other countries, the responsibility for town management has been legislated to the MPs under the TCA. We accept this responsibility and have pledged during elections to manage town councils entrusted to us to the best of our ability. We intend to continue keeping this promise." We accept responsibility – we intend to continue keeping this promise. This is by Ms Sylvia Lim in the parliamentary session on 13 May 2013. So, as you can see, these are all quite recent.
So, I was most astounded to hear what Mr Low Thia Khiang said yesterday in this House – that we should de-politicise, we should look at the transitioning and all that. So, Mr Low, you are the Secretary General of the Workers' Party, and have just said the exact opposite of what Ms Sylvia Lim, Chairman of the Workers' Party, said in this House in 2013. Did you just change your mind when things went wrong in AHPETC, or you never believed in what you were doing? Or were Mr Gerald Giam, Ms Lee Li Lian and Ms Sylvia Lim misleading residents when they made those speeches, and the Workers' Party had no intention whatsoever of fulfilling your promises? So, can you tell this House, and all Singaporeans, what are your real beliefs and values?
Do you have any conviction? Or do you just say whatever is expedient for the moment even if it means misleading Singaporeans? Is it not dishonest to claim that you believe in something and do the opposite, and to say one thing in one forum and a completely different thing on another occasion?
There also seems to be several versions of the Workers' Party floating around. Which one do we trust? The one that claims to be transparent and accountable, which wants to build a First World Parliament; or the one that politicks and says whatever is convenient? The one that politicks, like Mr Pritam Singh, who tries to avoid answering in Parliament but is prepared to say whatever he wants, and to whomever he wants, outside. So, which Workers' Party is the true Workers' Party?
What is most disturbing in this entire sorry episode is the way that the Workers' Party has sought to downplay the crux of the matter, sought to deflect the issue by playing victim to a challenging operating environment that the Opposition faced, and then claiming inexperience.
Let me recount what happened in the House yesterday. Mr Low started with a clever opening to play victim – that the Opposition faced a challenging operating environment, and that is why they had these lapses. And then he insinuated that Town Councils are politicised, and he then took an entirely different line from what Ms Sylvia Lim and the rest of the Members of Parliament have been saying.
Ms Sylvia Lim went through a lot of details on the various AGO observations, circulated an action plan and promised to do better. Ms Lim said that Sinking Funds have been put back but she never told anyone of us that they were caught by their own auditor and then the AGO for not putting money into the Sinking Fund. They were forced to put the money back.
Ms Lim and the other Members of Parliament never answered the critical question – were all Town Councillors aware of the structure of the ownership of FMSS that leads to substantial over-payment, and was there a proper discussion on how you were going safeguard the interests of the residents?
And Ms Lim sought to show that the lapses were technical, bean-counting and the Workers' Party would fix them by hiring more accountants and doing more checks. And then, of course, that is a dodge. And then, of course, we heard from the other Members of Parliament as well.
Ms Lim also circulated a table showing various committees and formal checks. Reading it, I was very impressed. I would like to point out to this House that the AGO report indicated that as of 12 December 2014, the last Finance and Investment Committee meeting was held in April 2014. They did not meet for eight months, but the table that Ms Lim circulated said they met monthly. This is in the AGO report – you can read that. So, is this another instance of saying one thing and doing another?
So, sadly, we saw – and today – we heard Mr Pritam Singh, we heard Mr Png Eng Huat – they explained all the technical details, they sought to deflect, but they never got to the heart of the issue. They never got to answer the questions that need to be answered. I was hoping that Mr Pritam Singh would change his mind and tell us today, but he did not.
So, we saw a big
wayang
in this House. Ordinarily, such a
wayang
would have been comical. But in the context of how important integrity and trust is in how we govern this little red dot, I am so disappointed, I am so saddened by this entire sorry saga. What we are seeing are not isolated lapses of behaviour. What we are seeing is a troubling pattern of dishonest misleading behaviour – to say one thing but to do the opposite. To say one thing that suits them to residents, then to say a different thing in Parliament or elsewhere when it suits them better.
This is wrong. This is a serious problem of integrity. It costs the Workers' Party nothing to promise the world. But there is a real cost to Singaporeans – real lives are affected – when they break their promises.
Let me now conclude with why this motion is important for all Singaporeans.
At the Ministry of Education and in our schools – tens of thousands of teachers spend many, many hours striving to provide the best possible education for our children, so that they may have a better future. Hundreds of thousands of parents are concerned about their children's future. We spend day and night thinking about our children's future. But our children can only have a better future if Singapore as a nation succeeds and remains relevant to the world. That we retain the values and the qualities that are essential for our success.
We have seen how in many countries – when elected officials engage in self-serving practices, when they put their interests ahead of the public interest, when they do not act with integrity and when they put the interests of their cronies first – the country fails. And it is the man in the street and the young and the future generation who suffer the most.
As a little red dot, good governance is critical to Singapore's future. Elected public officials must act with integrity and a deep sense of responsibility, and serve our people whole-heartedly. In the many decisions we take, there may be errors – human or system – but what matters most is that elected officials act with integrity and do our very best to serve the public interest.
As Minister Khaw Boon Wan pointed out yesterday, a Town Council requires elected Members of Parliament to govern and not just politick. It is easy to shout campaign slogans and make all sorts of promises, but do you really believe in what you say whole-heartedly and walk the talk? Running a Town Council in a clean, competent and accountable way is a test of the integrity of the Member of Parliament and his sense of responsibility and accountability. In other words, can we trust him or her?
This motion is not about partisan politics – I have no joy pointing out the many failings and questionable practices of the Workers' Party. This motion is important for all Singaporeans because it is about our long-term future. Unless elected Members of Parliament act with integrity and a deep sense of responsibility, and take the trust of the people seriously, we will not be able to maintain a system of good governance – clean, honest, accountable, competent – and pass this on to our future generations. We must not betray the trust of Singaporeans. Singaporeans deserve better. So let us all honour the trust that Singaporeans have placed in us. Mdm Speaker, I support the motion.
:
Mr Low Thia Khiang.
:
Thank you, Madam. I have a clarification. I remember Minister mentioned that there was $12 million lost. May I clarify whether he meant $12 million lost from the Town Council's account? Does he mean that?
:
Mdm Speaker, I said that if you looked at the accounts, $12 million was missing from the Sinking Fund, and this was caught by the Auditor-General.
:
Missing from the Sinking Fund – was it missing or lost from the Town Council?
:
I said that it was missing. I hope that you have read the Auditor-General's report because it was very clear that the $12 million that ought to be put into the Sinking Fund was not there, was missing from the Sinking Fund, and the Auditor-General had to say, "You have to put this back." The rules are very clear as to when you have to put into the Sinking Fund. And even despite the reminders from the Auditor-General, you were late. And even now, not all of it has been put back.
:
Thank you. So, it is the $12 million that ought to be put back into the Sinking Fund. The $12 million is in the operating fund account. [
Interruption
] But it is not missing from the Town Council.
:
As I have said, if not for the Auditor-General doing this audit, Singaporeans would have been kept in the dark about what happened to your Sinking Fund. Singaporeans would have been kept in the dark. The residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East would have been kept in the dark.
:
Mdm Speaker, I disagree. It will never be kept in the dark. You have to submit the audited accounts anyway. Yes, eventually, you will have to submit the accounts.
:
That is indeed so, that you have to submit the audited accounts. But you did not. Your accounts were late for two years in a row. The first audit had four disclaimers, and the second had 13. So, from year to year, it got from bad to worse.
:
Yes, it had not been submitted. We admit that, and we explained why was it so. And we are here today and yesterday in this House to explain and to account for why we were in the situation as it is. We take the report of the AGO very seriously. We have shown that we have dealt with the problem and improvements have been made.
: As I had indicated in my speech, Mdm Speaker, there are many issues which the residents and Singaporeans deserve a straight answer. How is it that the Managing Agent (MA) rates that you are paying to FMSS are so much higher than anywhere else? Where did the money go? Where did it come from? And how was such a structure created in the first instance? And how did the financial position of the Town Council deteriorate so quickly within two short years? Those are the critical issues.
Why FMSS was set up? Why was it set up the way it was? First and foremost, whether the elected Members of the Town Council even disclosed this ownership to everybody in the Town Council? Was it debated amongst the Town Councillors, all of them, not just one or two of them? Were actions taken to ensure that proper safeguards were put in place? What happened to all the money? All these are critical questions.
So, we heard, indeed, we heard a lot of technical explanations which essentially gave the impression that this was a technical issue. As I had said, this is not a technical issue. This issue is about integrity. It is about trust. It is about our convictions and our beliefs. Our convictions and our beliefs that, as elected Members of Parliament, we are here to serve the people of Singapore, not our friends.
:
Madam, we have explained yesterday and today the oversight mechanism of the Town Council, and that the MA contracts are tendered out. We tendered out the MA contract and this is the result of the tender. We also have done due diligence to look at the MA tender. So, this is what we have done. We have done our part. But, of course, we admit that the account is long overdue. We have accepted that and we accepted the AGO's finding, and we will look into the issue.
:
So, the question is: did the elected Members of the Town Council of AHPETC overpay? And do you accept that the figures that were circulated yesterday that, perhaps, you have overpaid by at least $1.6 million a year, over four years, to your Managing Agent? And if you do, and if you support this motion fully, what action will you be taking to recover the monies? I think that deserves a straight answer.
:
Madam, may I?
: Yes.
:Madam, first of all, I would like to clarify that what Minister said about us not transferring monies into Sinking Fund until we were caught by the AGO, it is not correct. We actually made some transfers before even the AGO audit commenced. Of course, it is true that we did not make the transfers on time; it was not done deliberately. As I mentioned in the House yesterday, we thought that it was acceptable to keep the monies in the Operating Fund, pay Sinking Fund expenses out of there and then net the thing off. I think I said that in my speech. So, there was some misunderstanding on our part of that but we admit that the rule, read strictly, is clear and that we should have done the quarterly transfer.
Secondly, in respect of the MA rates, we actually did our checks at the time that the tender was awarded. We looked at the rates that were being charged. Although we noted that the rates were at a higher end, but we had the rates that were charged, for example, in Pasir Ris-Punggol from 2011 to 2014. And the rates that are in the Letter of Offer are actually higher than what was shown yesterday in the rates circulated by the Minister, and he clarified that these are the new rates.
So, it is possible that the MAs have reduced their rates since then but the information that we had in 2012, the rates were at a higher level than what was circulated in the table yesterday.
The discussion was very detailed, the analysis of the MA rates. We looked at some factors such as: first of all, they were providing more staff than the previous MA; secondly, they are a company set up just to service us and we require them to operate quite a number of offices because of the boundaries of the town. Our town operated a total of five offices and one collection centre, so it is quite a lot of administrative costs. And, third of all, they are a company set up focusing on our work and, because of that, they may not have the same economies of scale as the larger companies that are running the other MAs. So, these were some of the factors that we took into account.
Additionally, there was also the consideration that there were many additional lifts coming on-stream, particularly in the Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC), which was experiencing Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) all at once, and the lift testing fees were to be paid by the MA. So, these are some of the factors. The discussions were very frank and also based on the expected cost structure. We benchmarked the salaries that they were paying their staff; we got an HR consultancy to come in to see that it is within the market benchmark. So, we did exercise some due diligence on that.
:
Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Can I just clarify with Ms Lim that last answer? She said that some monies were transferred back to the Sinking Fund before the AGO came in and, therefore, they must know what the rules are. They would have only transferred back because they knew what the rules are. So, the question is why did they not transfer everything back before the AGO came in?
:
Madam, as I mentioned earlier, we were doing the calculation as to what Sinking Fund expenses had been paid out of routine funds. So, it took us quite some time to net off the thing. And AGO advised us later on that this is a complicated way of doing things. So, it took us some time to do that. But, as I mentioned earlier, we do agree that the transfers were late and it should not have been done late.
: Mdm Speaker, on the Sinking Fund issue, Ms Lim has basically said that your Managing Agent did not do a good job of it. But you had told this House in May 2013 that they were hired on the basis of their professional skills and experience. So, how did that happen?
And on the rates that you quoted, and about all the due diligence that you have done, we are aware that FMSS is an exempt company, so the simple question is: did they make money, and did the Town Council lose money as a result? So, never mind all the details about computations, but the heart of the matter is: did they make money? If so, are you prepared to say how much? And how much money did the Town Council lose, meaning how much money did the residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East overpay?
: Thank you, Madam. Madam, these rates were through an open tender and awarded. That is the rate that they tendered for and we awarded the contract. Do you award a contract based on a certain rate agreed and subsequently you say they overcharged and you want the money back – I do not understand the logic.
Madam, would the Minister agree that it would make all these confusion clearer and easier if the public tender for Managing Agent contract, there are more than one tenderer? That would be easier. Then, we will have to answer today in Parliament, "Why are you not awarding the contract to the lowest tenderer?" I think it would be much, much easier and not to confuse as to why you give it to your friend and all that.
But the fact is, unfortunately, the environment is such that there is no one tendering for the Managing Agent job. Nobody wants to work for me, that is, a problem, Prime Minister. That is the environment we are in now.
: But Mr Low, I think we must remember one very critical detail, which is that the owner of FMSS – the GM, the Secretary, and the Deputy-GM – set up a company seven days after the General Election with a paid-up capital of $500,000. First of all, there is a very clear conflict of interest between what your Managing Agent, as owners, would do and what they as officers of the Town Council would do. You would surely agree that the incentives are very different when they are owners versus when they are just employees.
Second, for many, many years, Ms How and her team had been working with you in Hougang Town Council. You could have hired them as employees to do the work. In fact, as far as the cleaning, maintenance, services and all that, all the Town Councils outsource this work, so, plenty of big contractors all over Singapore who will be willing to do cleaning work, maintenance work, lift services work. And at the point when you terminated the CPG contract, it was pointed out in this House yesterday that the option rested with you. You could have extended it for another two years.
So, the issue that the elected Members of the AHPETC need to explain is why did you not extend the contract, and why was a company set up as an exempt private company seven days after the election, and in fact, before you initiated discussion with CPG? In other words, the termination and the intention to set this up was, as Minister Shanmugam pointed out yesterday, pre-meditated. And did the company make money? I think I have asked this question many times but you have not answered.
: I am not privy to the company's accounts; that is a private account, so I do not know. [
Interruptions
] Whether or not I will do that, I---
: It is Singaporeans' money. How much money did your friends make?
: Can I advise Members to address the Chair when you are responding or making your clarifications, and not to each other.
: To be fair, I think this is something which I have to respect; that is individual company. Let us come back to the other question. Ms Lim has explained yesterday the circumstances under which CPG, I mean, we signed a deal with CPG to agree for the termination. They were not prepared to work for us.
Whatever it is, you can question about why company was set up, but the fact is that they were only given the transitional contract for one year, and there were two tenders subsequently called. So, there was no guarantee. If let us say, for instance, that I want to set up a company, go and find $1 million or $500,000 in capitalisation to do a specific job, there is no certainty that I will be able to continue to do the job. So, is there an incentive for them to do this, if there is intention for greed and money? There is no guarantee, because you have to go through a public tender. That is why I said it would be easier if the public tender had more than one tenderer. And the other tenderer shows lower rate. And if we are not awarding to them, then I would have to answer here.
: Mdm Speaker, I think the hon Member has not answered the very straightforward question which I have posed, which is, yesterday we saw the big differences in the MA rates. As elected Members of Parliament running the Town Council, is it not in your instinct to say: "How did this happen?", "Are our residents getting a good deal?", "Why is this so?", "How much money are they making?"
Yes, it may be a single bid but is it not your responsibility to look at what happened? So, would you ask FMSS and FMSI how much profits have they made out of this contract over the last four years? Minister Shanmugam had said that the estimate is that the Town Council had paid at least $1.6 million more than you should every year for the last four years. So, if you are serving your residents well, should you not jump at that figure and say "I must do something about this. I must get to the bottom of this"? Rather than to say "Well, this was an open contract, there was only one bid and that was that."
And also, you did not answer my question which is, there were options. You said that they were experienced, they were professionals. Why did you not just simply hire them as employees and continue to run? You would know the cost with great clarity. You would know how much – because Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned about benchmarking. So, you would know exactly how much that you can pay Ms How and her team fairly, competitively and you would have avoided all these problems.
But you have not explained why such a convoluted structure, and what you have done to prevent the conflict of interests. You are not prepared to ask how much FMSS have made. You are not prepared to look into how much has the Town Council overpaid, and is this money lost through the front door?
: Madam, I will reiterate again. The Town Council paid the Managing Agent based on the contract sum agreed upon via a public tender. Why we did not decide to manage ourselves because it was a very much larger GRC. And at that point in time, in the Hougang SMC, there were about 20-odd staff and we know we need about a hundred staff to manage. At that point in time, we were very concerned about taking over a much larger GRC. If you manage it yourself, you will probably have a lot of other things that you have to look into.
So, we thought it would be better that if the Town Council, the old Town Council's staff, I mean, they have the experience, and are prepared to work with this company and are prepared to form a company or to manage the Town Council. They are prepared to do that.
:
Mdm Speaker, may I ask the hon Member whether is it perfectly all right to overpay your Managing Agent? Is that your conclusion?
:
Madam, what is there to decide on whether they are overpaid? This is a public tender, they tendered at that rate. We have done due diligence to check around about the rate.
: I think, Mdm Speaker, I find this discussion puzzling because, in fact, Ms Sylvia Lim had just, a few moments ago, told us that in terms of payment of staff, you had done a benchmarking. I assume that you did that to ensure that you do not overpay. Now that you have seen all the figures, it is a very clear instance that you have overpaid and the simple question is: "What are you going to do about it?"
May I suggest, Mdm Speaker, that we do not prolong this – where you just assert that in form there was a tender and this was the outcome and all that. As I said in my speech repeatedly, it is not about form, it is not about technical rules. It is about integrity, it is about trust, it is about how we whole-heartedly do our very best to serve the people who have elected us, to serve Singaporeans who have elected us. We should not just go behind the facade saying that the technical rules have all been obeyed, this was the outcome, and accept that. Now, having seen the numbers, I think the public can conclude what ought to be done.
: Minister Khaw Boon Wan.
: Mdm Speaker, over the last two days, we heard several, serious speeches on a serious topic. After all, this is the first time in our history that the Auditor-General had to conduct a special audit on a Town Council (TC). Findings of incompetence and inadequacies in corporate governance were uncovered. The sorry state of affairs in the AHPETC's financial administration and its systemic nature bear grave implications, not only for the residents but also for the sustainability and viability of the Town Council governance framework as we know it today.
Institutions that collect and spend public money must always ensure a high standard of transparency and accountability. Institutions are not perfect and there is always scope to improve. Occasionally, they may even make mistakes. Where there is criminal intent, the law will take its course. When mistakes are made, we expect the leaders in charge to take ownership and admit them and to promptly institute changes to avoid any repeat.
I thank Minister of State Sam Tan and Mr Liang Eng Hwa for reminding the House of the honour and privilege of being elected Members of Parliament, and of our duties and responsibilities as Town Councillors. As Members of Parliament, we set the tone and the standard of corporate governance in our respective Town Councils. As the Chinese saying goes: “上梁不正下梁歪”.If the top beam is not straight, the lower beams are bound to be crooked. If the leader sets a bad example, or condones bad behaviour by his senior staff, the other subordinates will likely follow suit.
Mr Hri Kumar voiced his grave concerns over the poor state of affairs in AHPETC. He shared his years of experience dealing with wrongdoings in the commercial world, and related them to the current saga. He highlighted the potential risks of abuses that the Town Council was in, if its weaknesses are left unrectified. He and others wondered how the Members of Parliament there could have allowed such lapses to happen, and to persist for so long.
Indeed, it is sad reading the Auditor-General's report, especially the appendices where the AHPETC was asked to respond. Not only are the AGO's findings troubling, but the defensiveness of the AHPETC in response to these findings suggests that instead of just taking ownership and to resolve to rectify the problems uncovered, the AHPETC is constantly looking for excuses to mitigate and rationalise the lapses.
But it is sadder listening to their speeches yesterday and today. I was initially cheered by Mr Low Thia Khiang's declaration that Workers' Party would support the motion. I thought finally they have acknowledged the mess they are in and their residents can now look forward to be eventually out of the hole. But my optimism was short-lived.
He went straight into a political speech, playing the victim of an unfair political world created by the Government, and calling for the depoliticisation of the transition process. And soon after, Ms Sylvia Lim and their other Members of Parliament spoke, repeating their objections to the AGO findings, objections which were already rebutted explicitly by AGO and documented in the AGO report. They were recycled in this House in the hope, I presume, that not many people would have read the appendices where such exchanges were recorded. This consistent pattern of evasive behaviour gives us cause to doubt the sincerity of the AHPETC Members of Parliament when they come to this House to declare their support for the motion and assure that they will make necessary changes.
Madam, I am a forgiving man and I listened very carefully to their speeches, hoping to find some trace of sincerity and genuine remorse. Sadly, I found none. Instead there was a certain arrogance, a disdain for having to come and address this House to answer for the adverse findings of the AGO audit. Yesterday, Mr Pritam Singh's refusal to reply to our Law Minister Shanmugam's questions was classic: "Well, Minister, if you were a resident, I will answer your question"! If there is no remorse, there can be no genuine acceptance that one is at fault and that one is morally if not duty-bound to make things right.
It reminded me of my days running hospitals. Often, I got to meet some diabetic patients at risk of further complications leading to blindness, organ failure. Some of them were able to avoid the complications by taking charge of their illness, changed their lifestyle, ate healthily, more brown rice, exercise regularly. But, unfortunately, for some, even as they assured their doctors of compliance – "Yes, I will do this; I will improve" – actually lived in denial, only to see their health continually deteriorate. And because I stayed in Ministry of Health for many years, I got to see those patients eventually and predictably ending up with chronic kidney failure, dialysis patients. Very sad. It could have been avoided. They only realised it when the organ failed but it is too late.
Madam,	I would urge that the AHPETC come out of denial and see the gravity of the situation for what it is. The AGO findings are not trivial. The lapses are symptomatic of a systemic failure: the failure to have proper controls and a reliable record and accounting system. This is the staple that every Town Council must have in order to operate. How else can you safeguard public monies? Indeed, the AGO's conclusions are that until those weaknesses are addressed, AHPETC cannot safeguard public monies; its accounts are inaccurate and unreliable.
In 1989, when we created the Town Councils, then-Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong explained in this House that the strategic intent was to empower elected Members of Parliament to be responsible for and be a part of governance of Singapore. It is to allow the Members of Parliament to demonstrate to the residents their ability to govern. All political parties, we assume, must aspire to eventually run the Singapore Government. Now, if they cannot even run a Town Council well, how can they be entrusted with the even more critical responsibility of running the whole country?
By vesting the Town Councils with powers to manage the HDB estates, the Government hands over significant authority to the Members of Parliament: powers to set and enforce by-laws; powers to collect Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC), and authority to procure and deliver programmes and services for their residents. A dysfunctional Town Council can have grave consequences for the residents.
In the past 25 years, there have been Town Councils run by PAP, as well as by Opposition Members of Parliament. While there were occasional hiccups, the Town Council framework has generally served us well. This is because there was a common understanding that each Member of Parliament would assume his duty of running a town council seriously. There was also a common understanding of the role of Town Councils that while they exercise autonomy, they are not sovereign bodies above the law. They must work in keeping with national policies, national interests and the law. They are certainly not a local warlord, above the law and accountable to only themselves.
The AGO audit findings confirmed the sad state of the situation at AHPETC. At the core of this tragic saga is the incompetence of its Managing Agent, the FMSS. Its incompetence spawned the many symptomatic lapses that the Auditor-General had observed in the Town Council.
The FMSS, as we heard yesterday, is very highly paid. And what a sterling service the FMSS has rendered the Town Council! It cannot even deliver a competent reliable system and administration of accounts and records. Without a reliable accounting and financial management system, there will be financial and accounting lapses, and opportunities for fraud, abuse and wrong-doing. And in such a setting, when wrong-doers dip their fingers into the pie, the acts may not be discovered for a long time. If I may quote another Chinese saying: “混水摸鱼”, that is, "When the water is murky, it is easier to fish." In other words, opacity creates opportunities for crooks to make money. Eventually, the financial health of the Town Council will be placed at risk. This can only be at the expense of the residents.
That is why we require all organisations to prepare fully audited financial accounts, unqualified. Unfortunately, we all know now, the Town Council had not been able to do so for several years. I think Mr Liang Eng Hwa put it quite succinctly – FMSS has severely short-changed the Town Council. The residents there pay more, and get less!
Minister Shanmugam probed further and asked about the financial position of FMSS, and whether FMSS would publish its accounts. Mr Heng did the same thing just now. And, as we heard, there was no reply. But I bet that the FMSS is one of those rare companies which are profitable from year one. And if my guess is correct, we can safely assume where the husband-and-wife team places their priority. To preserve the peace with the residents, they work on the visible aspects of Town Council work: cleaning the floors, maintaining the lifts. And in any case, such work is not done by them. It is outsourced to external contractors and, in fact, the FMSS is paid to oversee them. As for the invisible aspects of Town Council work that residents do not get to see, like corporate governance, accounting procedures, timely payment into the Sinking Fund, and reducing operating deficits, they probably figure that such things being out of sight can wait. But this is also at the expense of the residents, though the effects may not be obvious immediately. It is only as a result of their own auditor's disclaimers, and now the deeper findings of the AGO audit, that we have sight of the mess that they have been hiding from all of us.
Minister Shanmugam gave us a vivid analysis of the intrinsically troubling structure of FMSS and its relationship with AHPE Town Council. He is our Law Minister. He said in this House that the structure is downright unlawful, and that it is a serious breach of fiduciary duties for any Town Councillor to have approved such a process. Inflated fees were paid to the FMSS, in return for gross incompetence, placing the Town Council's financial health at risk. The excess fees paid to FMSS, we have heard, were estimated at $1.6 million per year. So, in four years, it is $6.4 million; $1.6 million per year, $6.4 million for four years. In three short years, the Town Council's finances deteriorated from a $3.3 million surplus to a deficit of almost $¾ million. In short, FMSS and its owners who
de facto
run the Town Council have milked it, and residents' money and public funds have, in this manner, been abused. That was the conclusion and the statement by Minister Shanmugam. So, in this House yesterday, he asked the elected MPs whether they were aware of this governance structure and process. No answers! Whether collectively or individually. Instead, we were inundated with speeches over several hours on minutiae details, details which are already recorded in the appendices of the auditors' report. Minutiae details which they have also offered to the Auditor-General, and many of which had been rejected by them. But they recycled it here and conveniently kept silent on the key questions put up by the Minister for Law.
Workers' Party (WP) MPs had made light of the AGO findings when they asserted yesterday that AGO had found no evidence of loss of money or fraudulent activity. But as we have now heard, this is a misrepresentation of AGO's conclusions. Mr Hri Kumar highlighted this point. AGO pointed this out in Appendix A of its report when the WP tried to put such words in AGO's mouth. AGO did not draw such a conclusion, that there was no loss of money or fraudulent activity. In fact, with so many documents missing, and the accounts unreliable, who can be sure that there was no wrongdoing?
Instead of making such an assertion, attributing a conclusion to the AGO audit which, in fact, the AGO had categorically rejected, Mr Low or Ms Sylvia Lim should just roll up their sleeves and do real work: mount a serious forensic investigation, as suggested by Mr Hri Kumar, into the records and pursue all the findings of the AGO report, clean up the accounts, correct the flawed structure, institute a robust system, discipline any errant officers, get the MA to return the money, explain to their residents. They have a lot of work to do.
While the incompetence of FMSS, the Managing Agent, caused all these problems, it was in the end only the proximate cause. The primary cause was, unfortunately, the dereliction of duty by the Town Councillors, condoning this, allowing it to happen, and then making excuses for it when uncovered, instead of putting things right. Only they, the Town Councillors, can unwind the mess. If I may borrow another Chinese saying: “解铃还需系铃人”, that is, "Only he who attached the bell can remove it."
The systemic failure at AHPETC resides in the arrangement that they have allowed – the
de facto
management of AHPETC being also the owners of the Managing Agent, resulting in the adverse outcome of over-charging and the obvious ineffectiveness of any oversight by the Town Councillors. The result is the deteriorating financial health of the Town Council, with all signs suggesting it is only going to get worse this year and the next. If a listed company had such an auditor's report, the Chairman of the company would be duty-bound to investigate and to satisfy himself and his shareholders whether fraud or criminal conduct was involved. In this instance, the ball is in the Workers' Party's court.
Regardless, we must not allow the FMSS to profiteer from their incompetence. All the more when it is at the expense of residents and public monies. Even if it was not illegal, it is morally wrong. Mr Low should not condone this. He should hold his Managing Agent accountable. I expect him to take action against the FMSS for their monumental incompetence. That would be the right thing to do. Mr Hri Kumar was helpful and described a road map forward for them to follow.
Meanwhile, I welcome Mr Low's support of the Motion. But he must walk the talk, if I may borrow the Minister for Law, Mr Shanmugam's words, as he put it yesterday. It cannot be just lip service, a convenient way of sliding past this debacle, to live and fight another day. Demonstrate your sincerity through real actions. There is another Chinese saying for this: “听其言，观其行”, that is, "Watch his actions, even as you are listening to his words."
How to show sincerity?
(a) Take concrete steps to recover the losses that they have allowed to take place. Make restitution to the residents for the losses to their Town Council.
(b) Submit a clean set of accounts for FY2013 to Parliament by 30 June this year. Submit your accounts for FY2014 on time, like all the other Town Councils, by 31 August this year. Account to Parliament, account to your residents, here, in this House.
And these are not high hurdles. These are the basic requirements for any organisation, for anyone seeking to run for office in any organisation. Every Town Council has been able to do this, including those run by Opposition MPs in the past. This is what supporting the Motion means.
Mr Liang Eng Hwa said that he would call for a Division when the vote on the motion is taken. I support his call. This is a matter on which it is important for each one of us to take a stand explicitly.
Mdm Speaker, this has been a very painful debate. But if our discussions have given us pause to reflect on our responsibilities as Members of Parliament and as Town Councillors and strengthen our resolve and determination to do better, regardless which party we belong to, then something good may yet come out of all this.
Let us support the motion. This motion is not about PAP versus WP. This motion is about Singaporeans. This motion is about our residents.
Let us do our very best to uphold high standards of governance, transparency and accountability so that we can protect their interests. Let us do our best to protect and safeguard all the public monies that have been entrusted to our Town Councils. Madam, I beg to move.
: Ms Sylvia Lim.
:
Thank you, Madam. I just like to clarify with the Minister what he mentioned about requiring the Town Council to submit unqualified or clean accounts for the next two years by a certain deadline. As the Minister would have noted in the AGO report, there was a couple of disclaimers that were highlighted. Some of them had been cleared. Some of them we will put in efforts to clear them, but there may be a few which will remain, such as operating balances and so on. So, I just hope that we can work with MND to come up with something satisfactory for MND to accept.
: Madam, I am a reasonable man. I am also a generous man. I am also a very religious man. So, where possible, I try to help, whoever. It does not matter whether you are PAP or non-PAP. The key point is: are you sincere in wanting to help your residents? If you are honest, if you are clean, I will do my best to help you.
: Mr Liang, you wish to say something?
: Madam, I call for a Division.
: Instead of claiming a Division, would you prefer to have your vote be recorded instead?
: Madam, I call for a Division, please.
: Will hon Members who support the Division please rise in their places?
: Okay, Members, you can sit down; looks like everybody has stood up. Clerk, ring the Division bells.
: Serjeant-at-Arms, please lock the doors. The Question is, "The motion standing in the name of the Minister for National Development." Mr Liang, you have claimed a Division, would you like to proceed?
:
I call for a Division.
: Take a Division. Before I proceed to start the electronic voting, Members are advised to read the instructions for voting, which are found in the left compartment of their seats, where their earpieces are placed. Do not forget to press the button that you are "Present". Otherwise, your vote will not be reflected. You may now begin to vote.
Members are advised to check that their names are registered on the display board according to your vote indication.
There are a few Members who have not pressed their "Present" button. The Clerk will now proceed to call your names so that you can indicate your vote.
: Yes.
:
Are Nominated Members allowed to vote?
:
Yes. You are allowed to vote. Can you please indicate your vote so that we can record it manually?
: Yes.
:
Yes, Madam. I had already voted "yes".
:
There are 85 "Ayes", nil "Noes", nil "Abstention".
The "Ayes" have it.
asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the average monthly annuity payment, by decile, that will be drawn by CPF LIFE members once they reach the draw down age in 2015; and (b) what is the average monthly annuity payment forecast for the next three years based on extrapolating current trends.
: CPF members turning age 55 from 2013, with at least $40,000 in their Retirement Account (RA) at age 55 or $60,000 in their RA at age 65 will be automatically included into CPF LIFE. Mainstream members in the first cohort to be automatically included will only commence their monthly payouts from CPF LIFE from 2023. CPF members who are currently receiving a monthly payout from CPF LIFE have chosen to opt in.
For the cohort of CPF members who reached their Draw Down Age of 63 in 2014 and are eligible to draw down on their savings, 15% have opted into CPF LIFE. The median monthly CPF LIFE payout among them was $394. It is not meaningful to extrapolate future CPF LIFE payouts for successive cohorts because the distribution of payouts is dependent on the average balances of members who have chosen to opt in. However, CPF balances have been improving over time, and CPF LIFE payouts for successive cohorts will also increase correspondingly.
