asked
the Minister for Trade and Industry what implications will a depressed oil price over a prolonged period have on our petrochemical sector and on Singapore's economy in general.
3
asked
the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what impact will falling oil prices have on our economy; and (b) whether current adjusted prices on public utilities and at petrol pumps fairly reflect the fall in oil prices.
:
Mdm Speaker, can I have your permission to take Question Nos 1 to 3 together?
:
Yes, please.
: Thank you. Global oil prices have fallen sharply in recent months on the back of sluggish global demand and strong supply conditions. Since June 2014, the benchmark Brent oil price has declined from a peak of US$115 per barrel to around US$50 per barrel recently.
Ms Foo asked about the impact of the decline in oil prices on Singapore's economy, businesses and consumers. As a net importer of oil, the Singapore economy will benefit from lower oil prices. In particular, a drop in oil prices will translate to lower electricity tariffs and fuel costs, which will directly benefit businesses and consumers.
For businesses, lower electricity tariffs and fuel costs will help to lower their input costs. This will help improve their margins, and could also dampen the pass-through of business costs to consumer prices. Consumers, on their part, will benefit from lower spending on electricity and other oil-related items such as petrol. Lower inflation in the economy could also increase their purchasing power, thereby stimulating consumption and further boosting the economy.
Mr Yeo asked about the impact of lower oil prices on the petrochemical sector. Overall, the sector will benefit from lower oil prices due to reduced input costs for oil-based feedstock and utilities. However, the upside of lower input costs may be limited, as prices of key petrochemical products have also fallen in tandem with oil prices.
Mr Ong asked about the current adjusted prices of public utilities and pump prices, and whether they fairly reflect the fall in oil prices. EMA regulates the electricity tariff to ensure that the quarterly tariff revisions fairly reflect the underlying costs of production, including fuel costs. As the price of natural gas, which is the main fuel used for electricity generation in Singapore, has fallen in tandem with oil prices, the electricity tariff has likewise been adjusted downwards. For example, between July 2014 and January 2015, average gas prices fell by 19%. As fuel costs make up around half the tariff, the electricity tariff between July 2014 and March 2015 accordingly fell by 9.3%.
Pump prices fell by 15% between July and December 2014, compared to a 41% fall in crude oil prices over the same period. The fuel component of pump prices is not determined by the price of crude oil, but the price of refined products like petrol and diesel. In addition, petrol companies also have to take into account non-fuel costs such as land and labour costs when setting their prices. These are some reasons why pump prices fell by a smaller percentage compared to the drop in crude oil prices.
:
Ms Foo Mee Har.
: Madam, I thank the Minister for his response. I would like to ask the Minister a few supplementary questions. The Minister has highlighted the flow-through benefits of low oil prices. I would also like to highlight that the Malaysian ringgit is also at its historic lows; and Malaysia is a country where we import a significant amount of produce. I would like to ask the Minister if he has any prediction on the downward revision of the 2015 core inflation rate, or even a possibility of deflation.
Also, so far, despite the fall in oil prices – and the Minister has shared some numbers – but I think consumers on the ground have really not seen the pass-through reduction in prices. Could the Minister explain what Government measures are in place to ensure that there is no profiteering and ensure that some cost savings are passed to the consumers, especially in terms of transport and food prices?
The last question is about people working in the oil and gas sector. Given the intense pressure on companies' bottomline, I am concerned that the job security of Singaporeans working in this sector may be bleak, if companies decide to cut staff costs to manage their bottomline. Any policy measures in place to mitigate this impact should this situation occur? Thank you.
: Mdm Speaker, as I had mentioned in my earlier reply, overall, there will be a slight positive impact on the economy because of the lower oil prices – because of the cost of the businesses as well as to the consumers. In terms of inflation, it will have a small benign effect; it will lower inflation. As we have indicated in our economic forecast, we expect the headline inflation to come down this year, lower compared to last year. But the core inflation will remain rather sticky because we still have a lot of economic restructuring. The high wage cost is likely to pass through to the core inflation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is watching the situation very carefully. We expect the core inflation to remain still quite stiff, but the headline inflation will be adjusted downwards.
On the oil and gas sector, as I had mentioned just now, there is a slight positive effect because of feedstock prices. But the petro-chemical and chemical prices have also come down. So, the margins remain very small and tight. The main reason is because there is over capacity in the Asian region, and therefore, competition remains very stiff. In that sense, I do not think the impact on the oil sector will be too significant. The feedback we get from the oil and gas sector – if we look at the petro-chemical cluster – they benefit from the feedstock, but they are also affected by the revenue. So, I think they will be quite neutral. For the oil and marine sector -- those involved in the oil rigs -- the impact will be more in the longer term. For the immediate future, their order books are still very strong and I think that will keep them in good stead for the next few years. But if the oil prices remain low for a prolonged period, then, this will affect their long-term prospects. So, for those in the oil and gas sector -- which I presume the Member means the oil and marine sector, and those in the oil rig construction – the prospects are okay for the immediate future, and will only be adversely affected if the oil prices remain low for a long time.
:
While the low oil prices spell good news for the Singapore economy in general. Could I ask the Minister will the low oil prices slow down our drive towards cleaner and renewable energy?
:
I think our attitude towards energy conservation and alternative energy is a long-term one. This is because we are an energy-disadvantaged country, and we have to diversify our energy sources. We are anticipating a global agreement on climate change and we would have to meet these obligations. These are the long-term trends. Our strategy is to meet these long-term requirements, rather than be influenced by short-term volatility in the oil prices.
:
Ms Foo, keep it short, please.
:
Madam, I would like to ask the Minister to give his thoughts regarding the question I raised in the supplementary question earlier about prevention of profiteering, because many consumers on the streets are not seeing the significant oil price reduction translating into food prices and transport prices. These are the concerns on the ground. I hope the Minister could enlighten us on whether there are measures to stop companies from profiteering.
: Our main approach is to ensure that competition forces are at play. This is regulated and supervised by the Competition Commission of Singapore. In sectors where they are regulated, then, of course, we have to make sure that the regulation is transparent and the factors are clearly seen by everybody. For example, in the utilities sector, this is a regulated sector, and EMA regulates this on a very transparent formula, taking into account fuel prices as well as other costs. As I had explained in my reply, this has translated into a significant drop in the utilities prices.
For the other sectors, for example, pump prices, we have to depend on competition and market forces to make sure there is no profiteering.
asked
the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the impact of the recent falling Eurodollar, oil prices and rising US dollar on Singapore's competitiveness and economy.
: Mdm Speaker, the recent rise in the US dollar and fall in the Euro reflect the diverging prospects of the US and Eurozone economies. While the US economy has been improving steadily, the pace of recovery in the Eurozone remains weak.
In line with global movements in the US dollar and the Euro, the Singapore dollar has depreciated against the US dollar in recent months, and appreciated against the Euro. However, such movements in bilateral currency pairs are not expected to have a significant impact on Singapore's economy. Under Singapore's exchange rate-centred monetary policy framework, the MAS manages the Singapore dollar exchange rate against a trade-weighted basket of currencies within a prescribed policy band, and does not focus on any specific bilateral currency pair. This framework allows the Singapore dollar to be managed against short-term market fluctuations, while limiting the spill-overs that exchange rate volatility may have on the real economy.
It is also important to note that the exchange rate is not used as a tool to directly manage Singapore's export competitiveness in the short term. Instead, demand conditions in our major export markets would have a more significant impact on Singapore's growth prospects. We expect the strengthening of the US economy, which underpins the appreciation of the US dollar, to be a positive factor for the Singapore economy.
As for the impact of falling oil prices, I have explained the impact on Singapore's economy in my reply earlier. While lower input costs for our exporters due to falling oil prices may also help to enhance the price competitiveness of our exports, the impact is likely to be limited as other exporters will also benefit from lower oil prices. Moreover, it is important to note that any competitive advantage derived from lower oil prices will only be temporary in nature. To enhance our competitiveness over the longer term, it is more important for us to press on with on-going efforts to help our firms improve productivity and build up their innovative capacity.
asked
the Minister for Defence (a) how many troops are currently deployed to support the coalition against ISIS; (b) what has been their involvement so far; and (c) whether the Ministry expects there to be requests for greater support from Singapore in the near to medium term.
: Mdm Speaker, as informed to this House in November last year, the SAF will support the multinational coalition against the extremist threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.
I stated then in November the reasons for Singapore's strong stand against extremist terrorism. If I can quote, "Singapore must resolutely oppose the spread of terrorism in order to safeguard our security here. It is in Singapore's interest to support the multinational efforts against ISIS and its attempts to export terrorism to our region, whether by sending foreign terrorists to carry out terrorist operations or by radicalising regional elements who engage in violence in Iraq, Syria and subsequently their home countries. If this terrorism threat is allowed to grow and spread, innocent civilians here and elsewhere could be endangered and killed." This was in November.
Unfortunately, Members would know that in the intervening months, events in other countries have confirmed in stark terms that regardless of geographical distances, the threat of extremists, if not addressed, can result in terrorist attacks on residents in home countries.
What radical elements like ISIS are perpetrating have nothing to do with Islam, which teaches love, compassion and amity. Unfortunately, the false extremist ideology of these groups has attracted fighters from foreign lands and radicalised individuals to carry out atrocious acts in their home countries against innocent civilians of all races and religions, including Muslims. An estimated 1,000 foreign fighters are joining ISIS each month. While airstrikes have degraded ISIS' oil-refining capacity and resulted in a fall in its oil revenue, ISIS reportedly continues to fund its operations from ransom money and human trafficking.
More countries have joined the coalition against ISIS because they recognise that unless the source of this radicalisation is disrupted, their citizens at home cannot be protected. During the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, you will remember that bombs exploded in Bali and Jakarta. If this can happen in Indonesia, a Muslim-majority country, it can happen anywhere. All countries and their citizens are at risk from extremist terrorists. Our neighbours understand this threat and this is why Malaysia has also increased its vigilance.
More than 40 nations in the coalition are contributing military capabilities to operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. These countries include Morocco, Jordan and Qatar, nearby countries that are at higher risk of reprisals from ISIS. But these neighbouring countries all recognise that a greater threat will exist if ISIS grows.
The combined efforts of many countries are having an impact in the fight against ISIS. To date, a number of key ISIS leaders have been killed. Iraqi security forces and Kurdish forces have also regained about 700 square km of ISIS-captured territory and halted ISIS' attempts to seize new territory. ISIS is now largely in a defensive fight to hold on to its territory and to protect its lines of communication and resupply. In Iraq, the key coalition gains have been in the positions around Baghdad, which have blocked ISIS' movement southwards, parts near Fallujah, as well as the Mosul Dam. In December, Kurdish forces launched an offensive to retake Mount Sinjar, which is strategically located as it links Mosul, the main ISIS stronghold in Iraq, and ISIS territory in Syria. In Syria, Kurdish forces are in control of the majority of Kobani, a strategic town as it lies just south of the border with Turkey.
Let me now report on the progress of the SAF's efforts, which the Member has asked. Following the announcement in November last year, the SAF sent a Needs Assessment and Survey Team to the United States Central Command Headquarters. A liaison officer has also been attached there since December last year, to facilitate planning and coordination for the SAF.
Over the next few months, the SAF will further deploy planners to the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) Headquarters and the Combined Air Operations Centre. We will also be sending a Pre-Deployment Site Survey team to prepare for our subsequent deployment of the KC-135 tanker as co-ordinated with the Task Force Headquarters.
At this early stage of our involvement, it is premature to determine if there will be further requests for greater support from Singapore to the coalition. Thank you, Madam.
: Madam, I thank the Minister for his response. It is important that the SAF and Singapore have committed ourselves to this important effort to target and combat ISIS.
As the Minister has mentioned in his preamble, recent tragedies in different countries including, most recently, in Paris and Belgium, some of which have been linked to these countries' participation in the fight against ISIS. With regard to this, does the Ministry detect any heightened risk to Singapore since our early deployment, and what are some of the efforts to prevent this from occurring in Singapore?
: Madam, it is an important question but the appropriate agency and the Ministry to do internal assessment for our security would be MHA, and I would request the Member ask the Deputy Prime Minister. But I have this to say, as we said to the religious leaders which Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Ministers and myself, and the Foreign Minister met before these attacks, that, firstly, you cannot guarantee Singaporeans that such attacks would not occur in any country, and all of us know that. And the incidents in general have gone up, particularly because you had small groups, even lone wolfs, acting independently, being influenced by what they read, the false ideology they are exposed to. It is well-nigh impossible for any security force in any country to be able to monitor every citizen.
Our greatest challenge indeed is that if an attack occurs, what happens to the unity which we have forged over many years, now 50 years of our independence? Will it fracture, will there be suspicion? Will there be reprisals? And this is what we must be focused on.
I think we have done a lot to build unity, whether that unity can withstand such attacks if they occur, we must not let it, and we must continue to use this time not only to increase our vigilance and to ask our citizens, each citizen, to also be vigilant, our security forces to be vigilant, but also to ask community to come together and withstand such false ideology and stand together, if ever such an attack occurs.
asked
the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he can provide an update on the results of the Environmental Impact Assessment conducted by Malaysia in respect of the land reclamation project in the Straits of Johor.
(for the Minister for Foreign Affairs) :
Mdm Speaker, I believe the hon Member is referring to the Forest City reclamation project by Country Garden Pacificview Sdn Bhd and the R&F Princess Cove reclamation project by R&F Development Sdn Bhd in the Straits of Johor. Singapore remains committed to working with Malaysia to address our concerns over Malaysia's reclamation projects in the Straits of Johor that could have potential transboundary impact on Singapore.
As you are aware, we had on several occasions conveyed to Malaysia our concerns and requests for more information, including the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports, on these reclamation projects. Singapore also recently held consultations with Malaysia on this matter at the 28th meeting of the Malaysia-Singapore Joint Committee on the Environment (MSJCE) and 27th Malaysia-Singapore Annual Exchange of Visits (MSAEV) held in Malaysia from 24 to 25 November 2014.
Malaysia had responded with some general information on the reclamation projects and promised to share all other information, including the EIA reports, once its internal processes are completed. At the consultations, we exchanged views with Malaysia and sought further clarifications on these works. We also reiterated to Malaysia that both countries are obliged under general international law and, in particular, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to undertake and share EIA reports on all works that could have transboundary impact, prior to the commencement of such works.
Singapore was informed that Malaysia's internal processes regarding the EIAs have yet to be completed. We were also informed that Malaysia had ordered these reclamation works in Johor to be suspended. Malaysian Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Dato' Sri Dr James Dawos Mamit subsequently said it would take at least three more months for the finalised EIA reports to be ready. His comments were reported in the
TODAY
newspaper on 29 November 2014.
More recently, it was reported in the media that the reclamation projects have been approved by the Malaysian Department of Environment. However, Singapore has yet to receive the Malaysian government's official response on this issue, including the finalised EIA reports. We are seeking clarification from Malaysia and have reiterated our requests for Malaysia to provide the finalised EIA reports and all relevant information expeditiously, prior to the commencement of such works.
: I thank the Minister for the reply but, apparently, the media from both sides of the Causeway has reported that Princess Cove's developer, Guangzhou R&F Properties have engaged a Malaysian-based environmental and hydraulic consultant Dr Nik & Associates to carry out a detailed environmental impact assessment, and it was reported that EIA had concluded that the reclamation will not be contributing too much negative impact to its environment.
I am not so sure if the Minister has clarified this report with the counterpart. In addition, it was also reported in the press that the outermost point of the reclaimed land of the Princess Cove project will only be 290 metres away from the Singapore border. Two hundred and ninety metres is a relatively short distance, less than six laps of an Olympics-sized swimming pool, so many average swimmers could easily swim that distance.
Hence, does such a close proximity between the Johor's reclaimed land and Singapore's borders pose a border security threat to Singapore?
:
Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary question, but I believe that I have answered the question in my reply that we have not received the report and we are working with our Malaysian counterparts to obtain the report as soon as we can, and we will study the report seriously.
:
Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Minister whether will the Singapore side be doing our own independent environment impact study, looking at the whole project? Thank you.
:
Yes, we will definitely be studying very carefully but there is information that is required of Malaysia, so we are working with our counterparts to get the necessary information before we can do a thorough study.
:
Mdm Speaker, as the Member of Parliament for Yew Tee division, we have quite a lot of biodiversity sitting within our division and this project would have a major impact on some of them. Therefore, my question to the Second Minister would be, if this project would go ahead unilaterally, is there anything that the Singapore Government can do to stop this project from proceeding without the conclusion of the EIA?
: As I had mentioned in my reply, we would always work very closely with our Malaysian counterpart; there are prescribed international law including UNCLOS that basically describe what countries should do when there are actions that have a transboundary effect on another. So these are and have always been our
modus operandi
, that we would like to work according to international legal framework.
But I think it is too premature to suggest our counterpart will do one way or another. I think at this point in time, we would just like to reiterate that we prefer to work closely with them, getting the report from them, getting the information from them, and sharing our studies with them as well. As I had mentioned earlier, there have been several meetings, and I think our counterpart has been forthcoming, they have agreed to give us the report, so let us just go according to the plan. Thank you.
:
Supplementary question, Madam. I would like to ask the Second Minister: what is the internationally accepted protocol for such a reclamation project, and whether there is any agreement between Singapore and Malaysia with regard to such reclamation of land? I recall that Malaysia made a lot of noise when we did our reclamation. So, what was the agreement or understanding that we have forged with them?
:
Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member very much for the supplementary questions. There is agreed protocol and I think both countries are committed to work according to this protocol. The Malaysians have agreed to let us have the EIA report. So, we are waiting for that report.
asked
the Minister for Transport with regard to the ongoing 2014 fare review exercise by the Public Transport Council (PTC), whether the PTC will consider a reduction of transport fares as a result of the fall in oil prices since June 2014.
: Mdm Speaker, the fare formula is pegged to changes in the Core Consumer Price Index, Wage Index and Energy Index over the preceding year, and reflects the operating cost structure of the public transport operators. So, the Core Consumer Price Index and the Wage Index will each account for 40% of the fare formula, while the Energy Index will account for 20%. For the ongoing fare review exercise which we began in November 2014, we are looking at changes in the indices in the year 2013. It is important to remember that while we started in November 2014, we used the data and indices in the year 2013.
Energy and fuel costs are reflected in the Energy Index component, as mentioned earlier, which accounts for 20% of the fare adjustment quantum. The value of this component for the on-going 2014 fare review exercise is negative 12.6%, due to lower energy prices in 2013.
However, the Core Consumer Price Index and Wage Index, which make up the remaining 80% of the fare adjustment quantum, had gone up in 2013, and they are plus 1.7% for the Core Consumer Price Index and plus 4.3% for the Wage Index.
Taking these changes in the indices into consideration, the fare adjustment quantum for the year 2014 yielded by the formula is negative 0.6%. So, for 2014, using the index indices in 2013, the formula yielded negative 0.6%.
Now, some of you may recall that in the last fare exercise, the fare adjustment quantum was 6.6%. However, it was assessed that 6.6% would be too much of an increase in one go, and the Public Transport Council therefore decided that it would implement only a 3.2% increase in the 2013 fare review exercise, and carry over the remaining 3.4% to the on-going 2014 fare exercise.
So, when we add this year's negative 0.6% to the carried-over 3.4%, we get the fare adjustment quantum of 2.8% for the on-going fare review exercise. If I put it another way, supposing we had implemented the full 6.6% fare adjustment quantum in the previous fare review exercise, and we did not carry over 3.4%, then, indeed, we would have a fare adjustment for this year that is negative, and it would be negative 0.6% this time round.
If I look ahead to the next fare exercise, and this is the fare exercise that we will conduct towards the end of this year, called the 2015 Fare Review Exercise, and this is using the data from the full year of 2014, the drop in 2014's energy prices could possibly translate to a negative fare adjustment. Based on available data, and we do not have the full year's data as yet, I would have to say that it could be in the region of negative 1%.
What I have just provided are the numbers according to the fare formula. We will have to leave it to the Public Transport Council to assess the public transport operators' applications for fare increase, the fare adjustment quantum as given by the formula, and the affordability of public transport for Singaporeans, amongst other things, and decide on the fare adjustment.
asked
the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry is considering adjusting the Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fee on foreign vehicles entering Singapore in view of Malaysia's imposition of a similar VEP fee for Singaporean vehicles entering Johor.
: Mdm Speaker, Singapore's Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fee seeks to equalise the cost of owning and using a foreign-registered vehicle in Singapore, with that for a Singapore-registered vehicle.
Malaysia's proposed vehicle entry levy, on the other hand, appears to be more akin to a toll on foreign-registered vehicles for revenue purposes. If so, we will consider matching in some form after the details of the levy are confirmed, including whether it is imposed only at Malaysia's border with Singapore or at all of its borders.
asked
the Minister for Health in respect of increased expenditure in the public healthcare sector over the last five years (a) what percentage has been spent on (i) direct clinical services and (ii) administrative overheads respectively; and (b) how does the Ministry ensure equity of resource allocation among the various institutions.
(for the Minister for Health) :
Mdm Speaker, the bulk of the expenditure in the public healthcare sector goes directly to medical and patient services. About 15%-20% of the public hospitals and institutions' expenditures are attributable to administrative functions, such as corporate services, human resource, finance, and IT. This is similar to other countries such as England, Canada and the Netherlands, and is lower than the United States which is reported to spend at least 25% of hospital costs on administration.
We are mindful of the need for our public healthcare institutions to keep administrative costs low and deliver healthcare services efficiently. This will help ensure that healthcare remains affordable and sustainable in the long term.
Ms Tin also asked about the allocation of resources among the institutions. The Ministry subvents the public healthcare institutions with block budgets. This is determined based on several factors, including workload, type of services provided, and the complexity of the medical conditions each institution has to manage. The block budget for each institution is reviewed regularly to take into account advancements in medical care, inflation, as well as the institution's workload and patient profile.
We will continue to refine the resource allocation to ensure that our public healthcare providers deliver services efficiently and achieve good health outcomes for Singaporeans.
:
Thank you, Madam, and I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. I hear from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply that one of the factors taken into account for the allocation is patient volume and workload. May I ask how will MOH ensure that the KPIs set in public hospitals will be in such a way that it would not drive unintended behaviours? For example, encouraging or perhaps pressuring patients to take on more procedures or more expensive procedures than necessary.
: Madam, I would like to thank Ms Tin for her supplementary question. When we look at the performance of institutions as well as the hospitals and doctors, we have a holistic performance indicator. We recognise them for the things that they do, including the productivity of the institution and of the doctors as well, including the kind of clinical services that they do as well as teaching, research and administrative duties that they carry out. So, at the holistic level, we want to ensure that our stakeholders do the best for the patients and for the medical area that they are looking at.
At the MOH level, we do costing exercise where we work very closely with the institutions to ensure that our legislative framework is robust and, at the same time, we are able to meet the needs of the patients. On the other hand, at the institution level, each institution has its own governance framework. Maybe some of them would look at setting up an accreditation committee, peer review and even before the operation is carried out, there are pre-operation conferences to ensure that we take the appropriate treatment measures that set the best outcome for our patients.
Beyond the KPIs and budgetary framework, what I would like to also share with Ms Tin and Members that being doctors, they are professionals. Different doctors would have different opinions. So, I would like to urge patients to also refer to their doctors so that they can have second or third opinion, so that among doctors they can talk to each other, discuss what would be the best treatment procedure for the patients so that they can provide the best outcome for them.
:
Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Supplementary question, please. With respect to the 15%-20% of the budget directed towards administrative cost: firstly, is there a rising trend or a falling trend, and would MOH have some form of target and, if so, what is being done to meet that target?
:
Essentially, if you look at the international benchmark, there is no set or widely accepted benchmark around the world. What we have looked at are some basic and common benchmarks, and the figures for each year vary for the different types of work. We feel that our current approach of 15%-20% is appropriate at this point in time. Nevertheless, as I had mentioned earlier, we will do our best to see how we can facilitate the process of working efficiently -- and I think at the heart of the matter is always to meet the needs of our patients -- because we want to take care of the patients and give them the best services and outcomes.
:
Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I echo the hon Member's concern in his question. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary as regards to, not about just the trend of spending this amount of money on the administration as well as the headcount for administration. From what we can observe, the headcount for the administrative non-medical personnel seems to be growing much faster compared to the medical personnel in the hospitals.
: Madam, I would like to thank the Member for the question. From his observation, he finds that the headcount has increased. With the services that we render to our people and with the ageing population, you would expect that there may be increases in the headcount. What is important is that while we try to reach out to our people in a manner that gives them the best option, we are also using technologies to see how we can facilitate treatment as well as the outcome for our patients.
So, we are mindful of the increases, if there are any, but like what I said earlier, there is no common track if you look at the different institutions that are available. What is key is how we can operate efficiently but not at the expense of our patients' needs.
asked
the Minister for Health in view of the acute shortage of doctors in certain specialities in our public hospitals and the opening of new public hospitals in the coming years, whether he will consider introducing a conditional specialist accreditation scheme that accredits foreign medical specialists to practice in Singapore, on the condition that they practice only in public hospitals and in specialties where we have an acute shortage.
(for the Minister for Health) :
Mdm Speaker, the Specialists Accreditation Board and the Singapore Medical Council already have such a scheme in place. Foreign medical specialists who are recruited by the public sector hospitals must first be accredited by the Specialists Accreditation Board before they are conditionally registered with the Singapore Medical Council.
Conditional registration requires such specialists to fulfil a supervision period in an approved institution. All the public hospitals are approved institutions to hire such specialists, and they can make use of this scheme to manage their medical manpower requirements. Majority of these specialists can be fully registered upon satisfactorily completing the conditions of their conditional registration. However, a small minority will have other restrictions or conditions imposed on their registration, and these will remain conditionally registered. This scheme is applicable to all specialties.
: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for the answer. Currently, we have a lot of new and large hospitals coming on stream and that requires manpower. There is also, at the same time, concurrently an outflow of doctors into the private sector. On the whole, we have a shortage of doctors in the public sector and I know of reputable doctors from overseas who have got a very public service ethos, who would be happy to work in Singapore. The problem is that even with their credibility and reputation, they have been denied accreditation in Singapore.
Therefore, I suggested this scheme whereby, unlike the current scheme, the doctors that are accredited to work in Singapore are limited only to the public sector, indefinitely. The current scheme I think allows the foreign doctors to go into the private sector after being supervised for two years in the public hospitals. Can the Minister of State elaborate on that?
: I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. I understand Dr Tan's concerns. There are certain specialties where the specialised training programmes are not standardised internationally, and the training quality as well as the duration of the training may vary between countries, thus making it very difficult to establish equivalence.
However, such applicants can practise as non-specialist doctors, for example, as staff physicians, and application for specialist accreditation can be re-assessed after a period of working in Singapore. For other substantive applications where a specialist training committee's support is strong, the specialist accreditation board can review the appeal on a case-by-case basis.
I would like to thank Dr Tan for the comments as well as the suggestions, and I would appreciate if Dr Tan can highlight any such cases worthy of consideration to the Ministry of Health, and we will be happy to look at them.
:
Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Minister of State: in the last few years, what percentage of the foreign doctors who are registered in Singapore, subsequently, when they get their full accreditation, leave for private practice straightaway? And what is the percentage who stay within the public hospitals? Does the Minister of State have the information? Secondly, with regards to the recognition of foreign doctors, is there any bilateral agreement with the other countries that we have to recognise theirs and for them to recognise ours?
: I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. I do not have the figures at hand but I would like to highlight that there are currently about 4,500 specialist doctors registered with SMC, of which only about 5%, a very small percentage, are under conditional registration. Within this group, there are only about six in the private sector and the rest are in the public sector.
With regards to whether such foreign doctors do go out into the private sector after they have fulfilled the mandatory period of conditional registration, I believe we have the figure but I hope that the Member can file a separate Parliamentary Question (PQ) so that we can give him a more complete answer.

the Minister for Social and Family Development what measures does the Ministry take to ensure that (i) all handicapped Singaporean children receive equivalent help including those with single mothers who will not benefit from Handicapped Child Relief, Working Mother's Child Relief, and Grandparent Caregiver Relief; and (ii) all Singaporean children are given an equivalent head start since those with single mothers do not benefit from the Child Development Account and Baby Bonus.
12
asked
the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how does the Ministry ensure that single mothers who earn enough to be disqualified from low-income benefits are given support to continue working to achieve and sustain self-sufficiency; and (b) whether maternity leave for single mothers can be extended from 8 weeks to 16 weeks as available to married mothers so that all Singaporean children benefit from equal foundational care.
:
Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 11 and 12 together?
:
Yes, please.
: Mdm Speaker, education and healthcare support are important to the growth and development of young children. Working mothers also need help in managing their care-giving responsibilities over their young children. The Government recognises these needs, and provides a range of support in these areas, regardless of the marital status of the children's parents.
For example, all mothers, regardless of whether they are married, are eligible for infant care and childcare subsidies. The Foreign Domestic Worker levy concession is also extended to all parents of children aged below 12, including single mothers. These help to keep care for young children affordable and enable mothers to continue to work to achieve self-sufficiency. In addition, all working mothers are eligible for childcare leave before the child turns seven years old, and extended childcare leave when the child is seven to 12 years old.
To give our children a good head start, Government funded education programmes and support in our pre-schools, early intervention centres, mainstream schools and special education schools are extended to all children. A higher level of assistance is provided to children from lower income families or those with developmental delays or special needs. Again, such support is provided independent of the marital status of their parents.
There are, however, some benefits that single mothers do not currently benefit from, such as eight additional weeks of paid maternity leave and tax incentives. These additional benefits are given to encourage and support parenthood within the context of marriage. This is the prevailing societal norm in Singapore, and one which we seek to reflect and preserve.
asked
the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry can consider extending the consolidated application form for casino self-exclusions used for foreign workers to that for local workers and religious organisations to enable the signing up of groups of citizens using the same consolidated application form.
: Mdm Speaker, the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) administers a self-exclusion system for individuals who wish to voluntarily exclude themselves from the casinos.
Today, Singapore residents can make an application online using their SingPass accounts, which is a fast and effective way to exclude themselves. To make the process more convenient to those without online access, since September last year, NCPG has made available an option for applicants to mail in hardcopy applications. These forms are available at community organisations that provide problem gambling counselling and help services, the casinos, jackpot rooms in selected clubs, and the NCPG website. NCPG is also making efforts to make the forms available at more locations.
For foreign workers who have no SingPass accounts, NCPG has provided the option of group submission. This is done through the Work Permit Online account where employers submit a consolidated application form bearing the signatures of the applicants.
Self-exclusion must be premised on individual decision, ownership and responsibility. The NCPG will work with employers and other relevant social civic organisations to assess the feasibility of having group applications, while preserving the principles of individual decision, ownership and responsibility.
: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for the reply. The basis of my question is really that the current consolidated application form for foreign workers, which is this [
the hon Member held up a form
], is good, but I would like the Ministry and CRA to consider making a form similar to this that could be extended to locals or Singaporeans. It may be done at the workplace, it may be done in different groups, and it may be done in churches, temples or mosques, but this is still on the basis of the self, the individual, wanting to be excluded but just simply making it easier.
Yes, the forms are online, you can log on with SingPass. But my driving principle is: can we make it easier? If we make this available for foreign workers, can we make it the same easier for locals?
I have in front of me also the local application form for self-exclusion and for foreigners
.
Even then, for individuals, the local form requires a few more columns to fill up. Can we make it easier? Can we make it simpler? For those who want to, I think we should make it easier. We do know that if they are excluded, the implications, going forward, would be fewer and better for Singapore.
So, I hope the Minister can consider, firstly, making this consolidated form for foreign workers available for Singaporeans. The Minister may decide whether it could be done at the workplace or at religious institutions or, for that matter, any groups. Secondly, whether the Minister can consider making the current self-exclusion form for locals even simpler. There are three areas which I find are unique to Singaporeans. We have to indicate race, religion ---
:
Mr Seah, we got the three areas. Thank you very much.
:
Mdm Speaker, the short answer to both of Mr Seah's suggestions is, "Yes". As I have explained in my answer, we are prepared to work with employers and other relevant organisations to assess and design a form that can allow for group applications. But it must still be premised on the basis of individual ownership, responsibility and individual decision. So long as we maintain these three principles, we will make it as simple as can be so that the people who are signing up know what they are signing up for, so that in the event that they want to withdraw themselves for whatever reason, they are also conscious of the fact and they take individual responsibility.
:
Thank you, Madam. Madam, I would like to go one step further than Mr Seah, my colleague. The current system is based on self-exclusion from the casinos. So, if you do not want to enter, you opt out. Would the Minister consider a self-inclusion scheme whereby you are automatically excluded and you apply to opt-in, only if you really want to visit the casino? Would the Minister consider that? Thank you.
: Mdm Speaker, today, we have both self-inclusion and self-exclusion. Self-exclusion is for individuals who want to exclude themselves. We also have third-party exclusions where family members may take up a family exclusion order against the person concerned. We also have other forms of third-party exclusions whereby some people, for example, if they are on financial assistance, are automatically excluded. So, this is the exclusion clause.
I think the Member's inclusion clause means that those who want to include themselves in this, today I think they have to pay an entrance fee. So, that would be how they include themselves. Is that what the Member meant? So, we charge them for going in. Is that what the Member was referring to?
:
Ms Denise Phua.
:
I do not mean the $100 scheme. Since the Ministry or the Government is spending so much money on the demerits of gambling, problem gambling and so forth, so I think it can be assumed that gambling or casino entry is really not something that is encouraged. Therefore, since it is not really encouraged, then why not just have a scheme whereby everybody is excluded from entering the casino, and if you want to be included, then sign up for an opt-in scheme; changing the assumption of the current scheme we have today in our country?
:
So, Ms Phua, you are suggesting an opt-in scheme plus pay $100?
:
Yes.
:
So, Minister, please.
:
I thought you opt-in because you pay $100; if you do not opt-in, you do not pay $100. If you go and buy the ticket, you pay $100, you opt in. The Member is asking for one extra step. That means, when you buy the ticket, you opt in, and then you pay $100. That would be the same as buying the ticket at $100. Or is the Member suggesting – I just want to clarify – that we have a membership scheme which I think the Member is not suggesting?
:
It should not be so easy that if you want to enter, just go to the counter and pay up $100. I think if something that is not encouraged, then why not just opt everybody out of it as a natural exclusion, and then if you want to enter, then you go and apply for what Mr Seah Kian Peng has recommended.
:
Let me try to clarify this with the Member offline because I would have thought that today, if you want to go in, you have to pay $100 and that is your Act of Inclusion. But you are suggesting that on top of paying $100, you get an extra form to apply for inclusion.
:
And then, pay $100 to enter.
:
So both.
:
Yes.
:
I see.
:
So, would the Minister consider that?
:
I am just trying to think through the mechanics of this. Let me take this back and think through the mechanics of the Member's suggestion. But I just want to clarify that you are not suggesting a membership scheme when you said the opt-in scheme? Because, personally, I will not be very supportive if you say that there is a term membership or opt-in scheme where once I sign that, then I can go anytime I want. I do not think you are suggesting that?
:
There are schemes that are based on either one is opt-in or opt-out. For the human organ donation scheme, for example, everybody is in unless they want to opt-out. So, I guess I am suggesting schemes like these.
:
In other words, the Member is suggesting all Singaporeans are prohibited unless they sign something to opt-in, plus they pay $100. So, Minister, that is the point she wants to ask you to consider. So, Minister has said he will think about it. Now, we move on to Mr Seah Kian Peng.
:
I just want to seek a clarification from the Minister. He mentioned that there is already a form and is prepared to work with groups to exclude Singaporeans to be excluded from entering the casinos. I just want to clarify that, that would be a similar form like this [
the hon Member holds up a form
] that will come up as a result, allowing, whether it is at the workplace, the churches, the temples, the mosques to organise their members to fill up this simple form for the individuals to be excluded as a whole, and not singly.
: Whether the form is exactly the same, I think we can work on it. By and large, the philosophy is that whoever opts to be excluded, they can opt-in to be excluded. Whoever chooses to be excluded may do so, so long as the application is premised on the principles of individual responsibility, accountability and individual decision. Whether it is all in one form or the organisation can help us distribute a set of forms to each individual and then we put it together for submission, I think those are mechanics that can be worked out. But as a philosophy, if an organisation, be it a church group or an employer, wants to conduct a session to encourage his or her employees or members to come and collectively sign up together, I think, even today, we have no objection to such a practice.
In fact, some organisations already do that. They may not have one consolidated form, but they will give out the forms individually to their members, and we have seen that before, whereby they compile them and passed them on to us.
So, philosophically, no difference, the thing is just how to simplify the amount of information gathered, bearing in mind that the person always makes a conscious decision because subsequently, if the person decides to withdraw himself or herself from the scheme, then there is a basis for us to act.
:
Mr Gan Thiam Poh, last question.
:
I have a supplementary question for the Minister. May I ask does the Ministry keep track of those Singaporeans who are excluded, but travel overseas to gamble?
: May I clarify: when the Member said we take care of those people who travel overseas to gamble, what do you mean? Oh, do we keep track of people who go overseas and gamble, if they have excluded themselves? Unfortunately, at this point, I must admit that I do not have jurisdiction beyond Singapore even if I would like to.
I understand what you mean, but on a more serious note, I think for those who have excluded themselves, whether is it local or overseas, the question is whether we can have the proper family support structure and community support structure to help them kick the habit.
For a very determined problem or pathological gambler, they can always find some ways to circumvent this. But, if we can have the family and the community all playing a part to try and come together to help the individual, then I think we will have another layer of defence rather than just depending on a policing system to do that. And increasingly, in the new forms of gambling, I think what we are most concerned with are not just the terrestrial gambling, like casinos or gambling dens, but the issue is one of cyber addictions, which we are most concerned about.
asked
the Minister for Education (a) how many external providers conduct sexuality education programmes in schools currently; (b) how many of these providers are paid a fee and how many do so free-of-charge; (c) whether there is a difference in feedback and evaluations from the students for the paid versus free programmes; (d) in view of it being more than five years since the Ministry engaged external providers for sexuality education programmes, whether it will conduct a review on this practice and will the practice continue in the future; and (e) how much has the Ministry spent on engaging external providers for such programmes since 2009.
(for the Minister for Education) :
Madam, MOE Sexuality Education is taught by selected teachers trained in sexuality education. Schools may engage external providers to conduct supplementary sexuality education programmes based on the needs of their students.
In 2014, seven schools engaged four approved external providers for $20,000. There were no free-of-charge programmes from 2011 to 2014. Since 2009, schools spent an estimated amount of $460,000 on such supplementary programmes, an average of $8 per student.
MOE has a stringent vetting process to select suitable external providers, trainers and relevant programmes for sexuality education in schools. Teachers sit in to observe the programme and provide feedback to MOE on the quality of the trainers and relevance of the programmes. Schools also collect feedback from their students. MOE audits schools to ensure that the programmes are delivered according to what has been approved. MOE is in the process of reviewing the system of external providers. This is part of the regular review process.
During one such review, MOE had in 2011 decided that the four-hour Relationship Module which was conducted by external providers for first year pre-university students would cease from 2015. To streamline and reduce overlaps, some of the more important learning objectives were incorporated into the revised 2015 Sexuality Education curriculum taught by MOE teachers.
:
I thank the Senior Minister of State for her answer. I seek a further clarification. According to the MOE Framework for Sexuality Education, the community is a critical partner in this whole process. Am I to understand that the use of services by external vendors constitutes part of that community partnership or is it simply a form of outsourcing?
: The majority of the programmes are actually taught by MOE-trained teachers. The external vendors are used or engaged by schools on occasions where it is not within the scope of what the MOE teachers are teaching. And this is usually when the external vendors have a particular expertise. Pornography, the cyber aspects, for example, those are areas which you may go to an external provider for; cyber safety, influence of the media and also Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)/HIV prevention, which is best done by those who are medically, who are experts in this area.
I think when the schools talk about community, what we really mean is the entire support system behind this because part of it also has to do values, the approach, your beliefs and what your parents feel is appropriate for you. So, in that broader context, the community has a part to play.
: I thank the Senior Minister of State for her clarification and answer. Earlier on, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that one area in which you would engage external providers would be in the areas of the cyber safety aspects. Recently, we had this case where 31 children being sexually groomed, for example. It was quite surprising to me. It seemed that the first 30 did not know that this was an issue until the 31st and then, the person was caught.
So, do you think that this could be enhanced, and whether our programmes on cyber wellness also includes sexual grooming and whether we can strengthen that, so that the kids are more aware in terms of the dangers in the near future.
This is more of a question of effectiveness and whether we can strengthen this aspect with our private providers, and whether this should instead be in-sourced as well, given the dangers.
: I thank the Member for raising this important topic. I think that we would agree certainly that there is room for it to be strengthened. With children, there is a range of ages, so obviously, what a Primary school child might understand would be quite different from somebody who is in Secondary school or at Junior College level. And at all stages, it is age appropriate.
Our general approach is that where possible, we would like it to be taught by MOE teachers but in areas where it needs a certain external expertise, especially when it comes to cyber wellness, understanding behaviour on the Internet, understanding how people can fall prey to predators on the Internet, sometimes you need external expertise for that. The Member's broader point about the need to strengthen this area and to ensure that our children are safe, that is taken on board and in fact, safety in the sexual context is something that MOE takes very seriously.

23
asked
the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Government will consider legislation or regulations to give more teeth to Government agencies and management corporations of retail spaces to tackle errant retailers.
(for the Minister for Trade and Industry) :
Mdm Speaker, with your permission, could I take Question Nos 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 together, please?
:
Yes, please.
: The Government's approach to consumer protection is based on promoting fair trading among retailers, and helping consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. This approach has benefited consumers and businesses, as the vast majority of our retailers are legitimate businesses who want to serve their customers well and have also established practices to resolve consumer complaints.
Unfortunately, there are a small number of errant retailers who engage in unfair trading practices to take advantage of their customers, both local consumers and tourists. We need to take action against such retailers who affect consumer confidence and dent Singapore's reputation.
Currently, the majority of consumer complaints are handled by the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) and are resolved through discussion or mediation between the parties, or by consumers going to the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT) to seek financial compensation, and over the past three years, CASE has received about 2,000 complaints against retailers in Sim Lim Square, Lucky Plaza and People's Park Centre. So, 2,000 complaints in Sim Lim Square, Lucky Plaza and People's Park Centre; only three of these malls. CASE has followed up on these complaints and mediated 1,400 cases.
The Government will work with CASE and SCT to streamline the existing claims process so that quicker action is taken to help consumers obtain compensation. We will also review the relevant legislation to strengthen the enforceability of rulings by SCT.
And civil cases, including recent incidents involving some retailers at Sim Lim Square, will be investigated by the Police under the Penal Code. Retailers who are found to have engaged in activities involving cheating, fraud or intimidation will face criminal prosecution in Court.
CASE and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) are empowered under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) to seek injunction orders against errant retailers through the Courts.
The Government will review the legislation to strengthen the provisions so that quicker action can be taken to deter unfair trading practices, and prevent errant retailers from side-stepping the restrictions under the CPFTA by forming new companies. We will study the option of appointing an agency to undertake the investigation and enforcement functions. So, as part of the review, we will study the best practices and experiences of other jurisdictions including Hong Kong and Australia, and conduct further consultation with stakeholders.
We will conclude the review and move the necessary amendments this year. While I caution that whilst we are trying to strengthen the law, putting in harsh penalties, we have to strike a balance between the consumer and the businesses as well. We do not want it to affect unnecessarily the good on the majority of the retailers, some of which are very micro enterprises or merchants in heartlands as well.
It is not necessary to put up displays at Changi Airport, as this would give visitors the wrong impression because the vast majority of retailers in Singapore are bona fide. They are good retailers. It is also more appropriate to tackle these issues at the local level. For example, CASE and STB have been working with Sim Lim Square's Management Council to provide the public with more information about complaints against specific retailers. The Management Council is also looking at ways to enhance their landlord's tenancy agreements and raise service standards of retailers at Sim Lim Square, in consultation with CASE. I meet with them periodically to find out about the progress in Sim Lim Square.
Improving consumer protection and protecting fair trading requires the collective efforts of the Government, CASE, consumers and industry players. In reviewing the legislation, MTI will take a balanced approach to protect the interests of consumers. MTI will continue to work with CASE and industry players to step up consume education efforts, to enhance consumers' awareness of their rights and help them make informed buying decisions.
:
Mr Lim Biow Chuan.
: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. If I may just declare my interest in this matter as the President of the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE). May I ask the Minister of State: currently, the Police seems to be very reluctant to follow up on some of these complaints lodged by concerns, or by tourists to investigate. What happens now is that the Police refers all such complains to CASE. As the Sim Lim Square saga has shown, some of the acts of the errant retailers are quite criminal in nature, in the sense that they charge for "unlocking fee" and "in-house insurance".
Until the review is completed, can I ask the Minister of State what other actions can we undertake to protect consumers? What we do not want is a repeat of a similar situation like the Sim Lim Square saga. The Minister of State said the review is likely to be completed at the end of the year. For the next 10 to 11 months, what kind of protection can be afforded to consumers or tourists alike?
: I did not say "end of the year". It will be earlier than end of the year. It will be within the year. We are already halfway through the review. We intend to expedite this and complete it as soon as possible. Because every day, there are buying decisions, selling decisions, and practices. We have to ensure fair practice.
On the issue of the Police, there must be a process where first, we must create enough awareness and heighten awareness about the errant retailers within the mall. We have to work with the mall very closely to do that. Secondly, timely engagement when something happens. So, that is when you need CASE, and for the mall and CASE to work together to monitor all these different complaints. There may be more complaints for one shop, or maybe it is complaints about several shops. We have to address this. So, engagement is extremely important. Once you have engaged them, you need to gather evidence – whether there are elements of fraud or more severe elements of intent where you know that there may be criminalities involved. That is where the Police can be involved to gather further evidence under the Penal Code, to say what else and what other action we can undertake. There must be a proper process.
That is exactly why we are looking into these different areas – education, case process, timely enforcement and engagement, where something needs to be coordinated. We are thinking about looking at additional resources, whether in the form of a unit or an agency, or an existing current organisation. We are figuring out what is the best way to do it efficiently and effectively to coordinate this effort. Then, we can address the issue completely.
:
I would like to thank the Minister of State for the reply. While I agree that, yes, we need to take a look at the processes, I am glad that the Ministry is doing the review now. May I ask a few supplementary questions? One, who is doing the review; who is the review committee? Two, how is the review being done now? Three, you mentioned earlier on that the review could be completed by the end of the year, and now you say it would be earlier. So, when will the review be completed? Four, will there be a public consultation when you do this review? I think consumers are looking at this very closely.
: This is a matter of urgency. We do not have to set up a committee to review an issue. Immediately, we pulled all the stakeholders in and we started working on it. These involved include inter-Ministries in the Government – MHA, Ministry of Law as well, AGC and the mall operators in getting their feedback. We have involved CASE as well. Mr Lim Biow Chuan himself is personally involved. I have just mentioned all these stakeholders in the review.
For the question on when, it definitely will not be at the end of the year. I do not foresee that we will complete this review too late. I will set a target that before mid of this year, we want to finish the whole review, and also, recommend the amendments. As for public consultation, definitely. In order to make amendments to the Act, we need to consult, not just with CASE, but also with the merchants, and with the mall operators as well. So that you can get greater acceptance before you can recommend any amendments.
:
Mdm Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Minister of State on his ability to count, at least until 23. Supplementary questions – I appreciate that he is thinking of setting up the agency and I fully support the setting up of that agency. Is the Ministry thinking of criminalising certain breaches of consumer contracts, and what is the scope of the agency? Is it likely to govern all consumer contracts or certain kinds of consumer contractors?
: I thank the Member. I can count from 1 to 15 as well! For the part on criminalising, it is not about the contract but the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act, and whether we put in the criminal penalties within the Act itself, and whether it is severe enough, whether we can define the severity and whether we want to do that. We are still considering because one of the important points of consideration is how would it affect the merchants as well, how would it affect businesses. You do not want it to open up so much that in any small little case, it will all come out. And then, the Police and every investigation officers would gather evidence, and would actually affect the business operations as a whole. The majority of the good retailers will be affected as well.
So, that is under our consideration right now. The scope of it, as you know, Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act covers all things you buy and sell at the retail sector. You are not just talking about selling electronics but every other thing. So, we have to consider it very carefully. If you want to bring in harsh penalties, what would that mean? The question would be, if we put an injunction through, and that injunction happens to be there and we publicise it, it is against the entity. Today, we already foresee that the operator himself can side-step the matter, and form another entity. That is something we are considering very carefully – to look at injunctions that effectively covers the whole scope that he would not be able to set up any entity.
:
Madam, the Minister of State mentioned about enforcement. I agree that is the key to eradicating unethical sales practices. I would like to as the Senior Minister of State whether we could consider letting the enforcement officers come in, disguised as a mystery shopper, so that they can do some form of audit or checks on some of the retailers that you receive numerous complaints about. We have to be proactive in some operations to see whether they are cases of unfair practices or misleading sales practices. So, whether some of these enforcement officers, when they receive information, can take immediate action?
:
I believe with my own sense that it is part of the investigation and evidence-gathering process, where you do something like a mystery shopper kind of work to gather evidence. On whether it is necessary to do so, first, you have to decide if this problem or complaint has the element that raises reasonable doubt that there is something needs to be done further, we need to gather more information. That is when we can carry out these mystery shopper tests. But I would also encourage the mall operators to work with the retailers. At times, they also need to do these mystery shopping tests to assess their service levels. This is something that they may want to do and not necessarily just to detect whether there is fraud or so. So, depending on the case and how severe the case and the complaint is, I believe as part of the investigation process, there may be enforcement officers going down to gather evidence in different ways. That could come later, as we discuss about the whole process.
:
First, I want to commend the Minister of State for not just for his ability to count but really doing very good work on the ground. My merchants at Sim Lim Square have given very good feedback. So, congratulations for that. The Minister of State had mentioned that the proposed legislation will be completed in mid of this year. But that leaves at least a few more months. I am wondering if the Minister of State could consider some interim measures for the next few months, before the proposed legislation is out. Perhaps, Police presence in civilian attire so that victims can report very easily at the focus areas you mentioned – People's Park, Sim Lim Square and Lucky Plaza. Implementing some of these interim measures will be in order.
: Absolutely. We have to do something right now in the interim before we complete the study. Even after we have completed the study, and making the recommendations and amendments, it would take time. So, right now, we are working closely with the affected malls, the operators. We are working with Sim Lim Square and the Management Council very closely. They are implementing certain measures within the mall, firstly, contractual obligations between the landlord or the shop-owners as well as the tenants. There are some clauses in the agreements. This was recommended by CASE: putting a clause there to make sure there is compliance to the Fair Trading Act.
Secondly, also we want to heighten awareness about those errant retailers within the malls. We want to make sure that there is a wider spread. We are working with CASE to do that, to engage all the mall operators as well as retailers in proper education and proper training.
We are also trying to look at all the complaints, monitor the complaints and where are they coming up from. Each year, we are getting an average of about 4,000 complaints. If we are getting that kind of complaints, and the tourists on average make up about 15% or so of the complaints, then, there is an issue where we are not just having to manage local consumers, but looking at making sure that the tourists will continue to come and we would not dent our own reputation. In the mean time, CASE will play a critical role in education, in working with the malls to do that. MTI is engaging the malls to make sure that on the policy side, we are looking at the relevant policies and laws, to see what are the other things that we can do.
The Police is definitely involved, but I think there is going to be a first line and second line of response. In the first line, it is very important that we have the data and the information and the complaints, and that these statistics and information are available and sufficient and enough for it to be assessed that there is an issue. If there is an issue and an element of criminality, that is when we will escalate to the Police to look at the case and gather further evidence. That is how the Police will be involved. Each time there is an issue, say something happens in a shop and CASE is involved, then, there will be an engagement officer from CASE or somebody, to talk to retailers. There is a process to help the consumers to make their complaint. When they go to CASE, they have two choices. One, is mediation, where CASE can advise them or recommend, depending on their case, that they go to the Small Claims Tribunal to make their claims.
asked
the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs in the light of complaints against errant retailers at Sim Lim Square, whether the police will carry out investigations into each complaint and take appropriate prosecution action against errant retailers who have cheated tourists and consumers so that the reputation of Singapore can be protected.
(for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs) :
Mdm Speaker, when a report or a complaint is received by the Police, they first assess the information provided, and they exercise their powers of investigation under the Criminal Procedure Code only if the information suggests that a criminal offence has been committed, for example cheating. If not, Police will advise the complainants to pursue alternative means of redress, for example filing a civil claim or seeking a court injunction.
If it appears that a criminal offence has been committed, the Police will investigate and assess the evidence gathered in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), to decide on the action to take. The AGC has the final prosecutorial discretion on whether to press charges against the offenders in Court.
The Police investigations into the recent Sim Lim Square cases are ongoing, and I am unable to comment further on that matter.

:  Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
Madam, the pawnbroking industry caters to the needs of individuals who require short-term financial relief and possess assets that can be offered as collateral. The pawnbroking industry has grown significantly since the last set of substantial amendments to the Pawnbrokers Act was moved in 1993. The number of pawnbrokers has increased from 57 in 1993 to 204 in 2013. The aggregate value of loans granted by pawnbrokers has also increased more than six times, from $856 million to $5.47 billion, during the same 20-year period. In view of these developments, it is timely to update our legislation to ensure that the regulation of pawnbrokers keeps pace with the industry's evolving business practices and the needs of pawners. Given the comprehensive nature of the amendments, the Pawnbrokers Bill repeals the existing Act and re-enacts a new Pawnbrokers Act. The key features of the Bill can broadly be divided into five categories, as follows: first, enhancement of the licensing requirements for pawnbrokers; second, refinement of the processes relating to pawn tickets; third, retention of key consumer protection provisions; fourth, removal of the existing pawnbroking auction system; and fifth, measures for the prevention of money laundering and for countering the financing of terrorism. I will discuss each part in turn.
Let me begin by discussing the enhancement of licensing requirements for pawnbrokers. Presently, pawnbrokers are required to hold a licence for carrying on their business, with it being an offence to act as a pawnbroker or to hold oneself as being in the business without a valid licence. The current licensing criteria for pawnbrokers include satisfying the Registrar that the applicant is, amongst other conditions, of "good character" and "a fit and proper person" to hold the licence. The Bill enhances the licensing requirements for pawnbrokers in the following ways.
First, the Bill imposes new statutory duties on licensees, such as the duty to maintain a minimum paid-up capital of $2 million for the first branch and $1 million for every subsequent branch; and to appoint an auditor to conduct an annual audit of their business. In addition, the amount of security deposit which licensees are required to furnish will be raised from the current $20,000 to $100,000. This is expected to enhance the pawnbrokers' compliance with the regulations.
Second, the licensing requirements will be made more stringent. For example, under clause 10 of the Bill, the Registrar will now have the power to refuse to grant or renew a licence if, amongst other matters, he is of the opinion that the director or a manager of the applicant is not a fit and proper person to carry on or manage the applicant's business; or a substantial shareholder of the applicant has carried on the business of pawnbroking within or outside Singapore in a way that renders him unfit to hold a licence. In addition, the Bill makes it an offence for a person to become a substantial shareholder, or be appointed as a director or manager of the licensee, without the Registrar's prior approval.
Third, the Bill enhances the Registrar's enforcement powers to allow for more effective regulation of pawnbrokers. For example, the Registrar will be granted powers to order a person to produce relevant information or documents in that person's possession, for the purpose of determining whether the Act has been breached. Where a licensee is convicted of an offence under the Bill, the Registrar will also have the power to: suspend the licence or vary any condition of the licence, or both; or to revoke the licence. In addition, the Registrar may order the licensee to pay a financial penalty of up to $20,000 per breach, subject to a cap of $100,000.
I now move to the refinement of the processes relating to pawn tickets. Presently, the Act requires a pawnbroker to issue a pawn ticket to the pawner when taking a pledge in pawn. The pawner needs to present the pawn ticket to the pawnbroker in order to redeem his pledge. Where a pawn ticket is lost or destroyed, the Act currently requires the pawner to go through the process of: first, going to the pawnbroker to obtain a printed form of declaration; second, making a statutory declaration before a Commissioner for Oaths or a Notary Public; and third, delivering the declaration to the pawnbroker within three days after the pawnbroker had initially provided the printed form of declaration to the pawner. There has been feedback that the current process is cumbersome and pawners have to incur an additional cost when making the statutory declaration. The Bill simplifies the process of obtaining a replacement ticket by allowing such an application to be made to the pawnbroker without the need to make a declaration before a Commissioner for Oaths or a Notary Public. The pawnbroker will only need to make reasonable inquiries to satisfy himself of the truth of the matters stated in the application and that the applicant is entitled to redeem the pledge. Once he is satisfied, he will issue a replacement ticket to the applicant directly and cancel the existing pawn ticket. To minimise the risk of this simplified procedure being misused, it will be an offence for any person to knowingly make or use a false statement in the application to obtain a replacement pawn ticket.
In addition, the Bill introduces a new provision allowing pawners to sell their pawn tickets to pawnbrokers, who are currently prohibited from purchasing pawn tickets. This provision will help to create a more competitive market as, for example, a pawner will now be able to sell his pawn ticket to another pawnbroker who may be willing to offer a more attractive price for the ticket.
Let me now discuss the key consumer protection provisions that are retained in the Bill.
Under the current Act, the pawnbroker's interest rate is capped at 1.5% per month, and any breach of this cap is an offence; and the minimum redemption period for pledges is also set at six months. These safeguards, which exist to protect the pawner, remain unchanged under the Bill.
Where a pledge has been damaged as a result of fire or is lost, the Act currently requires the pawnbroker to compensate for the value of the pledge, with the compensation amount being set at 1.5 times of the loan amount. The right to compensation in such situations will be retained in the Bill. However, the compensation will be pegged to the value of the pledge instead of the value of the loan. The reason for this is that it will be fairer to the pawner, as there could be situations where the pawner takes out a loan that is substantially lower than the value of his pledge. Thus, under clause 60 of the Bill: where the pledge is lost, the pawnbroker must provide the pawner with compensation for the value of the pledge as determined by the valuation provided by the pawnbroker at the point of pawning; and, where the pledge is damaged, the pawnbroker must allow the pawner to choose between obtaining full compensation for the value of the pledge, or having the pledge returned to the pawner along with partial compensation for the reduction in value of the pledge resulting from such damage.
The Bill also proposes the removal of the existing pawnbroking auction system. Customers provide pledges as security for pawnbroking loans. If the loans are redeemed, the items pledged are returned. When the loans are unredeemed, the pawnbroker gets to realise the pledge in satisfaction of the loan.
Mdm Speaker, the Act presently provides two ways for dealing with unredeemed pledges.
Where the pledge is pawned for $50 or less, it becomes the pawnbroker's property at the end of the time allowed for redemption.
Where the pledge is pawned for more than $50, such pledges currently have to be disposed of by sale at an auction. The pawner is entitled to any surplus generated from the auction. This surplus refers to the proceeds of the auction sale of the pledge, after deducting the pawner's outstanding debt and the auction expenses.
At present, the pledges for about 95% of pawnbroking loans are redeemed by pawners. For the remaining 5% of unredeemed pledges which are subsequently put up for auction, up to 90% of such pledges are normally uncontested at the auctions and would therefore yield no surplus to the pawners. However, the cost of holding the auctions adds to the pawnbrokers' business costs, and this is passed on to all pawners, including those who redeem their pledges and those who do not receive any surplus from the auctions.
The Bill therefore proposes to replace the auction system with one as follows: upon expiry of the redemption period, which is at least six months, if the pledge is unredeemed, the pawnbroker must issue a notice of intended forfeiture within two months of the expiry date. This will give the pawner one last chance to redeem the pawned item. If the pawner does not do so, the unredeemed pledge will be forfeited to the pawnbroker one month after the issuance of the notice of intended forfeiture. Once the pledge is forfeited, ownership of the pledge will vest with the pawnbroker and the pawner's debt will be correspondingly expunged.
With the competitive pawnbroking marketplace, this change ought to benefit pawners as pawnbrokers could possibly pass on the resultant cost savings to pawners. These may be in the form of offering lower interest rates or higher loan-to-valuation ratios for the pledges.
To safeguard the pawners' interests, the Bill requires the pawnbroker to provide an indicative valuation of the pledge to the pawner at the point of pawning, as well as to provide a fresh indicative valuation to the pawner at the end of the redemption period. This will allow the pawner to compare indicative values from different pawnshops, and allow the pawner to assess which pawnshop offers the best value for his pledge. This will enhance transparency and enable pawners to make better-informed decisions.
Mdm Speaker, the Bill also introduces a new obligation on pawnbrokers to implement adequate programmes and measures to prevent money-laundering and counter the financing of terrorism. This is part of Singapore's on-going efforts to ensure compliance with international standards and is aligned with the practices employed by other financial sectors in Singapore. Under the Bill, the key duties imposed on pawnbrokers include a duty to conduct due diligence checks on customers and a duty to file reports on any suspicious transactions or circumstances. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.
Question proposed.
:  Mdm Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill. I do have a few clarifications to make: firstly, pertaining to the Removal of the Auction Process. Currently, the public auction process is the only transparent part of the transaction and interaction with pawnbroking, in addressing unredeemed pledges. Due to this, any excess, over and above the interest, auction and administrative fees, may be returned to the pawner. Scrapping the auction process will also not likely be able to ensure pawners lower interest rates or higher loan- to-valuation ratio, as it may be intended to. One of the main reasons for this is that offers may vary quite significantly among different pawnbrokers in practice.
Secondly, in clause 21 it is stated that the "licensee must not carry on the business of pawnbroking at any place other than the licensed place of business". Can the Minister please help us understand the underlying reasons for this and also clarify if the pawnshop owner is allowed to meet and perform transaction with their clients outside their shops, for example, meeting their clients, usually their regular clients, outside their business premises.
Thirdly, in Part 3, clause 48, it is stated that "a pawnbroker must, before taking goods in pawn, give the person offering to pawn the good a valuation of the goods offered to be pawned" . As we are reviewing this business, can I ask the Ministry if the wide variations that will be obtained on such valuations, be acceptable? This is because current valuation details do not adequately identify the items, especially jewellery items. They may not reflect the prevailing market value and thus the quotes may vary as well. Perhaps the use of better descriptors or photography may be considered. This will also help us get evidence, to ensure the exact same item is sold as unredeemed pledges, after the period of expiry.
Fourthly, Madam, there is mention of the pawnbroker providing ongoing programmes to train employees on policies and procedures with reference to Part 5, clause 74. Can I enquire if the Ministry will assist in centralising some such training, for example, under WDA. This can certainly help with standardisation and maintenance of a certain quality of the training provided as well. It is also a step to help enhance the practices of the people involved in the industry.
Fifth, on the changes related to the licensing of pawnbrokers, some that I had spoken to have requested briefing and explanation on the various classes and eligibility as well as requirements. In the same context, can I also clarify with the Senior Minister of State if there are any Islamic pawnbroking businesses in Singapore currently and, if so, will they be briefed separately as well?
Madam, I support the removal of the statutory declaration as many who are involved in the transaction are our senior citizens and they really do not understand and are unfamiliar with the complex processes and the algorithm they have to go through.
In all, Madam, I feel that it is good to have some structure and regulation introduced into this industry. After all, it is also about protecting the pawners and upholding their rights. I support the Bill.
:  This Bill seeks to update the Pawnbrokers Act which was last amended in 1993. Amongst others, it removes the existing auction system, requires pawnbrokers to provide an indicative value of a pledge to the pawner at the point of pawning and at the end of the redemption period; and raises the minimum paid-up capital of pawnbrokers for the first outlet and for each subsequent branch. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill. I am concerned though, about the rise in the number of pawnshops and in the total value of pawnbooking loans in recent years.
The number of pawnshops has grown from 114 in 2008 to 217 as at June last year. The value of pawnbroking loans rose more than three times, from $2 billion in 2009 to a peak of $7.1 billion in 2012. Many of the pawnshops are in the HDB heartlands. In an earlier Parliament reply, we are told that HDB does not generally limit the number of shops of each trade and leaves it to market forces to determine the trade mix of shops, including for pawnshops.
Market forces have indeed led to the rise of the pawnbroking industry. In our geographically small island state with some 217 outlets, access to pawnshops for a quick loan is easy. This has prompted some journalists to cast the spotlight on our pawnbroking industry which now has three publicly listed pawnbrokers as key players in the market. A Bloomberg report in June last year titled "Rolex for casino cash fuels Singapore pawnshop growth" highlighted stories and statements by industry players about the rise in pawnbrokering activities driven by gambling. The report, as well as other reports, also pointed to soaring living costs as another reason for Singaporeans to turn to easy credit sources, such as pawnbrokers, to cover their living expenses.
Mdm Speaker, there is very little data available on the profile of pawners. The Ministry has said that it does not track the reasons for non-redemption of pledges. While the overall percentage is small at 5%, 5% of four million valuables pawned in 2012 works out to around 200,000 items that were unredeemed and had to be sent for auction. We do not know the reasons. We do not know how many of these 200,000 items were from pawners who repeatedly failed to redeem their valuables. We also do not know the reasons for these non-redemptions. I would like to call for a more detailed study on the profile of pawners and on the industry. In particular, we should look at those who do not redeem their valuables to understand the underlying reasons. Also, in order not to become a society with excessive pawning, the study can also look into the appropriate number of outlets in each neighbourhood, and if the level and content of advertising should be subjected to some form of controls. I believe better data would be helpful to help look into the underlying causes of the rapid rise in the pawnbrokering trade and how we can tweak the Pawnbroker's Bill in future to continue to keep pace with this industry's changing landscape.
:  Mdm Speaker, it was revealed in July last year the number of pawnshops grew to 204 from 163 in 2010 and the pawnbroking loans granted last year was $5.5 billion. At the same period, 95% of the pledges were redeemed. It is indeed a very lucrative business for the pawnshop industry.
The Pawnbrokers Bill provides the legislative basis for regularity pawnbrokers in Singapore with updated laws governing the pawnbroking industry to ensure they remain relevant, keeping pace with changes in the money lending and financial industry in general.
The Ministry of Law has proposed further amendments to the Bill, such as removing the auction system, improving protection for pawners, strengthening governance of the pawnbroking industry and updating technical changes to various provisions in the Act.
I support the Bill generally but wish to seek clarifications and make proposals for the Minister to consider. Can the Minister clarify why there is a need to remove the existing auction system when there were only 5% unredeemed pledges last July. How does it result in cost savings for pawnbroker to benefit pawners through getting a higher valuation upfront from the pawnshops?
Clause 61(1), under forfeiture and effect, I would also like to propose for the Minister to consider giving a longer extension period of three months from the date of the notice to redeem their pledge before pawnbrokers take action. It is only fair the pawners be given time to find a way on how to redeem their pledge as these belongings may have a lot of sentimental value and attachment to them, some of which items cannot be duplicated in the market and lost forever. In the old days, I had seen women cried when they lost their valued belongings, for example, a heavy gold bangle given as a dowry, just because of their inability to redeem them.
Pawnbrokers will be required to provide an indicative valuation of a pledge to a pawner twice at the time of pawning and at the end of a redemption period. I would like to propose that pawnbrokers use the service of a certified gemologist or a certified valuer to give a fair appraisal of the valuation of the pledge for optimal value, which is also a service to the public.
Pawnbrokers are required to maintain a minimum paid-up capital of $2 million for their first branch, and an additional $1million for subsequent branch. The security deposit which licensees are required to furnish is $100,000. Could I ask the Minister, does the Bill also mandate insurance cover against burglary or fire within the pawnbrokers' premises for storage of pledges?
Will the interest rate be capped lower than the 1.5% per month after the removal of the existing auction system as pawnbrokers are likely to pass on the resultant cost savings which may be in the form of lower interest rates?
Finally, will the Minister consider introducing online pawnbroking as done in the US since 2009?
Madam, we have an online gambling Bill, but should there be another schedule for online pawnshops under Pawnbrokers Bill in future?
:  Thank you, Mdm Speaker. The new Bill comes on the back of recent developments to Singapore's pawnbroking scene. The industry now has a softer image. New pawnshops are modern, brightly-lit and inviting – a sea change from the intimidating grilled storefronts some of us will recall. Pawnbroking is also on the rise. I will not recite or repeat the statistics that have been recited in this Chamber, but clearly the business is booming.
Is this something we ought to be concerned about? Arguably, pawnbroking loans, being secured loans, pose less of a risk to the customer or pawner. The pawner cannot borrow beyond his means as he is limited by the value of the collateral. Also, should he be unable to make repayment, he forfeits the pawned goods and that is the end of his debt. There is no danger of the debt snowballing and affecting his other assets. Yet, we should not overlook the fact that there may be troubling reasons why more are seeking quick cash or short-term loans. More could be under financial strain, forcing them to pawn their belongings to make ends meet. Or, credit may be too difficult to obtain from moneylenders and financial institutions. Accordingly, I would like to ask the Ministry whether the Ministry has data explaining the surge in pawnbroking activity. Also, what is the Government doing to monitor the situation?
Moving on to the specifics of the Bill, I would like to raise several points for consideration and clarification.
The first has to do with the removal of the auction system. The intention behind this is to enable cost savings to be passed on to pawners. However, one consequence of this change is that pawnbrokers are no longer obliged to return any surplus from the realisation of the pledge to the pawner. Instead, they keep the surplus. That being the case, pawnbrokers may be incentivised to give unfairly low valuations because any surplus goes straight into their pockets. To some extent, competition between pawnbrokers for business may reduce such practices. Still, there is a danger that low valuations may become an industry-wide phenomenon, erasing the intended cost benefit to the pawner. What are the measures in place to ensure fair business practices?
Further, it appears from the proposed section 48(3) and section 62(2) that a pawner or third party who has suffered loss can claim against the pawnbroker if it is shown that the pawnbroker did not act in good faith or did not take reasonable care in giving the valuation. Can the Minister clarify what this means and how this may be demonstrated?
My second point concerns section 60. If the pawnbroker loses or damages the pawned good, the pawner is entitled to be compensated with reference to the valuation at the time it first took possession of the pledge, and that is set at section 60(5). However, the value of the goods may have increased or decreased since the point of pawning. Concerns of fair valuation aside – keeping in mind the incentive to give low valuations – surely the loss suffered by the pawner is more accurately represented by the good's valuation at the point of redemption. After all, this is the value of the goods the pawner would have received had it not been for the pawnbroker's default. This provision also lends itself to abuse. Where the value of the pawned goods has risen – say in the case of gold bar or jewellery – an unscrupulous pawnbroker may pretend to misplace the goods and then later sell it off. The pawnbroker benefits from doing so as it only compensates the pawner the amount of the valuation at the point of pawning. In view of this, could the Minister explain the rationale behind section 60(5)?
Next, a similar complication arises under section 65. This section governs the pawnbroker's wrongful realisation of the pledge. Once again, the pawner is entitled to be compensated with reference to the valuation at the point of pawning. According to section 65(1)(b), if this valuation is lower than the loan and profit secured by the pledge, the loan and profit are extinguished. But, the amount actually realised by the pawnbroker in selling the pledge may be higher than the valuation. There may be a surplus. Does this surplus go into the pawnbroker's pocket? If so, this again rewards pawnbrokers who deliberately give low valuations and then wrongfully realise the security.
To say that the pawnbroker has no property to pledge is not an answer, as he may have on-sold it to third parties. Neither does a pawnbroker who wrongfully realises a pledge commit an offence. It appears that the existing offence under section 33(g) of the existing Act has been removed in the Bill. What is the rationale behind removing this offence? I hope the Minister will clarify this issue as well.
Fourth, a point on section 67 which seeks to protect the rightful owner of the goods that have been wrongfully pawned. Under section 67(4)(b), in the absence of a court order, a pawnbroker may choose whether or not to deal with the pledge. This is so even when there is a dispute pending between different persons who are claiming to be the owner of the goods. It is questionable if giving pawnbrokers this discretion truly protects the rightful owner.
A pawnbroker that refuses to deal with the pledge cannot charge interest on the loan in section 67(6). Consequently, rather than continuing to store the goods, a pawnbroker will likely allow its redemption or sell it off. Perhaps the purpose of this section would be better achieved if the pawnbroker is prevented from dealing with the pledge for a fixed period upon receiving notice. This would give the rightful owner sufficient time to obtain a court order. This protection is especially important where there is sentimental value attached to the wrongfully pawned goods, as in the case of a family heirloom. In such cases, monetary compensation would not suffice.
Fifth, some points of clarification on section 66. Subsection (4) is unclear as to what the pawnbroker must do after receiving an application from a person who claims to be entitled to redeem a pledge but does not have a pawn ticket. What "reasonable inquiries" are pawnbrokers expected to carry out? Would cross-referencing the applicant's details with its own records suffice? Additionally, section 66(7), which is similar to section 67(5), is unclear. I would like to clarify in what instance the pawnbroker will receive immunity when he omits to do something. It is a very strange way of drafting the Bill in my view.
My final point is a practical one. Part 5 of the Bill introduces a new obligation for pawnbrokers: to develop and implement measures to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. This is a timely move given the growth of the pawnbroking industry. My concern is that the Bill's requirements, which are understandably complex and numerous, may be challenging for smaller pawnbroking businesses to implement.
For example, under section 74(2)(a)(i-ii), a pawnbroker must "take appropriate steps to identify, assess and understand the money laundering and terrorism financing risks" in relation to its pawners and the jurisdictions which its pawners are from or in. Pawnbrokers may not know what steps are needed to be taken or where to begin. In fact, these requirements are even difficult for banks or lawyers and other professionals who are expected to have money laundering regulations or systems in place. As such, I would like to ask whether the Ministry will assist pawnbrokers to understand what they need to do and help them implement such systems.
:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Members for their support of the Bill and would like to address the comments and queries that they have raised.
Mr Hri Kumar, Mr Yee Jenn Jong and Mrs Lina Chiam had talked about the increase in the number of pawnbroking loans as well as the number of pawnbrokers. The increase in the value of the loans disbursed by the pawnbroking industry depends on two things: First, the demand for credit; and second, the price of gold, the reason being that most pledges are actually gold items and the price of gold has increased significantly over the past five years. So we, therefore, think that there is a strong correlation between the increase in the price of gold and the increase in the value of pawnbroking loans.
With the corresponding increase in the total value of the loans, there have been new entrants to the industry, and an increase in the number of pawnshops run by chain operators who may be benefiting from economies of scale. The industry, as a whole though, has been law-abiding and there are few complaints about pawnbrokers.
We have, nevertheless, retained key provisions to protect consumers which are, as I mentioned earlier, that the interest rate continues to be capped at 1.5% per month and that any breach of this cap is an offence and the minimum redemption period of pledges is set at six months. The Ministry of Law will continue to monitor the industry closely.
I move on now to the next point which was raised by Members and that is the removal of the auction system. This was raised by Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mrs Lina Chiam and Mr Hri Kumar. As mentioned in my speech earlier, actually, 95% of pawnbroking loans are redeemed by the pawners. We are really talking about the remaining 5%. And of the 5% that are not redeemed, 90% are uncontested and, as I mentioned earlier, therefore yield no surplus to the pawners. We are actually talking about 10% of the 5%. The benefits of the auction system are enjoyed only by a very small number of pawners who might receive a surplus from the auctions.
On the other hand, the high costs of running regular auctions are borne by all the pawners. The pawnbroking industry is competitive and pawners are able to easily shop around for the best deal. So, there is a strong incentive for pawnbrokers to pass on cost savings to pawners and the new system will also require pawnbrokers to send pawners a notice of forfeiture. The notice will provide a valuation of the pledge as of the time of this issuance and the fresh indicative valuation will enable the pawner to make an informed decision about whether or not to redeem the pledge.
Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef also inquired about the valuations provided by the pawnbrokers and asked us to consider the use of better descriptors or photographs as valuation details may not adequately identify the items. Before the item is pawned, the pawner will furnish the pledge to the pawnbroker to obtain the valuation. After the item is pawned, the pawnbroker will be required to issue a pawn ticket that contains information such as a fair description of the pledge, including any manufacturer's serial number or other identifiable mark. This is, therefore, not necessary.
There were also other queries on valuations, such as whether wide variations in the valuations obtained would be acceptable, whether pawnbrokers might be incentivised to give unfairly low valuations and whether someone may claim against the pawnbroker if the pawnbroker did not act in good faith or take reasonable care in providing the valuation.
Strong competition in the pawnbroking industry will act as an effective check against pawnbrokers providing depressed valuations, since pawners will be able to shop around for the most favourable deal. With redemption rates at over 95%, there is little incentive for a pawnbroker to offer a depressed valuation at the time of taking the goods in pawn. A depressed valuation will mean a smaller loan can be extended. A depressed valuation provides a strong incentive for the pawner to sell the pawn ticket to another pawnbroker who will then redeem the pledge. Pawnbrokers who consistently offer depressed valuations are also likely to suffer reputational damage and may very well go out business in a competitive industry.
Further, as Mr Kumar noted, the pawnbrokers may be liable for any loss or damage suffered by the pawner or third party, as a result of relying on the valuation provided by the pawnbroker if he did not act in good faith or take reasonable care in providing the valuation. Pawnbrokers will, therefore, have strong incentives to ensure that the valuation reflects the market value of the pledge. If the valuation is challenged, the court will ascertain whether the pawnbroker had acted in good faith or had taken reasonable care in giving the valuation. The court will examine all the relevant factors such as the manner in which the pawnbroker had conducted the valuation and the level of skill or expertise involved. And in this regard, it is no different from any other type of dispute where the value of an item is disputed and the court has to take into account all relevant factors to see whether the valuation given was a fair and proper one.
Mr Kumar also asked about the rationale for pegging the compensation to the valuation provided by the pawnbroker at the point of pawning. Pawnbrokers have strong incentives to ensure that this valuation reflects the market value of the pledge. This valuation also reflects the value that both parties had agreed on when entering into the transaction. Pegging the compensation to the value of the pledge at the time of redemption could also result in lower compensation for the pawner since the value of the pledge may have decreased.
Mr Kumar asked where the pawnbroker has wrongfully realised the pledge, whether the surplus goes to the pawnbroker and what the rationale was for removing the offence of dealing with any pledge in any manner that is not authorised by the Pawnbrokers Act. Where there is a surplus arising from the pawnbroker's wrongful realisation of the pledge, the pawner may file a claim against the pawnbroker to recover the surplus. Where such wrongful realisation of the pledge involves criminal misconduct, the persons involved may be effectively dealt with under the Penal Code or other relevant criminal statutes.
There were also a number of questions about the protection of rightful owners of goods wrongfully pawned. Mr Kumar asked whether the pawnbroker should be given the discretion to deal with the pledge after receiving a notice from a person who claims to be the rightful owner of goods that were wrongfully pawned. Clause 67(4)(b) of the Bill provides the pawnbroker with the option to deal with the pledge as he deems fit in such circumstances, if there is no court order relating to the pledge. Where the pawnbroker proceeds to deliver the pledge to another party who is not the rightful owner, the pawnbroker may be liable for the tort of conversion under the common law. However, the clause also enables the pawnbroker to refuse to deal with the pledge for a period of three months after receiving the notice without being liable for any loss or damage caused. As Mr Kumar observes, this period of three months will give the rightful owner sufficient time to obtain a court order relating to the pledge.
With regard to the replacement of pawn tickets, Mr Kumar had asked what "reasonable inquiries" the pawnbrokers are expected to carry out. The example Mr Kumar provided of cross-referencing the applicant's details against the pawnbroker's records is one way in which the pawnbroker may satisfy the test of making "reasonable inquiries". Where the applicant is not the pawner, the applicant may be asked to provide receipts as evidence of the purchase of the pledge. In this regard, it also should be noted that any applicant who makes a false claim commits an offence under the Penal Code. In addition, I confirm that clauses 66(7) and 67(5) will only protect the pawnbroker from any loss or damage where it has done or omitted to do anything in accordance with their respective clauses.
Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about the licensing conditions for pawnbrokers, what the rationale was for not permitting a licensee to carry on the business of pawnbroking at any place other than the licensed place of business and whether a pawnbroker can meet or perform transactions with their clients outside their business premises. As pawnbroking transactions involve cash and valuable items, pawnbrokers are not allowed to conduct their business outside their licensed place of business for security reasons. You can imagine what would happen if a big diamond ring was displayed in the middle of a coffee shop and somebody is claiming that this cost $200,000. It is not a very good idea. In deciding whether or not to grant a licence, the Registrar considers whether the pawnbroker has put in place adequate security measures at his place of business, such as by installing CCTVs and security alarm systems.
Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked whether pawnbrokers could be briefed about the new licensing conditions. The Registry of Pawnbrokers did in fact conduct a briefing on the Bill to the industry in November 2014, including on the new licensing requirements. Individuals with further queries may contact the Registry for assistance.
On money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, in response to Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Mr Hri Kumar, I would say these measures to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing are similar to those imposed in other financial sectors in Singapore, such as the banking sector, and the Ministry will work together with other relevant Government agencies to see how best to provide guidance to the industry.
Assoc Prof Lateef asked how many Islamic pawnbroking businesses there are in Singapore currently, and whether they will be briefed. There are currently no licensed Islamic pawnbrokers in Singapore. The Registry of Pawnbrokers has not received any application to set up an Islamic pawnbroking business. And if there were to be any, Islamic pawnbrokers would be subject to the same regulations as other pawnbrokers in Singapore.
Mr Yee Jenn Jong had inquired about the various reasons for people taking up pawn loans and also referred to cost of living and other expenses. In response, I would make a number of points. Pawnbroking loans are secured loans. The pawner needs to furnish items of personal property as collateral in exchange for a loan from the pawnbroker. So, in this regard, the amount of loan the pawner can take up is limited by the value of his collateral and given the nature of pawnbroking loans, it is unlikely that the increase in the number of pawnshops would result in people over extending themselves in credit. This is in response to his comment about the number of pawnshops there are.
The Registry of Pawnbrokers does not impose a cap on the number of pawnshops at any locality. People pawn items for various reasons and not necessarily for the purpose of gambling. Ultimately, individuals have to take personal responsibility for their finances. They should not gamble or borrow beyond their means.
In response specifically to the point that Mr Yee raised about cost of living, I think that what we should do is look at two groups of people: those who really cannot afford and whose income does not allow them to meet their expenses, and those whose income does allow them to meet their expenses, but for various reasons they over-extend themselves. For those who have over-extended themselves, then, of course, it should be important that they should review how they used their finances and spend within their means. But for those who are genuinely in need, this Government has always been ready to assist and the Government does, in fact, provide assistance. There are subsidies for education, healthcare, housing and childcare. There are GST vouchers which include cash, rebates to offset utility bills and a top-up to the CPF Medisave account. There are service and conservancy charges rebates. There are programmes and schemes for persons with disabilities. There is a Community Health Assist Scheme. There is the MOE bursary and financial assistance scheme. There are the CDC, CCC bursary, CPF housing grants, Workfare Income Supplement, ComCare assistance, Medifund and Public Assistance. So for those, it would not be necessary for them to take their items to pawn, they should actually tap on these Government assistance schemes which are put in place specifically to assist those of low income and who are in need of help.
: Are there any further clarifications from Members for the Senior Minister of State? Mrs Lina Chiam.
:
I thank the Senior Minister of State for all the answers. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State about online pawnshop broking. Is it possible that Singapore can establish one?
:
May I clarify with the Member whether the Member is suggesting that we should have online pawnbroking? Or is the Member saying we should not have online pawnbroking?
:
I just want to know whether the Senior Minister of State would consider introducing online pawnbroking, as done in the US since 2009, in future.
:  Well, I think that one of the things we would have to do is to look at this in the context of the comments which the Members have raised. I think three Members - Mrs Chiam, Mr Yee and Mr Kumar – have stood up to express concern about the surge in the number of pawnbroking loans. And as I have explained, that is really related to the demand as well as the price of gold, but I think the underlying concern was behind that, it is actually whether or not people might overextend themselves in credit. So even as the pawnbroking industry stands as it is today, I have had queries from three Members on whether that is something we should be concerned about. So, we think that the state of the industry, as it is today, can be addressed by this Bill, and we would be very cautious before we would want to go with any online pawnbroking.
The short answer is at the moment, it is not under consideration. It is something we would have to review and think about very carefully because we have to keep a balance between ensuring that there is enough credit available for those in need and, at the same time, not making it so easy that people over-extend themselves.
:  I thank the Senior Minister of State for her responses. Can I clarify something she said? She said that the loan extended will not exceed the valuation, and I am not sure that there is a provision in the Act for that. The reason why I am concerned about low market valuations or artificially low valuations is simply this – if I could just illustrate with an example. If the pledge is worth $120 and the pawnbroker extends a loan of $100, he may be incentivised to provide a valuation of $80. So, when a pawner comes to redeem, he has to redeem $100 loan plus a profit. But if the pawner has to sell the collateral, he gets $120 because that is what it is worth. But if he loses the item or destroys the item or misplaces or does something wrongful with it, he only compensates the pawner $80, and that is my concern about artificially low valuations – where if the valuation is low enough, it provides the incentive for the pawnbroker to actually not do his job properly.
Insofar as market forces are concerned, I do not think that is going to be a right answer because where the pawner is concerned, he is only looking at the amount of loan he gets and not so much the valuation which the pawnbroker gives him.
:
With respect to the question, where Mr Kumar suggested that the loan extended would exceed or would not exceed the valuation, can I just clarify that first point?
:
The loan extended may well be below the value of the pledge but above the valuation in writing which the pawnbroker gives him.
:
I think it is not possible to micro manage each transaction. So if you look at it from a broad basis, I think, generally speaking, he would have known the pawnbroker would not have an incentive to depress the loan amount too low because it is possible for the pawner to go to another pawnbroker. If it is something that falls within a reasonable range, the pawner may well be happy to live with it. But the pawner also – when you have an item, you would not necessarily go to the first pawnbroker – it is open to you to go to other pawnbrokers and see what is the best deal that you can get, and our assumption is that people will actually work on this premise. We will see how the system goes, but if it turns out that there are abuses of the nature that Mr Kumar describes, then it may be necessary at a later point to intervene. At the moment, based on what we see, we think that this would be a workable system but we will monitor and review.
:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for a very detailed reply especially on how Singaporeans can cope with the cost of living.
I noted that in the previous replies by the Ministry on this topic, they said that we did not track the reasons for non-redemption and there were also various reports, some of which I have cited, that quoted industry players saying about how pawners use their valuables to get cash for casinos and gambling, as well as to cover cost of living. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State if the Ministry would like to more conclusively reply to all these comments by having a more detailed study about the reasons behind all these non- redemptions and about the profile of the pawning industry.
:  It is a little difficult to track this kind of information because when a person goes to pawn an item – if he pawns it – and then you do not know at that point of time whether or not he is going redeem it, so you will only know when somebody has not redeemed it when he has not redeemed it. And then it would be a question of asking the pawnbrokers for the details, and even then you will have to go and track down the person and say, why did you not redeem this piece of jewellery, what is the reason for not doing so. You can see the kind of logistical difficulty that you would have in doing that, and that is one of the reasons why we have not been able to track this.
We will take note of Mr Yee's request but at the present time we are really talking about 5% which go unredeemed, and the reasons that were given are largely anecdotal. We will look at it and keep Mr Yee's request under consideration, but as I have said, logistically, it is very difficult to pinpoint with mathematical accuracy what are the exact reasons why people do not redeem.
: There are no further clarifications.

:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time".
Sir, the proposed changes to the Industrial Relations Act, or the IR Act, are intended to better meet the needs of our professionals, managers and executives, or PMEs, as well as help employers and unions to work together to more effectively engage this growing group of employees. We will be strengthening an already strong and constructive tripartite partnership, and making it more inclusive.
The Industrial Relations Act, or the IR Act, sets the landscape for harmonious labour-management relations. The law helps to prevent and settle trade disputes by collective bargaining, facilitates conciliation and arbitration; and helps to provide for tripartite mediation of individual disputes. Over the years, it has allowed us to meet the growing needs of all our workers. At the same time, it ensures that our companies remain competitive and agile so that they can respond to the changing business environment, and thereby benefitting everyone.
Sir, we know that the profile of our workforce is evolving. PMEs now form more than 30% of our workforce and this proportion is expected to increase further as Singaporeans become better educated and aspire to better jobs.
As such, we need to see how this group of employees can be better represented at the workplace and how we can better embrace them into the tripartite process. At the same time, we need to see how employers can better work together with unions to engage these employees. The tripartite partners agreed that we would do this in a measured and sensible way without undermining labour market flexibility and management prerogatives on issues which the unions can enter into negotiations with management.
To enable this, tripartite partners have taken the approach of gradually broadening the options for workplace representation for PMEs. In fact, this journey started back in 2002 when we amended the IR Act to allow rank-and-file unions to represent employees in managerial and executive positions on an individual basis for limited matters. In 2011, we introduced further amendments to provide for a tripartite mediation mechanism to assist PMEs in non-unionised companies in resolving individual disputes with their employers.
In the last two to three years, the Government has also undertaken a broad review of our laws and institutions to see how we can better meet the changing needs of our workforce. As a result, we updated the Employment Act last year to deepen protection for managers and executives earning up to $4,500. We also plan to set up an Employment Claims Tribunal to provide all employees, including PMEs, with an expeditious and affordable dispute resolution mechanism; and strengthen the tripartite mediation mechanism we introduced in 2011.
In 2012, alongside the review of the Employment Act, tripartite partners agreed it was timely to review the IR Act to see how unions can play a role to better represent the needs of these PMEs. The amendments we are proposing today seek to build on these changes to further strengthen the channels of union representation for PMEs and provide them with a wider set of options for union representation. I shall refer to these workers as "executives" henceforth for alignment with the terminology in the Bill. They are the result of extensive consultations with the public, as well as more than 4,000 employers and union leaders at various platforms.
A Tripartite Consultation Workgroup with employer and union leader representatives was also set up to study issues relating to amendments in the IR Act and to develop tripartite understanding and guidelines to guide implementation on the ground.
The two main changes addressed in this Bill are:
(a) Firstly, extending the scope of union representation on a collective basis for executives; and
(b) Secondly, expanding the scope of limited representation on an individual basis to re-employment matters.
I will elaborate on each of these in more details. The first key amendment proposes to remove the legal barrier for rank-and-file unions to represent executives collectively. Executives presently cannot be collectively represented by rank-and-file unions. This prohibition was introduced in the context where the large majority of employees were traditional rank-and-file workers and executives then constituted a very thin but senior layer of the workforce of a company. There were concerns that representation of such workers by rank-and-file unions would give rise to a conflict of interest and undermine management effectiveness.
Since then, our economy has evolved and the educational profile of our workforce has improved – it has changed quite dramatically and will continue to change. There is now a much greater variety of jobs, especially at executive levels, from entry level jobs to senior management roles. Recognising that rank-and-file unions have played an effective role to help rank-and-file members address their workplace issues, tripartite partners recommended to provide an additional option for executives, particularly the more junior ones, to join rank-and-file unions for collective representation if they wish. This is an extension of the 2002 amendment, where executives were allowed to be represented by rank-and-file unions on an individual basis for limited matters.
Some employers are concerned that such representation may give rise to a conflict of interest and undermine management effectiveness. To address this concern, we will continue to exclude executives with certain responsibilities from joining the rank-and-file unions for collective representation. These include executives:
(a) who are employed in a senior management position;
(b) with substantial responsibilities for hiring, firing, promotion, dismissal and disciplinary duties;
(c) employees who represent employers' interest in union-management matters;
(d) those with access to confidential information, such as payroll and budgeting information; and
(e) whose union affiliation would give rise to a conflict of interest.
Tripartite partners have discussed a few criteria to be used to determine eligibility for collective representation such as salary levels and workforce distribution, but they recognise that company structures and pay-scales differ widely across industries and between organisations. Partners thus agreed that job function or responsibility is probably the most relevant and practicable criterion for determining eligibility, as it directly addresses employers' concerns of conflict of interest and loss of management effectiveness. This approach will also be able to take into account the organisational structure and circumstances of different industries or organisations. This is similar to the criterion for limited representation and tripartite mediation for executives within the IR Act itself.
The second key amendment in this Bill proposes to expand the scope of areas which the rank-and-file unions can represent executives on an individual basis include matters relating to re-employment.
Sir, currently, rank-and-file unions can represent executives on an individual basis in four limited areas, specifically, firstly, breach of individual contract of employment, secondly, retrenchment benefits, thirdly, unfair dismissal and, fourthly, victimisation. This provides executives with an additional and lower cost alternative to settle their employment disputes through union and management negotiations.
While the tripartite partners have proposed extending the scope of collective representation of executives by rank-and-file unions, there is still value in retaining the limited representation framework which I have just mentioned. Employers have given feedback that reward systems for executives have evolved to be relatively individualised and not all executives will desire to be represented collectively. In addition, not all existing rank-and-file unions may be prepared or given recognition to full collective representation immediately.
To further broaden executives' options for workplace representation, tripartite partners have recommended expanding the scope of limited representation framework to include matters relating to re-employment after retirement. These include:
(a) Firstly, the denial of re-employment to an employee on the ground that the employee does not satisfy the re-employment eligibility criteria;
(b) Secondly, the denial of re-employment to an employee on the ground that the employer is unable to find a vacancy in his establishment which is suitable for the employee;
(c) Thirdly, the reasonableness of the terms and conditions of any re-employment offer made by the employers; and
(d) Lastly, the reasonableness of the amount of any employment assistance payment offered to an employee.
In addition to the two key amendments that I elaborated on earlier, this Bill also proposes some amendments to improve the functioning of the Industrial Arbitration Court, by allowing for flexibility on the number of employer and employee panel members which the Minister for Manpower can appoint to hear industrial disputes as well as increasing the duration of appointment of such panel members from one to two years.
Sir, in view of the two earlier proposed amendments, consequential amendments to the Retirement and Re-employment Act and the Trade Unions Act are required. In the case of the Retirement and Re-employment Act, the amendment is to allow the unions to also represent executives under the limited representation framework in proceedings before the Commissioner for Labour on re-employment claims. Amendments to the Trade Unions Act are also required so as to enable rank-and-file unions to represent executive employees, except executive employees with certain responsibilities, for collective bargaining.
The Bill is proposed to come into effect on 1 April 2015. To supplement the proposed amendments, we have released two sets of Tripartite Guidelines at the Singapore Tripartism Forum's Industrial Relations Seminar in November last year to help prepare unions and employers early so that they can address their concerns about how they should adapt to the proposed amendments. These guidelines are the result of the extensive efforts of the Tripartite Consultation Workgroup I mentioned earlier.
The first set of Tripartite Guidelines on Extending the Scope of Union Representation for Executives spells out the various options for representation of executives and provides supplementary criteria for unions and companies to negotiate on the level of executives in the organisation eligible for collective representation so that both parties can move at a pace that they are comfortable with. The second set of Tripartite Guidelines on Expanding the Scope of Limited Representation for Executives is an update of the existing guidelines in relation to the limited representation framework, where individual re-employment disputes are included as an additional area for negotiation between employers and unions.
Following the various consultation sessions the Ministry had with employers and union leaders, there was tripartite agreement that while the guidelines should provide clarity, they should also not be overly prescriptive. This is to allow flexibility at the implementation level for employers and unions to work out the modalities that best suit the needs of executives and the organisational circumstances.
I know that in many cases, we would all like clearer and more precise directions, but the nature of the space is not homogenous. Therefore, you do need a level of flexibility and with that, we need to create that space so that the partners can negotiate and discuss what these details might be and for them to proceed from that point on. I am happy to note that the Workgroup members took this into consideration in developing the tripartite guidelines and as a result, these guidelines have broad tripartite support.
In this regard, I would like to urge employers and unions to consider the various options available to them by openly sharing, discussing and understanding each other's concerns and needs, and to work out a suitable arrangement. The guidelines will take effect together with the commencement of these amendments to the IR Act.
Mr Deputy Speaker, we started this very important journey to provide greater scope for representation for executives as far back as 2002. We have, over the many years, built up a very strong tripartite partnership here in Singapore. We do intend to keep to that. The basis on which we have established that successful partnership, we intend to continue with that. But the space is also evolving; the economy is evolving; the workforce is evolving, and therefore, we need to find a new formulation that can continue on this trajectory.
The legislative amendments that I have proposed will offer more options for union representation of executives at the workplace, because we do have many more executives in the workplace today, and it will continue. It will allow us to harness established channels under the IR Act for employers, executives and unions to engage in dialogue to resolve any industrial disputes.
I would like to, in particular, thank everyone who has contributed to the review, especially NTUC, SNEF and Members of this House as well as the members of this Workgroup for their contributions in developing the guidelines. MOM will continue to work with our partners, NTUC and SNEF, to communicate the IR Act changes and the tripartite guidelines to employers, unions and employees, to ensure that the proposed amendments are implemented in a way that creates a win-win outcome for both employees and employers, as we have done so over the many years. We are confident that the proposed amendments will make our tripartite model even more inclusive. It will strengthen Singapore's model of tripartism and benefit employees, unions and employers. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.
Question proposed.
:  I rise in strong support of the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill. I declare my interest as a member of the tripartite workgroup for the review of the Employment Act as well as the Industrial Relations (IR) Act. Representing NTUC and the Labour Movement, we discussed, consulted widely, reviewed, negotiated and promulgated this deck of changes with our tripartite partners, Ministry of Manpower and Singapore National Employer's Federation. I must say that the discussions and negotiations were robust. We also worked out and issued a deck of tripartite guidelines which were issued shortly after the first reading of this Bill.
If we take a closer look at our Singapore's workforce profile, it is changing rapidly. The number of Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) in our workforce now stands at 31.1%. Resident PMEs currently stand at 638,500. We expect this percentage to increase exponentially with more embarking on tertiary qualifications and taking on executive jobs and becoming knowledge workers. Many of the new employees hired in our unionised companies these past years have Diploma and above qualifications. Many of the new jobs created require knowledge workers or PMEs.
In light of this change and development, it is imperative for NTUC and the Labour Movement to push for this review of the IR Act, a piece of legislation promulgated in 1965, to ensure we stay future-ready and relevant to our workforce and membership. In fact, I submit that it is in the interests of our tripartite partners to support this move to be inclusive and bring PMEs into the tripartite framework so as to fortify tripartism in Singapore and ensure it stays strong, relevant and continues to be the unique selling proposition for Singapore.
The introduction of individual limited representation of executives in 2002 and setting up of the tripartite mediation framework in 2011 have been two key milestones in bringing PMEs into our fold and extending union representation to them. However, in this Amendment Bill, I cannot but underline the two key changes in this Amendment Bill which are landmark changes in our journey to outreach and serve the PME populace in Singapore.
The first change is a watershed change to allow trade unions whose majority of membership consists of non-executive and non-managerial employees, commonly referred to as Rank-and-File Unions, be allowed to collectively represent PMEs.
The second change is the addition of re-employment as another head of claim under individual limited representation. These changes are by no means technical changes but substantive changes as our unions will be able to stretch their scope of representation and ensure the welfare and interests of all workers including PMEs as well as matured PMEs can be looked after and that they can be collectively represented by unions. Except certain excluded categories due to conflict of interests principles, there will not be a salary ceiling nor prescribed percentages and proportions to specifically curtail collective union representation of PMEs.
Supporting these changes, I seek Minister's clarifications on some questions which I hope he can explain and elucidate so as to aid the practice of industrial relations after these changes are passed as law.
In fact, one of the biggest challenges with coming up with the new provisions as well as the set of tripartite guidelines, is how to best define the term "executives" and consequently where to draw the line of exclusion from union representation. Section 17(3) provides for some excluded categories of workers from this new collective representation of PMEs by our affiliated unions. I wish to confirm that the intention is to only exclude those who are in senior management positions or carrying out functions that would genuinely create conflict.
I ask this because the excluded categories are the same as those excluded under individual limited representation. When limited representation was introduced in 2002, the Minister said in Parliament that the Government accepted the Tripartite Committee's recommendation that "senior management staff and certain core management personnel could not be represented. These included those involved in hiring, firing, promotion, dismissals and disciplinary duties; those with access to confidential information, such as payroll and budgeting information; those who represent employers' interest in union-management matters and those whose union affiliation would give rise to conflict of interest."
To ensure the Labour Movement and tripartism stay relevant, inclusive and representative of the workforce, we want to confirm that for every organisation, this is but a small, core group only and does not extend too far downwards. This is particularly so as with flatter organisations and matrix reporting, many employees these days become indirectly involved in supervising and appraising staff at all levels. We should aim to cut off the top and senior management only and not all other managers and executives or else this change will not be impactful and progressive.
I am glad to note that the tripartite guidelines state that employers and unions may mutually agree to use proportion of executives in the company and salary as proxies, to determine eligibility for collective representation. More importantly, company structures and staff composition vary and so we urge employers and companies to be pro-active, open and enlightened in approaching the implementation of this set of changes.
By the same token, Section 30A(2)(b) further states "performs or exercises any function, duty or power which includes decision-making, or the power to substantially influence decision-making, on any industrial matters including the employment, termination of employment, promotion, transfer, reward or discipline of other employees". We would want confirmation from the Minister that this excludes mid-level PMEs who have some supervisory functions and give input for appraisals, hiring, firing, etc, such that they too can be represented.
I also seek clarity on the final category under Section 30A(2)(e) – "performs or exercises any other function, duty or power which may give rise to a real or potential conflict of interest if he is represented by the trade union". I wish to ask Minister how far this extends. Could we have some examples of what it is meant to cover?
In the area of recognition of a trade union to represent PMEs, I also ask Minister to confirm that the union only needs to seek recognition for the new grades of executives that it seeks to represent collectively, and that this is separate from and does not affect the recognition already obtained for the rank-and-file employees as such.
Across our affiliated unions, we have started outreach to PMEs and I am very glad to share that many of our senior and top management have joined us as union members to enjoy our full range of PME benefits, short of collective representation. We continue to organise and recruit senior and top management as union members and I am glad our tripartite partners support that. Mr Deputy Speaker, in Mandarin.
: In Singapore, the number of Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) makes up one-third of the workforce. Going forward, this percentage will continue to rise.
The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill will bring about three main benefits:
First, the Bill will enlarge the scope of union representation to allow more PMEs to have collective representation and more bargaining power; Second, limited representation will include re-employment issues which will provide better protection to the older PMEs; Third, the Amendment will make the Industrial Relations Act more inclusive and it is a very proactive and delightful development by bringing more PMEs within the tripartite framework.
I have three wishes. First, I urge employers to support unions in their extension of the scope of representation; second, I hope that more PMEs can join the union as a member, so as to enjoy better protection and benefits; third, I hope Singapore's unique tripartite relationship would continue to strengthen, and be ready to adapt to future changes of the workforce and the workplace.
In conclusion, I applaud this set of amendments to the IR Act and thank our tripartite partners for their support. I look forward to our affiliated unions and unionised branches enlarging their scope of representation and bringing even more PME members within their membership.
In our journey towards staying relevant and outreaching and advocating for PMEs, we in NTUC and the Labour Movement will continue our endeavour and efforts in representing the rank-and-file as they continue to be the lifeline of our workforce. In fact, with this set of amendments, the current dichotomy between the rank-and-file and PMEs will become increasingly irrelevant as we aim to serve all collars of workers.
I urge and encourage all employers to support unions in their extension of scope of representation and help ensure PMEs are brought within tripartism through union representation and support. This will also further enhance our labour-management relations and build a workforce which is represented, motivated, productive, future-ready and future-proofed.
I call for PMEs in Singapore to embrace and take full advantage of this change by joining as union members and becoming a part of the labour movement of Singapore. I strongly support this Bill. Thank you.
:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act. History has shown that strong, responsible unions are essential to industrial fair play. Without unions, industrial relations could be wholly one-sided. The unions in Singapore have played a critical role to set the standards across the board in wages, employment benefits and working conditions. It is said, "If you are making a decent salary in a non-unionised company, you owe it to the unions. One thing that corporations do not do is to give out money out of the goodness of their hearts".
Given the changing profile of our workforce, the PMEs today will be the rank-and-file workers of tomorrow. The proposed amendments will allow the unions to remain relevant. With an increasing number of PMEs, the future direction for the Labour Movement is to get them organised and their union rights recognised by their employers as a condition precedent to creating a fairer workplace environment.
Mr Deputy Speaker, this amendment will allow the unions to give the PMEs a greater level of protection over their workplace rights. In the past, it was assumed that PMEs have the financial capability to engage their own lawyers for any employment matter disputes but the reality is that many junior PMEs may not have the financial ability to undertake their own legal recourse, leaving them in a very vulnerable position. The ability for unions to represent PMEs will create a workplace environment that promotes greater transparency and fairness to resolve employment related disputes.
Let me share the experience of my union, Building Construction and Timber Employees Union (BATU), with one of our unionised companies. The Company underwent a major renovation. BATU had worked closely with the management on the deployment and transfer of the employees, many of whom were our union members. The management also allowed the union to negotiate on behalf of the junior PMEs as well probably because many of them were our union members and there was no concern on conflict of interest.
While management exercised flexibility in this area, however, on matters related to annual increment (AI) and variable bonus (VB), the management went by the book and stated that the settlement for AI and VB was only applicable to the rank and file covered by the Collective Agreement. Half of our junior PME union members were affected. The PMEs in different departments were given different quantum of payment. Needless to say, workers' morale was affected. With the proposed amendments, hopefully we would see less of such cases and improve the quality of workplace treatment that is fair to workers and issue on probable conflict of interest could be better managed.
The amendments would also allow the unions to have a bigger pool of capable members, including PMEs that the union could tap on to enhance union leadership. In BATU, we had experienced a situation where one of our key branch officials was asked to step down from the union committee after he was promoted to a junior manager. He could only be a union member even though the members wanted him to continue as a union leader. Even though he had no real managerial or executive responsibility, and could have continued serving in the union committee without any conflict of interest, the management was resolute in their refusal to allow him to continue in his capacity as a union leader.
Mr Deputy Speaker, there are potential PMEs who are union members that could provide strong leadership to the union. While I understand management's concerns with regards to allowing PMEs to join rank-and-file unions because of possible conflict of interests, however, allowing PMEs to be union leaders can promote a harmonious workplace environment between PMEs and the rank-and-file workers.
In one of our unionised company, the branch chairman was a PME and he was not covered under the collective agreement (CA) but the management allowed him to continue to be the branch official. As the branch chairman, he negotiated on the CA and AI for the rank-and-file workers, and attended to their workplace grievances in the company as well. In this case, our PME union official was very clear on what would be good for the management and what would fair to the workers. He was able to achieve a win-win outcome for both parties and hence, helped to maintain harmonious labour-management relationship. With the proposed amendments, I foresee that unions would benefit on having greater clarity on the PMEs that could be roped in to be part of the union leadership.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the proposed amendments would also promote greater ease and efficiency for unions and management during CA negotiations. In one of our unionised companies, the management allowed for the unions to represent the rank-and-file workers and junior PMEs as well, but insisted on separate CAs to minimise any potential conflict of interest. Even though BATU suggested to work towards one CA as many of the PMEs have no managerial or executive responsibilities and were earning below $4,500, we faced strong objections from the management. The merger could have benefited all parties in terms of common negotiation and allow for more fruitful negotiation, but the "no consent" by the management stalled the efforts for a combined CA. With the proposed amendment, we expect the above obstacles to disappear and the grey area on PME eligibility for union representation to diminish.
While I support the proposed amendments, I would like to suggest that MOM reconsider the guidelines on excluding salaried staff that have access to confidential information such as budget and finances of the company, or the salaried and personal records of other rank-and-file employees. There are instances where the staff are often tasked with mere processing and the nature of the job is mostly administrative. As such, they may stand to lose out more from being excluded from the CA, especially so as they may not be earning much to begin with. While I understand the concerns of including such staff, we should try to push to include rather than exclude as many as possible. Mr Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please.
: The amendment to the Industrial Relations Act will allow more PMEs to be represented by the unions during the collective agreement negotiations as well as in the prevention and resolution of disputes at the workplace.
Among the amendments proposed to the Industrial Relations Act is for the unions to represent PMEs in issues related to re-employment practices. Presently, many workers, including those who are PMEs, are still healthy and wish to continue working. With this amendment, if employers do not allow a PME who is a union member, to continue working when the worker reaches 62 years old, the union can initiate discussions with the employer to ensure that the justification or compensation given is reasonable.
The profile of our labour force is changing. While rank-and-file workers have been the backbone of the Labour Movement, the rising numbers of PMEs is a force to be reckoned with. To be free, employees must be given a choice regardless whether they are rank-and-file workers or PMEs. To have choice, they must retain in their own hands the rights to union representation and be part of the union family. I support the Amendment Bill.
:  Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill. I do wish to highlight my interest as I am also the Managing Director of an MNC operating in Singapore.
PMEs make up more than 30% of the workforce in Singapore and employment of PMEs is growing faster than that of non-PMEs. Based on the latest Labour Force Report in Singapore 2013, the profile of PMEs reflect the higher educational profile of PMEs and the median age of PMEs is 41 years of age with professionals at the youngest at 37 years. With the growing proportion of PMEs in the workforce, it is, therefore, important that there be consideration given to how the interest of this group of employees is to be represented.
To address concerns of conflict of interest and the undermining of management effectiveness by employers, currently only executive unions can represent employees in managerial and executive positions on a collective basis. The Amendment Bill to the Industrial Relations Bill is recommending that constraints for collective representation for executive employees by the rank-and-file (R&F) unions be removed.
To prevent conflict of interest, I support the recommendations in the Amendment Bill to exclude from collective representation by rank-and-file unions, executive employees with specific roles and responsibilities. These include: executive employees in Senior Management positions who have substantial decision making role on industrial matters – someone who represents the employer in Industrial negotiations; executive employees that have access to confidential, budget and financial information including HR data; roles which perform or exercise any function or duty of power that may give rise to conflict of interest if they were represented by the trade unions. These are real conflict of interests as they impact policies, they impact decision making in an organisation and it does undermine the effective operations of the organisation.
Sir, we will all agree that PMEs are a heterogeneous group and have varied interests. I am recommending that guidance to employers on benefits for collective representation need to be considered at the company or the firm level rather than across an industry or job roles. PMEs have varied job scopes and responsibilities. Therefore, to try to classify collective representation of PMEs within an industry would be difficult. To do it by job title may also not be viable. This is especially the case for global companies as their HR policies and benefits are determined at a global level while taking into consideration the local laws in the country of operations.
The Tripartite Guidelines on Expanding the Scope of Limited Representation for Executives, which was released on the 26 November 2014, indicates that apart from using specific responsibilities, Unions and Employers may agree to adopt salary level as a proxy to determine eligibility. I suggest that rather than focusing on how much PMEs are paid, as responsibilities may be very different, it may be more appropriate to look at other factors or concerns impacting the role. For example, the hours of work, work flexibility and performance. Employers and unions should ensure that there is a framework of performance for employees and how performance is assessed. With regard to employee performance, to ensure that executive employee's interest are considered, employers need to have a clear process for performance feedback and management for executive employees. Feedback on performance must also be given to executive employees in advance and not only at the point of notification for dismissal.
While the Tripartite Guidelines indicates that the rank-and-file unions may represent its executive members individually for dismissal without cause and excuse, employers should still have the right to terminate for compliance, misconduct and poor business outlook and prospects.
The recommendation of the tripartite partners also indicates the expansion of the scope of limited individual representation for executive employees to include re-employment benefits. Given the profile and growing proportion of PMEs in the workforce, the question I am asking is, should re-employment be included for collective representation? Should unions and employers be negotiating a framework whereby the conditions or considerations for re-employment be outlined for PMEs? This may then minimise disputes regarding re-employment for executive employees.
I do want to, however, sound a note of caution. While it is important to take care of the interest of PMEs as they are a growing population of the workforce, the concerns of employers with regards to management effectiveness being undermined with increased union representation of executive employees cannot be ignored as this will impact decision for placing operations in Singapore and ultimately jobs.
The Act does try to address some of these concerns by outlining the scope of union representation by excluding executive employees with specific responsibilities as outlined earlier. The Tripartite Guidelines do supplement this by clarifying participation of executive employees in industrial actions. Taken together, there is some clarity to employers on the scope of representation as well as the participation in industrial actions for executive employees.
For management effectiveness, the amendment to the Industrial Relations Act does make it not an offence for employers to require as a condition of appointment or promotion of an executive employee with the specific responsibilities outlined, that the individual is not permitted to assume office or be a member of the rank-and-file union.
I do ask that once the Bill has been passed, that it is important that the Tripartite Panel considers putting in place timeframes for the dispute resolution process. This will ensure that executive employees concerns are dealt with expeditiously and with efficiency. In addition to building timeframes for efficient resolution dispute, I suggest that the panel considers the dispute mechanism so as to find the most effective way to resolve employee and employer concerns. As discussed earlier, the concerns of PMEs are varied and complex and trying to classify concerns by PME roles or across an industry may not be feasible. The recommendation is that concerns be taken at a company level.
Ultimately, for the amendments to be effective, the Unions will have to convince both PMEs, as well as employers, of the benefits of increased representation. Sir, with the above considerations, I support the Bill.
:  Deputy Speaker Sir. Today, the lines between rank-and-file workers and professionals, managers and executives (PMEs) are blurring. I am not referring to inflated job titles but indeed, the scope of work of a blue-collar worker versus that of a white-collar worker is no longer as clearly defined as before. In some cases, the way workers are categorised into PMEs or rank-and-file by firms may not truly reflect the actual work done or responsibility held.
In current context, the work of a worker may change or be enhanced or expanded over his employment term. He or she may also be given greater autonomy to execute more important tasks. Many rank-and-file workers have also upgraded their skills and progressed to more senior positions and hold greater responsibilities.
The Industrial Relations Bill amendments in 2002 allowed for limited representation for executives by a rank-and-file trade union. This latest amendment to the Bill is a timely one. As indicated by several other speakers earlier, the statistics are showing that the demographics of the Singapore's workforce are changing very quickly. More than one in three employees is a PME today and we will expect to see by 2030, two in three being PMEs at the workforce.
Today, the current workforce is made up of different groups of workers. Some within the existing group of rank-and-file workers are moving up the ranks, with better skills acquired and experience accumulated and educational qualifications obtained over the years. There are also increasingly more new entrants to the workforce who have tertiary education.
I would like to declare my position as the Executive Secretary of the Education Services Union (ESU) who today represents five out of every eight private education workers. Of those members that we represent, more than half have tertiary qualifications. Being knowledge-based workers, the private education sector is one whereby we expect to see more PMEs joining this particular workforce. Within the rank-and-file category, we also know of many union members who have upgraded and advanced in their careers. And to this end, I also represent the Singapore Shell Employees' Union (SSEU) and many workers there share the same trend. The revisions to this Bill are, therefore, timely and responsive to their needs.
Many workplace issues faced by our junior or mid-level PMEs are no different from those experienced by rank-and-file workers. In our experience, we have encountered several who have got workplace grievances, such as disputes over employment terms or retrenchment issues in his or her course of work.
According to the Ministry of Manpower's Labour Market report for the third quarter of 2014, PMEs made up two in three of the residents who were laid off. Over at the NTUC Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability, we see more PMEs seeking career coaching and placement help. This was previously mostly serving our rank-and-file workers but more and more PMEs are requiring assistance at the workplace.
Under existing laws, unions can assist PMEs individually in areas of retrenchment, unfair dismissal, breach of contract and victimisation. The amendments to the Bill will allow the union to represent our PMEs as a group by our rank-and-file unions and also to be able to individually represent them, if they face re-employment issues.
The amendments to this Bill not only set up a useful framework but also guide the tripartite partners to work out the terms of reference, the working mechanism, the facts to be surfaced in terms of disputes and areas where the stakeholders will have to do more work rather than just depending on the Bill to set up all the required efforts to be done.
For the amendments to work effectively, we have to go back to the basics. In Singapore, we have strong fundamentals that are built on tripartism. The tripartite partners – Government, employers and the trade unions - have established trust and forged close working relationships over the years. We share a common vision to achieve continued sustainable growth and a better quality of life at the workplace for our workers.
Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our strong tripartism ensures that implementing and educating stakeholders on the intent of such amendments will be executed effectively. Together, we have seen through several major initiatives, such as the re-employment policies and managing excess manpower during the last economic crisis in 2009. Our tripartite partners have been able to navigate the changes together, and work out a set of guidelines to aid in the smooth implementation of any challenges and new policies that will benefit the workplace.
In my experience, some employers have shared that they are worried about how the new amendments may constrain their business operations. One way to addressing their concern is to ensure that they have a clear and good understanding of what the amendment to the Bill serves to do, to look at the spirit of the law and to work with the tripartite partners to ensure that their line supervisors, their HR and their senior management understand this particular amendment.
Employers can also work together with the unions to develop and enhance their existing employment contract and terms. With fairer and more reasonable contract and better workplace practices, this will bring about a higher level of trust and transparency between the employer and employee, whether they are rank-and-file or PMEs. In this way, I believe that companies will continue to thrive because they can engage their PME staff better or work through issues together in a harmonious manner.
It is imperative that we continue to work together as unions, employers and the Government, to expand the areas where we can better look after the needs of our workers. In supporting this Bill, I believe the tripartite partners will demonstrate the resolve to move positively in the right direction and strengthen our collective competitiveness. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with that, I support the amendments to the Bill.
Thank you, Sr. According to Singapore Workforce 2014 by MOM, the number of resident PMEs has increased by an average of 4% per annum over the past 10 years. Today, PMEs comprise about 31% of the workforce and this number is expected to continue to grow. With the growing proportion of PMEs in the workforce, amendments made to this Bill to provide better protection for more workers is thus welcomed.
I have two clarifications on the Bill.
The first one, according to section 17, sub-section (3), there is limited representation for executive employees. This could possibly include employees who are in junior or mid- level management, with job functions that includes managing, directing, legal, human resource and finance.
What could these employees do when they want to seek redress?
Given that employees in Singapore could be multi-tasking within the company; this could lead to many employees having limited representation under this Act. This could also lead to contractual manipulation by employers to restrict their employees' rights. What can be done to prevent this?
In addition, is there any person or class of persons which the gazette had declared not to be employees for the purpose of this Act?
For class of persons with limited representation under the Act, should their occupation be stated explicitly in the gazette or the Act itself to avoid confusion and surprises? What can the Ministry do to help employees make an informed choice when accepting a job offer or taking on additional job scope? What does the Ministry intends to do to generate more awareness among employees about this Act, especially those with limited representation?
Next, this Act also excludes trade unions which have not been given recognition by an employer to act on behalf of employees. In order to know if there is adequate representation, how many trade unions have applied to be accorded recognition by employers and how many have successfully done so?
In conclusion, I look forward to the Minister's clarifications on the points raised.

: I thank the Deputy Speaker for the opportunity given to me to take part in this debate. I am glad and honoured to speak and share my thoughts on this important issue which is close to my heart, and the hearts of my fellow unionists in the Labour Movement.
Sir, every job has its own professionalism, and not many colleges and universities teach about running a Union and the closest is the Human Resource Management (HRM) course taught in UniSIM. Many rank-and-file union leaders have pursued their career in HRM and even have gone further to foreign universities to master this subject. Indeed, Sir, this job requires passion more than knowledge.
With the changing demography in many parts of the world, developed and developing nations are seeing more executives and managers in their workforce. Singapore is not spared either. Our statistics shows there are more professionals, managers and executives in the workforce. When faced with a dilemma in a legal issue, people approach a lawyer. Similarly, employees in whatever position they are in the company want assistance on work-related issues they also want a professional to handle their grievances.
The union leadership covering the majority of the workforce will be relevant in solving issues and managers and executives can provide leadership to the Labour Movement. With this amendment to the IR Act, many stand to benefit the coverage of the union, and many are now deprived of that. To my knowledge, there are companies who provide benefits below the Employment Act for those beyond the coverage.
Sir, unions were representing about 80% of the workforce in the past, with this new amendment, unions will be representing close to the past percentage. With the influx of professionals, managers and executives, the rank-and-file members will stand to benefit with their expertise.
Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to-date, many PMEs are not informed of the reason for their retrenchment, termination and dismissal. With these changes in the law, they will be covered for re-employment in addition to the four areas in the past. This is most welcome by the PMEs and the Labour Movement.
As Singaporeans aspire to study further and start their working lives as PMEs, they will heave a sigh of relief that our law will look after them in the most important aspect of their careers. They also know that they can seek help from a professional unionist when the need arises.
Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I commend the good efforts of the Ministry. Our challenge now is to work together as tripartite partners to change the mindset on the ground. I am encouraged that the public sector will lead by example. The rest of us should not wait. We all can play our part. Let us all change together.
This amendment portrays a strong tripartism which many nations are envious of. Sir, I support the Bill.
:  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join this debate. Sir, since 2010, the Government has made tremendous efforts to rationalise the structure of the labour force to ensure that it is placed on a more sustainable footing. The move away from excessive reliance on foreign manpower has been at the centre of such efforts. I have been particularly heartened by the Government's decision to take the hard choice of keeping to a consistent line on the gradual pace of increasing foreign manpower levies. I have no doubt that such a policy will stand us in good stead in the long run.
Limiting the growth of foreign manpower has been a necessary if difficult move, but will not by itself be sufficient to produce the transformation of the labour force we need as rapidly as we would like.
Sir, the transformation can be quickened by creating a more conducive climate for change as well as deepening the extent to which labour market participants can involve themselves in that change.
Hence, apart from just focusing on foreign manpower limitations, the Government has also worked on other fronts, including encouraging increased labour force participation of older workers and women, promoting continuing education and training, and emphasising the deepening of skills before the pursuit of qualifications.
In 2012, in recognition of the ageing of our workforce, a new re-employment law was introduced.
Sir, the current Bill before us takes account of the changing profile of the labour force, and is another important policy response that will enable the Singapore workforce to meet its challenges in bridging that gap in transformation.
Contrary to the view that we should reduce or slow the curbs on foreign manpower, I believe what we should do is to accelerate the pace of the adjustments at all levels so that the ultimate objective of a more sustainable, productivity-enhancing, model of labour force growth can be achieved sooner.
Advancing the activism of labour unions in these areas of change can help to propel the labour force towards that goal faster. This is how I interpret the implications of the amendments in this Bill. Singapore's record of industrial harmony has been a key pillar of its success, and is another debt we owe the pioneer generation who built this nation of ours. The harder that workers of our pioneer generation toiled, the more self-effacing they were, and the quieter they remained about their achievements.
In the next phase of our nation building, workers will continue to be a key factor. Hence, it is important for labour unions to remain as representative as possible in the face of changes in the profile of the labour force.
Although increased union activity could increase costs for employers, such activity need not be always be an impediment. As disruptive technologies pose a huge challenge to workers as well as their employers, responsible unions can instead drive change in the right direction. In order to nurture a resilient and sophisticated workforce in response, the union movement can play an important role through its membership base to effect change in areas such as workforce upgrading as well as improvement in work processes.
Apart from collective bargaining, this Bill expands rank-and-file union representation of individual executive employees to disputes in re-employment. This is an important new step, building on the labour market flexibility that resulted from the introduction of the Retirement and Re-employment Act of 2012.
Sir, this Bill is an important demonstration of the continuing policy responsiveness of this Government in labour market matters. It sees to the changing needs of workers as a result of evolving conditions in our labour market.
I have only one question about this Bill. I would like to know why the Bill makes such a limited expansion in the number of areas where rank-and-file unions are allowed to represent executive employees. There are other areas where allowing such representation would be useful. Just as re-employment is a growing area of concern for an economy with an ageing population and a limited indigenous labour force, fair competition for jobs is also important. At the moment, such matters come under TAFEP. I would argue that labour unions should be allowed to represent executive employees in hiring disputes. Labour unions are well-placed to move beyond the emotive aspects of such disputes and to engage constructively with employers to understand the situation from the employers' perspective. For a country which has been reliant on and benefitting from foreign manpower for as long as we can remember, this is not a trivial issue and adding a union perspective in dealing with hiring disputes will be an important addition.
By availing union representation to executive employees in hiring disputes, local workers will be given deeper assurance of the protection they can depend on, while unions will gain a broader understanding of the true state of the level and type of competition local workers face and, hence, be equipped to conduct more effective advocacy on their behalf against actual hiring biases. Ultimately, beyond approaching the issue from an adversarial perspective, more can be done to deepen our understanding about the trade-off between labour market diversity and nurturing of local talent that enter into every employer's hiring consideration. Given the fact that the openness of the labour market has been an important contributor to our economic development, it would be important for the union movement to play an active and responsible role in preserving the delicate balance in hiring that is key to that openness.
Beyond hiring disputes, there are other areas which concern executive employees that would ultimately impact the development of the local workforce. In general, I believe, it is useful to see the Bill in a larger context.
Sir, throughout the world, labour unions are transforming, moving beyond confrontation and seeking to re-position themselves to address contemporary issues such as international competition. With a broader scope of representation, unions can take the initiative to approach employers and explore concerns about issues such as job matches and a workplace that is more conducive to productivity.
In conclusion, I believe that the importance of the Amendment Bill is that it recognises that changes in the labour market should be supported by a more responsive framework in the laws governing labour union representation. Without the support of an up-to-date legal framework, workers will feel unrepresented and unions risk becoming irrelevant.
In this day and age, most union leaders, especially in Singapore, understand that it is better to increase the value of workers to employers as a means of getting a better deal. They understand that calls for pay increases that are unsupported by improved performance could simply translate into lower employment.
For this reason, I urge the Government to continue to explore expansion of areas in which rank-and-file unions can represent executive employees and to consider ways to strengthen the capacity of responsible unions in engaging employers. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.
:  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill was proposed to allow PMEs to participate in collective agreements. I am heartened to know that the recommendations by the tripartite workgroup are generally well-received on the ground and the Ministry is taking proactive steps to extend collective representation to PMEs, who, in the past, had limited access to union representation.
A resident of mine wrote to me, who is working as a PME for a local company, telling me that he had a dispute with his former employer. According to him, his former employer did not pay him his salary, did not contribute to his CPF, and did not reimburse him for his petty case expenses. He made a complaint to MOM. MOM, after investigation, ordered his former employer to reimburse him his salary, CPF contributions, and petty cash expenses in full. His former employer is currently disputing MOM's order at the High Court and the resident now has actually spend thousands of dollars to engage a lawyer to file the claim against his former employer.
The union will not able to help now without the amendment to this new Bill. PMEs like him who in the past could only seek recourse for their grievances with costly legal bill will, now, hopefully, with this new amendment will be able to have an additional avenue to address their industrial disputes.
The amendment to the Bill is also a first important step towards extending collective representation to those who needed it but were denied of it because of the nature of their job. I therefore hope that the Ministry can also consider extending the range of the collective representation to eventually allow unions to represent PMEs in industrial disputes that are currently excluded from this amendment. It was reported recently that MOM has taken actions against a maritime firm for discriminatory treatment of Singaporeans. In that particular incident, MOM's investigation uncovered that 13 Singaporeans were retrenched as a group with unfounded justifications. Although PMEs can seek recourse and resolution for such incidents through the Employment Act and Fair Consideration Framework, I am of the opinion that it is also useful for unions to be also able to represent PMEs in such cases.
Nowadays, we also begin to hear more anecdotal stories of PMEs on how their senior colleagues have been retrenched because it is less costly to employ someone younger or to hire a foreign PME. Although PMEs who are unjustly dismissed could approach MOM for assistance, the unions can act as first line of support to protect deserving PMEs from unfair dismissal through dialogues with employers and negotiations. Dialogues between union representatives and management could possibly prevent such unfair dismissals from happening and escalating to a level where the Ministry has to step in to take punitive actions against the company.
Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, allow me to continue in Mandarin.
: Deputy Speaker, Sir, this amendment Bill will allow the industrial relations in Singapore to be further enhanced. This is a win-win solution arising from the participation of and discussion between various parties. This new amendment Bill will help PMEs who are involved in labour disputes or face unfair treatment to have a convenient and effective way of resolving their disputes. More importantly, by becoming a union member, PMEs can be represented by the union and their interests be fought for. The collaboration spirit of Singapore's harmonious industrial relations will be enhanced, which will help to prevent future industrial disputes. The core team of a company can work together under a harmonious industrial relationship, much to the benefits of the company's development.
Because of this, I hope that MOM can ensure that all the employers understand and support this Bill, particularly the SMEs. The SMEs are now facing all sorts of problems; they may mistakenly believe that this is another legal requirement which could cause difficulty to them. MOM should explain to them that this is not to give them more troubles; instead, this is a new incentive and framework to help them develop.
It is necessary for MOM to introduce support packages and communication plans to encourage SMEs to understand and adopt this new industrial relations framework.
MOM should also strengthen cooperation with SCCCI and other chambers of commerce to help SMEs understand this Bill and the two tripartite guidelines.
Let the Government and the enterprises work together; let everyone in the whole company worker together to bring Singapore enterprises to a new height.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.
:  Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill. I wish to declare that I work in the NTUC and am involved in the running of a number of unions.
Today, I wish to speak on two aspects of this Bill. First, I want to discuss how this Bill will impact Singapore's attractiveness to investment and to good jobs. Second, I want to give my explanation as to why I think it is right and timely to include Re-employment matters into the scope for limited individual representation.
First, my comments on these amendments and the Bill on Singapore's attractiveness to investments and good jobs.
Sir, when Singapore was a much cheaper location to base investments in, we could use factor cost advantages compared to the more developed countries in order to attract the companies to come here and put their investments here and to expand their operations over here. That relative cost advantage, together with a hardworking and fast-learning workforce, allowed Singapore to make up for what we lacked at that point in skills, in capabilities and market to some extent.
In addition to these factor costs, Singapore also offers what I would termed "systems-level attractiveness". And by this I mean, in particular, the ease of doing business, zero tolerance for corruption that enable a transparency of costs to businesses, predictability of Government policies over a longer horizon, and industrial peace through tripartism.
Businesses know that these systems-level considerations are not trivial when they compare country with country, city with city, in deciding where and when to site, to expand or move their investments and operations. They decide based on the composite assessment of cost plus these other systems advantages. They know that, Singapore knows that as well.
Over time, costs in Singapore have risen. Whether we look at land, labour or utility – over the longer period – they have risen. And it is fair to say that we are no longer considered a low-cost investment location.
Since it is clearly becoming harder for Singapore to compete purely on factor cost, it means that Singapore must focus on two key areas in order to maintain our attractiveness to good investments and the good jobs that they bring. We must improve productivity and continue to climb the value-added ladder in order to offset the cost impact directly. We must also ensure that our systems-level advantages are continually safeguarded and enhanced to help keep up our total attractiveness.
Sir, today's amendment of the Industrial Relations Act, in my view, comes under strengthening this second thrust of safeguarding our systems-level advantages through enabling the continuation of industrial peace.
How is industrial peace achieved and how is it maintained? Some people may think that maybe industrial peace can be legislated, for example, if you make a law to outlaw strikes and work stoppages. This clearly is a naive view. Believing this would be like believing that you can keep the pressure in just by keeping the lid on. You do it this way and in the end what you get is really a pressure cooker bomb.
Some others may think that industrial peace maybe can still be legislated, and this time you find another law, perhaps the Employment Act, and then you put all the terms under that and you guarantee that. In my view, that would be an impractical view because what the Employment Act can do is to specify minimum standards for all companies and industries; in other words, every business that operates in Singapore. It will not be able to be all things to all kinds of employees, companies and situations. So, if you were to rely on the Employment Act alone, I think you will tend to gravitate to the lowest common denominator and, in fact, create and suffer a high degree of rigidity.
The Industrial Relations Act, therefore, offers a viable way forward. Building upon the requirements of the Employment Act, it allows companies and their unions to work together flexibly for win-win outcomes that benefit both shareholders and employees. It allows for the customisation of arrangements that best address the needs and concerns of the stakeholders at the enterprise level.
Some employers may hold the view that allowing unions to represent their workers in industrial relations will reduce their degrees of management freedom, and feel that, really, if it was not possible to not have unions, then it might be better to limit the role of the unions as much as possible. While I can understand this point of view, especially if these businesses have had prior negative experiences elsewhere in the world, it is not the situation here in Singapore.
This brings me to a key point. I think amending the Industrial Relations Act in a manner proposed is an absolutely necessary step. However, I also wish to say that the effectiveness and value of the Industrial Relations Act in operation depends critically on the effectiveness of tripartism because it is tripartism that gives Singapore's industrial relations its spirit.
How can we then describe this Singaporean spirit of tripartism? Tripartism in Singapore has been painstakingly fostered, tested and strengthened over the past four to five decades – through good times and crises – to manifest that collaborative and forward-looking essence. It is both pro-business and pro-worker at the same time, and it can adapt dynamically as companies, industries and the economy go through ups and downs. The deep mutual trust nurtured among the three parties to this relationship is both a lubricant and a safety catch. This is not theory that I am talking about. This is a proven fact here in Singapore over many years.
So, the core question is this: would allowing general unions or rank-and-file unions to also represent managerial and executive members, subject to the exclusions for conflict of interests, be more likely to crimp management and make running businesses harder, or more likely to bring the fast-growing number of PMEs within the benign and I would say even benevolent coverage and care of Singapore's proven win-win tripartism, thus reinforcing the prospects for continued industrial peace and attractiveness to investments?
To me, the historical evidence over these past decades is so clear – inclusion within tripartism is the wiser choice for all.
The alternative to this would be to deal with challenges in industrial matters on an
ad hoc a
nd scattered basis, making such handling not only more complicated for companies but also beyond the ability of tripartism to help should things go haywire.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I move on to my second aspect which is on the inclusion of re-employment. We all know that the Retirement Age Act was amended in January 2011 to include re-employment as a general statutory obligation on employers when their workers reach 62 years of age, and that law took effect from January 2012.
It is common knowledge that the labour market is very tight, and many companies face genuine difficulties in meeting their manpower needs. This tightness is forecasted to continue.
Re-employed manpower is not only a good source of headcount, but also of experience and networks. At the same time, mature workers reaching the statutory retirement age want to have the chance and choice of continuing to contribute and earn income.
Under the re-employment law, individual workers who feel that they have not been fairly treated by their employers can take up the matter themselves with the Ministry of Manpower, and there is a conciliation and arbitration mechanism in place to deal with such complaints.
Rank-and-file workers may already be represented by their unions, if they are members, for re-employment issues. As for managers and executives who are members of rank-and-file unions, they cannot at this point be represented by their rank-and-file unions for re-employment issues as only four categories have been legislated for such individual limited representation, namely, retrenchment; unfair dismissal; victimisation; and breach of contract.
Therefore, as the ranks of the PMEs swell, and as more baby boomers reach retirement age in the coming years, we should be proactive in working out viable systems arrangements within the tripartite framework to handle this important area promptly and with fairness.
The proposed amendment to include re-employment as a fifth category under the limited representation is, therefore, both timely and prudent.
Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore has to find ways to maintain our attractiveness to investments and business so that our citizens can make a better living and have good prospects. The world is a volatile, uncertain and complex one. Our own demography and workforce structures are changing. In the midst of all these, we must devise arrangements to maintain fairness, stability and advantage so that our people's future will continue to be hopeful.
These amendments to the Industrial Relations Act will help us move in that direction. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.
:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Zainal Sapari, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Ang Hin Kee, Ms Lee Li Lian, Mr K Karthikeyan, Assoc Prof Randolph Tan, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Heng Chee How for their views and support for the proposed changes to the Industrial Relations Act.
Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Lee Li Lian sought clarification on the five grounds of exclusion from collective representation with regard to the extent to which the exclusions will kick in and cases where union affiliation could give rise to conflict of interest. Mr Zainal Sapari suggested not excluding from collective representation salaried workers who merely process confidential information and who do not hold senior positions in their companies.
Mr Deputy Speaker, tripartite partners have carefully considered the criteria to determine eligibility for collective representation, and consciously decided not to be overly prescriptive. In determining the classes of employees to be represented, it is important to preserve flexibility for employers and unions in their negotiations. As the proposed amendments are meant to allow executives greater access to union representation, the exclusions are generally not meant to apply to junior executives. Furthermore, employees who are tasked with mere processing of confidential information would generally not be executives, and hence are not included in the scope of this Bill.
The specific executives or classes of executives who are eligible to be represented will ultimately depend on the circumstances and structures of the organisations. Employers and unions should work closely in the spirit of cooperation to reach an agreement on the issue of eligibility.
As I highlighted earlier, we all would generally prefer more prescriptive definitions, we would like clearer parameters, but the world has changed. It is a lot more difficult to define the specific roles for each of these PMEs, as executives. As I have mentioned, in different organisations, you have different structures. In a particular organisation, an executive may hold certain responsibilities. In another, it could be quite different. So, we believe that in the spirit of tripartism, this space afforded both employers and unions would allow the negotiations to take place. We need to learn to embrace that change, and to embrace that space that we have in order for us to carve out what we define as a common space for everyone to move on.
In our consultations on the Bill, employers have raised concerns on the impact on business operations and managerial effectiveness. We have heard Ms Jessica Tan's concerns and this is echoed by many of the companies out there. We understand that. It is important to realise that there are conflicting needs – unions, workers, employees. Employees may prefer much more extensive inclusion, more inclusive approach, whereas companies would have reservations, and both views are valid. Ultimately, we need to find a halfway position not so much directly in the middle, but a formulation that works best for all parties concerned and ultimately benefits all of us here in Singapore.
So, let me first assure the House that the proposed amendments that we are debating today are meant to provide those additional options for employers and unions to consider. Employers and unions can adopt the modality and arrangement that best suits the structure and circumstances of the organisation and the needs of their executives. To address the employers' concerns, we have, as mentioned, taken the approach of allowing flexible implementation on the ground to take into account the differences that exists across industries and organisational circumstances, and, in the consultation, that has come out quite clearly.
In response to requests from employers, tripartite partners have released a set of guidelines ahead of the legislative amendments to help prepare unions and employers early and address concerns that they had about how they should adapt to the proposed amendments. Again, this is the guidelines that are issued by our tripartite partnership, and we have taken on board many of the various views and concerns expressed by many of you here in the House.
Employers have also highlighted in our consultations that the needs of the executives are different from the rank-and-file employees. Executives are a heterogeneous group, with a more individualised pay structure. Their remuneration package includes items such as performance bonus or wage increment which are pegged to their individual performance, rather than being fixed. In addition, the pay structure of the executives in multinational companies is typically determined, as highlighted by Ms Jessica Tan, by the global HR policies that are beyond the shores of Singapore. These conditions make it challenging for us to negotiate for traditional collective agreement items, such as wage increments or bonuses.
Mr Deputy Speaker, as mentioned earlier, we do want to avoid a narrow prescription of the arrangement that unions and employers should have. In fact, that is the wise approach to take in this instance. Both parties should be given the maximum amount of leeway for them to work out an arrangement that best suits the needs of their executives. This round of amendments will broaden the range of options for unions and employers to consider.
For example, tripartite partners noted that granting recognition for collective representation of executives may not necessarily lead to collective agreements. Collective representation should focus on what is of collective interest to the executives. For certain companies and executives whose employment terms and benefits are highly individualised, the union can assist the executives in other areas which may be more important to the executives, such as career and skills development. The outcome will, therefore, be one where unions, executives and employers can all benefit.
Mr Patrick Tay also sought clarification on the union recognition process to represent executives. Unions who have been accorded recognition by the company for rank-and-file employees will have to seek recognition for the new classes of executives that it seeks to represent collectively.
I would like to thank Mr K Karthikeyan, Ms Jessica Tan, Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Mr Heng Chee How for their support for expanding the scope of limited representation to include re-employment disputes.
The Retirement and Re-employment Act (RRA) that came into effect in 2012 covers all employees. This amendment complements the Re-employment Act to allow rank-and-file unions to represent its executive members in negotiations with employers on an individual basis for re-employment matters.
Assoc Prof Randolph Tan also suggested that we further expand the scope of limited representation to represent executives in ensuring fair competition for jobs. These are important concerns for executives and my Ministry has introduced the Fair Consideration Framework in 2013 to address these concerns.
Limited representation for executives, on the other end, largely focuses on end of employment issues, such as dismissal, breach of individual employment contract, retrenchment benefits and re-employment, for which unions can help in resolving disputes for their executive members who have been employees of the organisation. Thus, limited representation is perhaps not quite the right mechanism to deal with the issue of fair competition for jobs. For that area of concern, we have introduced other measures in this House previously.
Ms Lee Li Lian asked what can be done to help the executives who remain excluded by the proposed amendments. She would be pleased to note that the upcoming Employment Claims Tribunal, which I had mentioned earlier, will cover all employees including executives earning above $4,500 and regardless of job responsibilities, and provide them with an expeditious and affordable channel for resolving their various employment disputes, which we know crop up from time to time.
Ms Lee also asked about the number of trade unions that are approved for representing executives for purposes of negotiating with unions. We have received feedback from NTUC that some unions have discussed and worked out agreements with management on the forms of representation for executives. However, we do not have the official statistics as yet.
Since the introduction of the limited representation in 2002, many unions have recruited many executives to join their ranks. This is not a new move. We started this move quite some time ago. We are building on it. Mr Ang Hin Kee and Mr Zainal shared about how their unions have built up over time to serve more executives. I am heartened to hear about the good progress made by the rank-and-file unions, which have benefited many junior executives.
Mr Yeo Guat Kwang spoke about the transition that unions have to go through in response to the changing workforce profile. Rank-and-file workers will remain the core of rank-and-file unions. I would strongly encourage the unions to persevere in reaching out to the executives, so that they can also better serve the needs of this growing group for a more inclusive Labour Movement. And with the proposed amendments, rank-and-file unions can serve the needs of all classes of workers.
This transition is not just for the unions. Government and employers have to evolve as well. I have outlined earlier the slew of initiatives that the Government has rolled out targeting the executives. Employers too need to step up to these changes and work with the unions in addressing the needs of their executives.
To sum up, this Bill will provide additional options for workplace representation of our executives. There will be an additional avenue for executives to seek collective representation. Limited representation will continue to be an option to help executives address their individual disputes at the workplace, including re-employment disputes. I would like to assure Ms Jessica Tan and Members of the House that my Ministry will ensure that disputes arising out of the implementation of the IR Act will be dealt with in an expeditious and efficient manner.
Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill is a culmination of tripartite partners' efforts over more than a decade to make our model of tripartitism more inclusive. It is timely for us to review how we can expand and deepen our tripartite model to benefit rank-and-file employees, as we have done so over the years, as well as to look after the growing number of executives in our workforce.
I would like echo what Mr Heng Chee How shared about the industrial relations and the industrial peace that we have enjoyed, how important that has been for all our well-being. It is not something we should take for granted. We often do take it for granted in Singapore. In fact, we would be hard pressed to find the occasions where these conflicts come to a head, but it is common in many other countries. It affects investors' confidence as highlighted by Mr Heng Chee How, there are many different factors that investors look at when they consider moving to a particular country.
Indeed, compared to the past, we are not as cheap as before. That is simply because we have developed and that is a good thing. But we need to retain the competitive advantage because when companies and other investors are confident in Singapore and they anchor themselves here, they create opportunities for our people and that is important.
Our unique tripartite model has been a key competitive advantage for us in our 50 years of nationhood, and that has enabled companies to invest in Singapore for the long term with confidence. This tripartite partnership where the unions, employers and Government continue to work closely together is not something that we want to take for granted. As the world evolves, as the society evolves, we need to evolve our model of tripartism as well.
With this round of amendments, more disputes can be addressed early at the enterprise level, between unions and management. It will allow management now to bring to the fore PMEs, and for executives to be represented by a partner whom they are familiar with and whom they have had a constructive relationship with over the many years. This will allow and provide avenues to further strengthen the labour-management relationship at the organisational level and allow our model of tripartism to be a continued source of strength for Singapore, ultimately benefiting all Singaporeans.
So, once again, I thank all our stakeholders, including Members of the House, for their suggestions and inputs, for their support of this Bill.
: Do the Members have any further clarifications?
[(proc text) The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. – [
]. (proc text)]
The Chairman
:  "The citation year ‘2014’ will be changed to ‘2015' as indicated in the Order Paper Supplement."
: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That Parliament do now adjourn."
Dr Benedict Tan, you have a maximum of 20 minutes.
:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to declare my interests as the President of the Singapore Sailing Federation and Sports Patron of the Singapore Disability Sports Council.
In my clinic each day, I see lots of students from our local schools, with their parents in tow. At some point during the consultation, the Singaporean parent will ask, "Dr Tan, can you write my son an MC to excuse him from PE and sports? At the same time, can you also ask the school to allow him to use the lift?" You will see a similar dialogue with pre-enlistees or their parents requesting for excuse letters or permanent downgrades. Many doctors will tell you that these are common scenarios.
I see students from our international schools as well, such as the United World College and the Singapore American School. No, it is not the MC that they are after. Rather, they want me to sort out their injuries so that they can continue and finish the baseball season, and be fully fit before the swimming season begins! It is very common for students from the international schools to do multiple sports - with full support from their parents.
When I see such contrasting attitudes, it worries me. I am worried because this is just one manifestation of a systemic disease in Singapore's sports participation framework.
Singaporeans are pragmatic – we are goal oriented and we monitor closely our key performance indicators (KPIs). We pay close attention to what is tangible and measureable, that is, medals and grades. Without fail, before each Major Games, the media will ask me, as President of Singapore Sailing, what is our medal target and whether we are on track.
Do they ever ask me whether our sailors enjoy sailing, whether they are familiar with Singapore's rich maritime history, whether our sailors see sailing as a lifelong pursuit, whether they are inculcated with the desired values, or whether we have sailors who sail for reasons other than medals? I wish they did, because those are the pertinent questions that matter much more than the medals.
I would say that the SNOC, MCCY, and Sport Singapore have done a thorough job of reviewing our High Performance Systems over the years – from the Sports Excellence (SPEX) Programme in the 1990s, to the Committee on Sporting Singapore (CoSS), Project 08/12 Go For Gold and the Olympic Pathway Programme, to the current High Performance Sports (HPS) Programme. Through such comprehensive initiatives, our elite athletes have progressed to the point where we are winning Olympic medals, and last year our sailors won Singapore's first two YOG Golds. On the academic KPI, we have done exceedingly well, topping the IB exams for the fourth consecutive year and achieving the best showing at the "O" levels in 20 years.
What we need to do now is to pay more attention to mass participation, where the results and benefits are less tangible. Yes, we had Sports for Life in the 1990s, and the current Vision2030 master plan adopts a more holistic outlook, and we have introduced ActiveSG. Nevertheless, there appears to be worrying trends emerging in our local sports culture. I highlight 10 of them.
One, Singaporeans are not exercising enough. The 2011 National Sports Participation Survey revealed that only 42% of Singaporeans exercised at least once a week, down from 50% in 2005. Compare this with Finland's enviable 76% in 2005. Participation levels fell amongst Singaporeans below 60 years of age, particularly those in their teens, which fell by 16% to 68%. This does not bode well for our future. On top of that, blue-collared workers recorded a larger decline in sports participation compared to professionals, managers, executives and businessmen (PMEBs).
Two, too many of our young are not enjoying sports. When I ask my patients from the local schools if they look forward to their school's Sports Day, I get a cynical look. When I ask a patient from UWC the same question, she said, "We all love it – it's so much fun!" She continues effusively, "Sports Day is run over three whole days and everybody participates and gets to try multiple sports. There're aquatics, games, and athletics. We are rotated from one station to another, and end up trying a lot of things. You don't need to be good, and it is do-able for everyone!"
When young Singaporeans have a pleasant introduction to sports and physical activity, the exercise habit is likely to continue into adulthood and beyond. We need to review how we approach physical activity promotion across various groups, especially the young. We may have the best-laid policies and plans, but let us see how we can do better in bringing these into fruition.
Three, our motivation for being physically active is questionable. Do we do it because it is simply the natural thing to do, or because it is part of our culture and tradition? Or do we participate in sports to accumulate CCA points or notch a higher level of attainment under the Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation and Service (LEAPS) 2.0 framework; for direct school admission (DSA); or for a shorter BMT?
In our international schools, the norm is to participate in at least one sport. Many participate or compete in multiple sports despite the fact that the international schools do not award CCA points. In fact, do we really treat sports as truly "co"-curricular? In January 2000, MOE acknowledged the integral role of co-curricular activities in achieving the desired outcomes of education by replacing the term extra-curricular with co-curricular. It is work in progress, and I look forward to more and more Singaporean parents – and consequently their children - adopting the right mentality, participating in CCAs for the right reasons.
Four, there are not enough opportunities to learn sports. Again, citing our international schools as an example, there are ample opportunities for their students. For each sport on the comprehensive menu of sports that they offer, there are teams of various levels, including beginners. Another one of my patients from an international school was not much of a basketballer when he enrolled in the school, so he simply joined the novice team. As he got better, he progressed to team C then B, and eventually ended up in team A.
Contrast that with our local schools where parents have told me that if you are not good enough for the school team, you are not offered to a chance to participate in that sport at all. Take sailing for example. In the past, there were multiple entry-points into sailing. It did not matter if you did not start sailing in Primary school, you still had another chance to try out sailing in Secondary school, and if you missed that, there is still the Junior College and Polytechnic. Now, apart from the international schools, hardly any local school in Singapore will offer to teach you sailing. They accept only ready-made sailors.
I find this disappointing because a significant number of national sailors did a credible job of representing Singapore even though they started sailing relatively late. Stanley Tan and Stanley Chan got introduced to sailing through their Junior College. Stanley Tan went on to represent Singapore at two Olympic Games while and Stanley Chan is a multiple Asian and SEA Games representative and medalist. Despite such success stories, their Junior College has since shelved their sailing programme.
If our schools do not undertake to accept new entrants to various sports, there will be no future Stanley Tans or Stanley Chans. An FAS survey of 100 Primary schools earlier this year found that nearly one in two children wanted to play football, but only 5.9% of boys and 1.6% of girls were given a chance to.
Five, are our schools too focused on winning medals, at the expense of sports participation? Even school teams face the threat of being scrapped simply because they can't achieve a podium finish. The 14 December 2014 issue of
The Sunday Times
cited a veteran football coach who said, "My principal said the football team will be scrapped if we don't reach the nationals tournament." Is winning the only thing that matters to our schools? While policies have shifted, how can we help the policy implementers put it right?
Six, Singaporeans are struggling with their fitness levels. A lecturer at one of our Polytechnics estimates that 70% of Poly students fail their NAPFA test. Another lecturer at a different Polytechnic cited a failure rate of 60%-70%. Pre-enlistees struggle to get fit for national service and many NSmen struggle with their IPPT as well. MINDEF's recent simplification of the IPPT format and increased flexibility in the IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) are steps in the right direction, as keeping the status quo will not yield better results.
Seven, reduced fitness levels in turn lead to increased obesity rates and a heavier burden of chronic diseases. Singapore's prevalence of obesity rose from 6.9% in 2004 to 10.8% in 2010 while diabetes rose from 8.2% to 11.3% in the same period.
Eight, our sports events can be more veteran-friendly. One is never too old to participate in sports and there is ample medical evidence that one can benefit from exercise even if one starts late. What message are we sending when Singapore's biggest marathon offers older runners only one age category, that is the above-40 Masters category? Lumping a 60 year-old runner together with a 40 year-old in the same competitive category can only discourage the 60 year-old even before the race has started.
When I was at the International Sailing Federation meeting last November, there was naturally and understandably a lot of emphasis on youth sailing and how to attract young people to the sport. Hence, I was impressed with the insight of a windsurfing official who reminded the meeting that, in fact, the biggest market for windsurfing is actually the older age groups.
Nine, the physically challenged are still facing significant barriers to sports participation. For the disabled, sport offers a beacon of hope and is an important avenue for reintegrating into society. Desmond Tong lost his right leg in a motorcycle accident in 1999. After the accident, his life went into a tailspin, he dropped out of university, was ostracised by his friends, and became depressed and suicidal. Through sports, he has since picked himself up and has been training diligently to do Singapore proud in the archery event of the ASEAN Para Games to be held in Singapore in December this year. His main obstacle now is not his missing leg, but the fact that he does not have a 70-metre range to practice after he finishes work on weekdays. Jason Chee, who lost both legs and his left arm while serving on a Navy ship in 2012, now represents Singapore in table tennis. Together with his doubles partner Darren Chua, he won a bronze medal for Singapore at the ASEAN Para Games last year. Jason is also now training hard for the next ASEAN Para Games. What is his number one obstacle? Jason says, "Transport to and from my training venue."
Dr William Tan, a long-time advocate for challenged athletes, added that apart from permanent training venues and transportation, another major obstacle faced is funding. Dr Tan shared, "The financial support from the existing carding system is meagre for challenged athletes. Any financial support received goes mostly to transportation costs."
Ten, the struggle for recreational space, especially for sports, is escalating. Agencies like NParks, URA, PUB, and SLA have been very progressive in optimising our shared spaces. As a result, we witness water sports in the heart of our CBD in Marina Bay itself, beautiful running tracks along our waterways, recreational activities on various reservoirs, and ciclovia – the closing of a section of Orchard Road to cars one evening a month in favour of pedestrians.
In a highly urbanised Singapore, there will always be challenges when it comes to sharing spaces. Take, for example, the constant struggle between cyclists and other road users or pedestrians. Last November, Eric Khoo, the organiser of the HolyCrit cycling race in Tanglin Halt explained that he did not seek permits from the authorities primarily because an estimated $25,000 to $30,000 in compliance costs that is needed.
The sailing community could not continue its proud tradition of the popular Round Island Race because permits would not be granted. Maritime security and safety are certainly valid concerns, but we need to push the boundaries and take a leaf from others. If other countries were as conservative as us, there would be no Sydney Hobart Race or boating activities in the busy Sydney Harbour or San Francisco Bay.
Each of these points represents a major obstacle to Singaporeans adopting an active lifestyle. Collectively, they form a formidable barrier to sports participation. Each of these issues falls under the purview of a few agencies. This is reminiscent of the fishball stick anecdote that Prime Minister Lee shared at the last National Day Rally. I hope we would not need a sports equivalent of the Municipal Sports Services Office to systematically address these multifaceted challenges. But let us not wait till our obesity levels catch up with the West, or for our healthcare costs to creep further up, or for the pipelines to our national teams to run dry before we strengthen our resolve to address these emerging gaps in Singapore's sports participation. Thank you.
Before I call Minister Lawrence Wong, I just want to let Dr Benedict Tan know that my favourite subject in school was physical education. Minister Lawrence Wong.
:  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Dr Tan for his observations and his suggestions to improve sports participation in Singapore. Dr Tan spoke of several emerging gaps in our sports participation and trends that he had noted of some concern in our sports culture. These were, in fact, surfaced in our extensive conversations when we did our Vision 2013 masterplan. That was a masterplan for sport. It was an exercise that we undertook in 2011.
I should highlight that when we had these conversations while we heard many of these concerns, we also heard many positive things and one of the things that struck me when we had many of these conversations was that Singaporeans do continue to have a strong interest in sports. It is not just the people who had experiences in the past and reminiscence about the good old days.
Young Singaporeans, too, continue to have an interest in sports and there is nothing like sports that continue to excite us, that continue to stir our passions and bring our community together. You can certainly see that and sense that when you go for sporting events. There are many more in our calendar. They are all well attended and you can feel the excitement among the participants there at all of these events, be it a football game or say when we recently won the Asian Championships for netball in the New Singapore Sports Hub, the crowd was cheering for Team Singapore and the excitement was palpable.
So, I believe that many Singaporeans, young and old, continue to enjoy sports and they want to get involved in Sports. What they need is perhaps more opportunities to participate and to experience the joy of sports together. And that is why we launch ActiveSG last year as a national movement for sport. Through ActiveSG, we are bringing together a wider range of sporting programs to the community, relevant for different skill levels and different age groups. For example, we partnered the Singapore Athletic Association to introduce kids athletics programme, so they use modified equipment, such as lower hurdles, foam javelins to develop their motor skills. For seniors, we have weekly gym orientation programs, we invite them to come to the gym, work out and we give them tips on how to use the gym equipment.
I agree with Dr Tan that we must continue to find opportunities for older Singaporeans, active seniors, to engage in sports to stay healthy. When ActiveSG organised the Singapore National Games last year, we made a special effort to reach out and to encourage many active agers to take part in the masters category of the game. One of them is Mr Mike Ang, I met him at the closing ceremony of the games. He and his team mates participated in futsal. They are alumni from St Michael's Secondary School and they have been crazy about football since the 1960s. So, they participated in football, said this was a good opportunity for them to relive their football days. They made it all the way to the quarter finals before they got kicked out, but even so, he said that if the match had been longer, his team would have won. Clearly, the competitive spirit is there, and I am sure he will be back again for the next national games.
There are also many ActiveSG programmes that we are running to encourage busy Singaporeans to maintain an active lifestyle. We have something called urban trekking. I asked them what urban trekking is. It is basically walking, but you use walking poles, like ski poles. So, it is like Nordic walking for a full body workout. We introduced this at five sports centres and the response has been very good.
We are also organising more outdoor activities and that is why we launched Sundays at the Park, for example, to bring sports programmes into the neighbourhood green spaces, where they are convenient, where they are accessible to the public, especially the seniors. We started off with just four parks and now we have gone into 12. The programme is so popular at Choa Chu Kang Park that participation quickly increased from 50 in the first session to about 250 residents now.
These are some examples of what we are doing, and have been doing, particularly after Vision 2013, the exercise we conducted in 2011. How do we know that these efforts, including the ActiveSG programmes, are making an impact? Well, I will share with the House some indicators.
First, ActiveSG has grown quickly and steadily in its membership. Less than a year after its launch, we already have more than 670,000 members today, and these are not passive members. These are members who are actively using our sports centres and facilities and participating in the diverse range of ActiveSG events, from learn-to-play sessions to sport camps and workshops. For example, over the recent December holidays, ActiveSG organised an in-line skating competition at the Pasir Ris Sports Centre. This was a competitive event, but the parents we spoke to were less concerned about winning than being able to bond with their children.
One parent, Mr Ang Joon Hiang, was grateful for this opportunity to bond with his son, because they took part together in the father-son category, and he requested for more of such family-friendly sport activities in the future. We see many such parents and children groupings coming together to participate in our programmes.
They are doing it not for medals. They are not doing it for CCA points or grades, but they are doing it because they enjoy the game. They have the opportunity to spend quality time together as a family. So, that is one indicator of a success.
Another indicator which I would share is that we are seeing a change in the numbers coming to our swimming pools as well as the profiles of people coming to our swimming pools. In the past, our swimming pools or swimming complexes were left very much for serious swimmers to come and then they swim laps. They do regular training in the swimming pools.
Now, we are putting together more fun and innovative programmes in the pools. We have aqua, basketball, we have aqua spinning; it is cycling in the water, so that there is less impact on your knees – very popular with the elderly. We have flippa ball, which is a modified form of water polo. It is a junior version, so it is good for the kids.
So, with all these programmes, we are seeing an increased in the number of people coming to the swimming pools and also a change in the profile. We are seeing more families spending their weekends at our swimming complexes. This reminds me of one of our sports pioneers Mr C Kunalan told me when I launched ActiveSG last April. He said that he hoped ActiveSG will kick start "a new trend of families having a sporty life instead of just spending weekends at the shopping centres."
Now, I do not want to cause more problems for the retail market, but I do believe we are making progress in shifting mindsets. If we continue with these efforts, we can shape new and positive habits towards sports participation.
The third indicator is goes back to participation: we know from our surveys that the overall sports participation rate is, in fact, on the rise. Dr Tan cited the national sports participation survey in 2011 where he mentioned correctly that the proportion of Singaporeans who exercise at least once a week dropped to 42% and that was from 50% in 2005.
This national sport participation survey is done once every five years. So, the next one is in 2016, but in the interim years, in the years in between, we do some annual surveys, some annual dipsticks to get more updated data on sports participation. I am glad to share that our latest surveys for 2013 and 2014 show that the overall participation levels have in fact gone up to above 60%. We are not quite at Finland's level, which is about 70%, but we have made progress, and I think we should continue to make progress. This is also consistent with anecdotal feedback. It is not just about the surveys, because as I have mentioned, if you look around you, besides what we are doing for ActiveSG, in recent years, there have been many more sporting events. The calendar is filled with many sporting events. The number of running events is on the rise. Apart from serious running events and marathons for the fitness buffs, you have many fun community runs, all of which are very well-subscribed.
Cycling is another sport that is gaining popularity very quickly. The number of participants in the OCBC Cycle Singapore doubled from 5,400 in its inaugural year, to 11,500 cyclists last year. This is more than doubled, actually.
These are several efforts of what we are doing to provide more programming opportunities, and more opportunities for Singaporeans to participate in sports. We are seeing some results.
Besides these programming activities through ActiveSG, we are also doing more to address another concern that Dr Tan raised, which is to ensure that there is sufficient spaces and facilities for sports to be carried out, particularly, given our constraints of land. That is why I had announced previously in Parliament that we are working on a long-term sports facilities masterplan. We have five regional sports centres mapped out for this masterplan, the first of which is being built in Tampines. We are now planning for the next one in Punggol. There will eventually be five regional sports centres. At the town level, we are also adding new facilities and we are planning for a new sports and recreational centre, for example, in Sembawang. We are progressively improving our existing facilities, like the Ang Mo Kio swimming complex.
At the local level, that is, at the HDB estates, we are creating more sports facilities. We have started work on sports facilities within the precincts at Boon Lay, Jurong Spring and Tampines. We will gradually increase these sports facilities across Singapore, in tandem with the implementation of the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP), under MND. We are doing this in tandem with the NRP roll-out.
To make the most of our limited land space, we are also working with MOE to open up sports facilities in schools so that these can be made available for the public's use, after school hours. These are what we call the Dual Use Scheme facilities. It is used for school purposes, and for public sporting use.
We have already opened up many facilities. In fact, for new schools, we are ensuring that all new schools are built and designed with dual use in mind. So, sports facilities in all new schools will be designed for dual use. They will be implemented as such. For existing schools – close to half of them – already operate on this dual use model. Our aim is to eventually open up all of the schools with dual use, so that the school sports facilities can be opened up to the public. This year, we are going to make further progress by putting out 15 more indoor sports halls and 10 more school fields.
Dr Tan also raised several observations about the role of schools in promoting sports participation. I do not intend to get into all the details here. Some of these are probably more relevant to be addressed at the school level. So, it is a very specific level, for very specific feedback. I want to assure the Member that my Ministry – MCCY – and MOE are working closely together with Sports Singapore to address all of the concerns.
I would like to share three broad areas – very broad, but very important shifts that we have already made, particularly to address this issue of mindset and culture. First, we want to expose our students to sports through a quality and rigorous Physical Education (PE) curriculum. The lesson time set aside for PE has been increased to at least two hours per week. MOE has also revised its PE and sports development framework in the past year to emphasise holistic development and to encourage lifelong participation in physical activities. So, the idea is to give students more opportunities to acquire fundamental motor skills, to gain exposure to a variety of sporting experiences and to participate recreationally in physical activities. Hopefully, many more of them would be like our Deputy Speaker and would be able to cite PE as their favourite subject in school.
Secondly, MOE has also replaced the CCA-point system with a revised co-curricular recognition system that places more emphasis on participation. The new system recognises participation in sports activities outside school, such as those organised by the community clubs and the National Sports Associations (NSAs). Under this new system, students who engage in recreational sports can also aspire to achieve good CCA records. Again, an important shift, because it addresses some of the concerns that the Member raised.
Minister, you have less than a minute before we run out of time.
:  There are these things that MOE is doing. I would not elaborate further. We can share more, and if the Member has specific questions on MOE, we can address that separately.
I just want to go straight to a particular point on sporting opportunities for the disabled. This is a very important point that the Member raised and it is something close to our hearts as well. We want sports to be inclusive, and we want to provide opportunities for all members of our society to participate in sports.
We have been providing more support for para-sports, for our athletes with special needs. In fact, we have enhanced our high performance sports system to provide more support to all athletes, including para-athletes. In our system, we provide equal support to both able-bodied and para-athletes. For example, we have an athlete like Laurentia Tan who is a paralympian, who today receives $90,000 of funding support a year. It is not just meagre support for transportation allowance. Ninety thousand dollars a year in the form of stipends and grants to support coaching, competition, equipment. We are providing more support for both able-bodied and para-athletes. It is not just financial support but support in many other areas. For a para-athlete like Nurul who plays boccia. She has spinal muscular dystrophy. She sits on a wheelchair and she takes a ramp to let the ball down to play bocce. We are working with Nanyang Polytehnic to do research on the design of the ramp, so that through research and development, we can improve the design and make it better for her. So, this is the support that we give to her.
Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would just say that this year presents us with a wonderful opportunity to further excite and inspire Singaporeans about sports participation because this year, we host the SEA Games in June and we host the ASEAN Para Games for the first time in December. Of course, we are working very hard to make sure that we organise a good Games for our friends from the region, but we also want to make sure that we leave behind a lasting legacy for the Games, for Singaporeans. That legacy must be one where we get more Singaporeans onto our journey of sports, participating in sports, supporting our Team Singapore athletes and ultimately, living better through sports. Thank you.
Adjourned accordingly at 6.25 pm.
asked the Minister for National Development since March 2012, how many families with a monthly household income of between $1,000 and $1,200 (inclusive) have (i) applied for and subsequently booked or (ii) been invited but failed to book 2-room or larger HDB BTO flats.
: For BTO exercises between March 2012 and July 2014 where selection has been completed, 744 families with monthly household income of between $1,000 and $1,200 booked a 2-room or larger BTO flat. Over the same period, 655 other families in the same income bracket were invited to select a BTO flat but they did not proceed to book one.
asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry can allow voluntary extension of the Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS) up to age 65.
: The Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS) was introduced in 1989, with the primary objective of providing CPF members, especially those who have just started working and have not built up substantial savings in their CPF account, with affordable insurance protection. It provides their dependants with a sum of money to tide them over the initial difficult period should they become permanently incapacitated or pass on.
Currently, DPS cover stops at age 60. The need for DPS is expected to decline as the member approaches retirement. His children are likely to be already working or less financially dependent. He would also have accumulated significant CPF savings which could support his remaining dependants in the event of his death.
In addition, premiums for coverage beyond age 60 would be significantly higher because of higher mortality rates. The DPS premium for coverage from age 60 to 65, is estimated to cost about as much as what a CPF member would pay over the entire preceding 35 years between the ages of 25 and 60. Extending DPS coverage to age 65 on an opt-in basis will result in even higher premiums because of higher anti-selection risk where a larger proportion among the less healthy may choose to take up DPS coverage.
Setting the DPS age limit at 60 strikes a balance between providing insurance protection for the CPF member’s dependants and preserving his CPF savings for his own retirement needs. CPF members who wish to have life insurance coverage beyond age 60 may consider obtaining it from private insurers.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources following the death of a boy after having consumed food from a stall at a food court at Northpoint Shopping Centre (a) why was the case not highlighted to the public when it happened in January this year; (b) whether there are other cases where the victims have since recovered; and (c) what steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of such an incident.
31
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what has been the number of deaths due to food poisoning at NEA-licensed food establishments in the past five years; (b) whether NEA can provide an update on the recent case whereby a four-year-old boy died from salmonella septicaemia after eating at a food court at Northpoint Shopping Centre in Yishun; (c) why is there a time lag from the time of the incident till the coroner's inquiry when public is alerted; and (d) what are the additional measures that the Ministry will take to ensure that food sold at retail outlets is prepared hygienically and thus safe for consumption.
: The National Environment Agency (NEA) was notified of the episode on 24 January 2014 when the tragic incident was also reported in Tamil Murasu. NEA took immediate action by conducting an inspection of the food stall jointly with the Ministry of Health (MOH) on the same day. There were no other reported cases implicating this food stall. For public health safety, NEA suspended the stall’s licence on the very same day.
Two hygiene lapses were detected – failure to register a food handler and failure to protect food in a covered receptacle. These lapses contravened the Environmental Public Health (Food Hygiene) Regulations. The operator was directed to conduct a thorough cleaning of the food stall and for all its food handlers to re-attend the Basic Food Hygiene Course. The suspension was lifted after NEA was satisfied that the licensee had thoroughly cleaned the food stall, and food samples and environmental swabs taken from the food stall all tested negative for food borne pathogens. NEA then sought the Attorney-General's Chambers’ advice and waited for the Coroner’s Inquiry to be completed before pursuing Court action.
The findings of the State Coroner were released on 30 October 2014 and reviewed on 31 December 2014. NEA has taken the licensee to Court for the two food hygiene offences and the licensee was fined a total of $1,400 by the Court on 2 December 2014. The licensee has also cancelled her food stall licence after the food court operator terminated her tenancy agreement on 7 November 2014. This episode is a good reminder of the importance for all food stall and food shop operators to practise good food and personal hygiene.
NEA currently licenses about 35,000 retail food establishments. There were no other fatalities linked to food poisoning from NEA-licensed premises since 2010. NEA takes lapses in food hygiene very seriously. Strict enforcement action will be taken against any errant food retail outlets who do not practise good food hygiene. The penalties for violations of the Environmental Public Health (Food Hygiene) Regulations were increased for all categories of food hygiene offences in April 2010. For exposing of cooked food without proper cover and for failing to register assistants, the licensee may be fined up to a maximum of $2,000 upon conviction of the offence. They will also accumulate demerit points for each offence committed and upon accumulating 12 demerit points within a 12 month period, their licence will be suspended as an additional administrative penalty for two weeks. If the licensee continues to be recalcitrant and practise poor food hygiene practices, their licence may be revoked.
asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider getting employers to advertise for all jobs via the Jobs Bank.
: We encourage all employers to post their job vacancies on the Jobs Bank. It is a convenient platform, which is free-of-charge, for employers to search for the workers that they need. Over 63,000 Singaporeans have registered on the Jobs Bank so far. This is a good pool of potential employees for employers to tap on. Over 14,000 employers are registered with the Jobs Bank, with about 80% actively posting job vacancies. Feedback from employers and job-seekers on the Jobs Bank has been positive.
The Jobs Bank complements existing job-matching services and other recruitment tools. Employers should have the flexibility to decide how they search for workers. Some employers may find other forms of recruitment, such as headhunting or other recruitment processes, more suitable for their needs. Countries with similar jobs banks do not require all jobs to be advertised on them.
asked the Minister for Manpower whether the information database accumulated within the National Jobs Bank can be used to provide published guides to help prospective job seekers in understanding the factors contributing to successful and unsuccessful placements.
: We thank Prof Tan for his helpful suggestion that we make use of the information from the Jobs Bank to help jobseekers find jobs successfully. We intend to look into how data from the Jobs Bank can be used, to supplement other available data to help job seekers.
Having said that, we should bear in mind that the success of an individual’s job search is affected by many factors, such as the economic situation, hiring needs of employers, and whether the individual’s skills match what is required by employers. During interviews, employers evaluate candidates based on criteria that might not be directly observable and captured in databases. Thus, the information from the Jobs Bank does not fully encompass an employer’s hiring considerations or factors which contribute to a successful placement.
We encourage individuals who wish to have a better understanding of the factors contributing to successful placement to access resources such as labour market information and job search guides available on the Singapore Workforce Development Agency’s websites. Job seekers who require more in-depth or personalised assistance can approach WDA Career Centres or the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to access a range of services and programmes. These range from Career Skills Workshops to equip job seekers with skills in resume writing, grooming, and interviews, to personal or group coaching services for those who require more intensive career review and advice.
asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry has received feedback from school bus operators on their challenges to stay in business amidst rising operating costs due to insurance, replacement of old vehicles and shortage of drivers and, if so, what is the Ministry doing to ensure that there are sufficient school bus operators to offer transport services to students who need such services as well as to keep transport services affordable.
: The Ministry of Education is monitoring the provision of school bus services. In recent months, we have received feedback from some parents regarding the availability and affordability of school bus services as well as feedback from the school bus operators on the challenges and cost pressures that they faced.
We appreciate the need for school bus services to be affordable for parents and financially viable for bus operators. We are looking into the feedback provided, and will be engaging school bus operators to discuss the issues. We will also work with LTA on these.
asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what short-term and long-term measures are developed to protect our culinary heritage and nurture our culinary arts; and (b) whether the National Heritage Board as custodian of our heritage can take on the primary responsibility of protecting the nation's culinary culture and, if not, what agency is being tasked to take this on.
: The National Heritage Board (NHB) recognises that food is an important part of Singapore’s shared heritage.
NHB actively organises talks, exhibitions and events to promote our culinary heritage. The Singapore Philatelic Museum’s popular interactive and multi-sensorial "Spice is Nice" exhibition for young children is a case in point. NHB also supports a range of projects to document our culinary culture. For example, it recently produced a six-part documentary based on its well-received publication Wartime Kitchen Food and Eating in Singapore 1942-50.
Many of these exhibitions and programmes are done in partnership with the community. For instance, NHB partnered a group of heritage volunteers to create a food and heritage trail for Balestier, and plans to do more of such trails. The NHB’s Heritage Grant scheme has also supported several food publications related to Singapore food, including a book by food blogger Dr Leslie Tay, author of the popular blog ieatishootipost.
Education is another important way of preserving our food culture. Recognising that hawker food culture forms an integral part of our culinary heritage, NHB in collaboration with the National Environment Agency (NEA) produced a travelling exhibition on the history and evolution of hawker centres. NHB will also co-organise with NEA an Art and Heritage Initiative involving 75 schools and organisations to create site-specific murals inspired by our heritage and food culture to raise public appreciation of hawker centres which are unique to Singapore.
In addition, the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) and NEA piloted the Hawker Master Trainer Pilot Programme (HMTPP) to give aspiring hawkerpreneurs the opportunity to train with veteran hawkers in order to preserve our hawker heritage. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) also organises and promotes the annual Singapore Food Festival (SFF), which showcases our local culinary talents and local food, including heritage cuisines and restaurants.
There will be several initiatives during our Golden Jubilee year to celebrate our food heritage. For instance, Let’s Makan will support interested individuals in organising up to 300 potluck local home-cooked food sessions among small groups of neighbours. NHB will work with partners for special projects that celebrate food heritage, including documenting and featuring 50 signature Singaporean dishes and their recipes.
Many stakeholders in the public, private and people sectors have an interest in our nation’s food culture. The NHB has and will continue to do its part in celebrating and preserving our food heritage.
asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the plans of the Smart Nation Programme Office to engage citizens and industries to ensure that the initiative is about "people, not machines"; (b) what are the key performance measures for the success of the Programme Office; and (c) how does the Programme Office plan to engage and prepare citizens, especially the less technology-savvy, and small businesses for the Smart Nation wave in the near future.
: The aim of our Smart Nation Programme is to enhance the quality of life, create more opportunities and strengthen community bonds for all Singaporeans by integrating emerging new technologies into our daily lives. The key focus must be the needs of our people, and not just the deployment of interesting technologies.
Therefore, it is critical that we engage citizens and the private sector extensively in order to assess the needs of different segments of our society, to identify opportunities and to co-develop innovative solutions in many diverse areas, including healthcare, transport, education, estate management, public services and entrepreneurship. For a start, we intend to focus on how technology can help our seniors, youth and local SMEs.
This month, I am meeting a group of seniors who volunteer in the community. This kicks off a series of engagement exercises to reach out to different groups of seniors and their caregivers. We want to understand how best to use technology to serve them better.
Similarly, we will engage other segments, including our youths, innovators and the local SMEs. The Smart Nation Programme Office is working with various agencies such as SPRING and MOH on these efforts.
Mr Zaqy asked about plans to prepare citizens, especially the less technology savvy, for the future. Since November 2014, the Skills Future Council, chaired by DPM Tharman, has started work to drive the national effort to develop skills for the future. For those who are less technology savvy, especially the seniors who generally have had less opportunity to pick up IT skills, we have several measures to help them. Volunteer groups and Community Clubs run Silver Infocomm Junctions to help seniors familiarise themselves with IT. IDA organises various annual programmes such as Inter-Generation IT Bootcamp and Silver Infocomm Day to promote IT awareness and adoption. We will study what more we can do, together with the community playing its part.
As for the Smart Nation Programme Office, its key role is to take in perspectives and ideas from different sources, and integrate them to ensure that we take a whole-of-government, whole-of-nation approach to building a Smart Nation. We will refine the targets as we consult and engage more groups.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider having all foreigners with foreign driving licences undergo Basic Theory Test, Final Theory Test and defensive driving courses.
: Currently, a person holding a valid foreign licence is required to pass the Basic Theory Test before he can convert to a local motorcycle or Class 3/3A licence. The requirement to pass the Basic Theory Test ensures that foreign drivers are acquainted with the Highway Code and traffic rules and regulations, including our traffic/road signs and signals. A foreign driving licence holder is also required to take and pass the Class 4 or 5 Practical Driving Tests before he can obtain a local heavy vehicle licence.
We have recently reviewed the licence conversion requirements for foreign workers. As announced in this House in September 2014, we will raise the foreign licence conversion requirements for Work Permit and S-Pass holders who drive Class 3 vehicles. From 1 June 2015, Work Permit and S-Pass holders will be required to pass the Practical Driving Test in addition to the Basic Theory Test to convert to a local Class 3 licence. This will better ensure that these drivers are competent and familiar with driving on our roads.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry how will an established ASEAN Economic Community attract investments, create jobs and help manage regional challenges within the ASEAN region in the next few years.
: The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) aims to create a single market and production base across ASEAN economies, with minimal barriers to trade and investment. The AEC has three elements. First, the liberalisation of trade in goods through the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA). Second, the liberalisation of services through the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS). And third, the liberalisation of investment through the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA). Under these three Agreements, ASEAN members commit to facilitate and enhance trade in goods, services and investment flows in the region.
The benefits for Singapore companies are significant. For instance, with the elimination of import duties under the ATIGA, companies will enjoy greater price competitiveness for their products. Companies can also expand and establish stronger and wider presence in the region. As these commitments are enshrined within the Agreements, companies will also be able to operate in a more stable and predictable business environment.
Under the AFAS, companies will enjoy reduced barriers to services trade, such as the lowering of foreign equity limits and liberalisation of more services sectors. This will attract more investment, including from beyond the region. Investors in ASEAN will also benefit from stronger and pro-business investment rules present in the ACIA.
Fundamentally, a more economically integrated ASEAN will generate greater opportunities for its citizens, including for Singaporeans. ASEAN is a growing market of 620 million people, and make-up the third largest combined GDP in Asia – at US$2.3 trillion in 2013

, behind China and Japan. Closer economic integration within ASEAN will not only raise living standards but also contribute towards stronger regional stability. It is with this in mind that ASEAN countries remain strongly committed. Therefore, during their Summit in November 2014, ASEAN Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to expedite the implementation of the remaining measures in the AEC 2015 Blueprint so as to create a politically cohesive, economically integrated and socially responsible ASEAN Community.
asked the Minister for National Development with regard to public housing and schools that are being built next to major expressways (a) whether the planning and development agencies take into consideration the significant traffic noise that will impact upon the well-being of residents and students there; and (b) whether there are noise-mitigating measures featured in the design of such developments.
: The planning and development agencies are mindful of the possible impact of traffic noise on developments. There are planning requirements in place to ensure sufficient setback distance of public housing and schools from expressways. Approval must be sought from planning and relevant agencies before development takes place.
Besides compliance with planning requirements, design measures, where feasible, are also adopted. These include orientating public housing blocks away from the expressway, locating Multi-Storey Car Parks next to the expressway, and planting more trees as noise buffers. Similar design measures are also applied in the case of schools.
HDB will continue to explore other practical noise mitigation measures to preserve the comfort and well-being of our residents and students.
asked the Minister for Transport how will an open skies agreement within the ASEAN region assist and benefit Singapore and ASEAN states.
: ASEAN has concluded three air services agreements which collectively provide for unlimited passenger and cargo air services between all ASEAN cities with international airports. The agreements are integral to ASEAN’s vision of a Single Aviation Market, in support of the establishment of an ASEAN Economic Community by 2015. Almost all the ASEAN Member States have ratified the instruments and I am hopeful that we will meet the 2015 timeline to establish this intra-ASEAN open skies.
Intra-ASEAN travel has grown strongly at a compounded annual growth rate of 13% from 2009-2013. Looking ahead, some analysts have projected an annual growth rate of 8% for the next 20 years. Establishing an intra-ASEAN open skies will promote air connectivity within ASEAN and bring about even greater flows of trade, investment and tourism in the region.
For Singapore, pursuing a liberal air services regime in ASEAN and beyond would enable more carriers, local and foreign, to operate to and from Changi, strengthening Changi’s network and connectivity, and anchoring Singapore’s position as an air hub in support of our economic development.
A liberal ASEAN air services regime would also facilitate ASEAN’s air services liberalisation efforts with major Dialogue Partners. These ASEAN-Dialogue Partner air services engagements enable ASEAN to leverage its collective strength to negotiate air services agreements that are more ambitious than what each ASEAN Member State would be able to achieve bilaterally with the Dialogue Partner.
For instance, through the ASEAN-China air services engagement, both sides have concluded the ASEAN-China Air Transport Agreement and two Implementing Protocols. This has provided Singapore and our ASEAN neighbours air rights that are above what each ASEAN Member State has concluded bilaterally with China. ASEAN has also begun air services negotiations with other Dialogue Partners, including South Korea, Japan, and the EU, and we look forward to concluding liberal and mutually beneficial air services agreements with them.
asked the Minister for Health (a) with the forthcoming implementation of the new Enhanced Nursing Home Standards (ENHS) in 2015, how and what are the efforts put in by the Ministry to help nursing homes measure up to the ENHS; and (b) when preparing the nursing homes for the ENHS, what are some of the shortfalls that the Ministry finds in the nursing homes.
: The new set of nursing home standards was developed by an industry-led workgroup to ensure that our seniors receive consistent quality care. It was finalised in January 2014 after consultations with the wider industry and members of the public.
Guide to ENHS
MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) have launched several efforts to help nursing homes achieve these standards. Last April, we launched a Guide to ENHS for nursing homes. The Guide explains how the nursing homes could meet these standards and provides examples of processes, tools and templates that nursing homes can adopt. The Guide has been well received.
Baseline Assessments
Over 90% of nursing homes have also participated in AIC’s voluntary baseline assessments to help each nursing home identify particular needs and potential areas for improvements to meet the standards.
From the baseline assessments, some of the areas that need enhancement include existing requirements, such as care planning and emergency preparedness, and new requirements such as advanced care planning, dignity of care, psychosocial and mental health, and organisational excellence.
Building capabilities
AIC has designed training to help nursing homes enhance their capabilities in these areas. Funding support is available for nursing homes to send their staff for these training courses and participants can receive up to 90% subsidy on their course fees. In 2014, AIC conducted more than 200 runs of training courses, providing over 4,000 training places in support of ENHS. Regional Health Systems (RHS) have also offered training in clinical areas to the nursing homes to help improve their care standards.
The training courses cover the existing requirements that need enhancements. For example, over 40% of nursing homes (or 24 homes) have already completed care planning training with AIC in 2014 and additional runs will be held in 2015 to cater to homes’ needs. In addition, we will place emphasis on areas with new requirements. As these domains have been articulated in the ENHS and are new standards, nursing homes may need more help to develop enhanced systems and processes. To support our nursing homes, AIC is developing additional training programmes with feedback from the sector for these areas. AIC has also started regular learning platforms for homes to share best practices with each other for improvement since February 2014 and about half of all nursing homes are regularly represented at these sessions.
Conclusion
MOH plans to introduce the standards in April 2015, but only enforce this in April 2016 after a one-year grace period. We will continue to work closely with the sector to support nursing homes in meeting the enhanced standards so that our seniors can enjoy better quality care.
asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will be embarking on stricter regulations for certain testing and management of clinical conditions in the private practice sector, from primary to tertiary care, along the lines of published clinical guidelines set out in the Ministry's publications.
: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been publishing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) since 1998. Many of these CPGs have been focused on ensuring primary care providers are updated on the current best practice in common conditions that they encounter, an example being the "MOH CPG on Diabetes Mellitus" published in March 2014.
There have also been CPGs to guide providers in hospital care, an example being the "MOH CPG on the use of intravenous recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rTPA) in Ischaemic Stroke Patients", aimed at providing guidance on timely initiation of this therapy in centres with appropriate facilities and expertise.
While the main aim of MOH’s CPG programme has been to provide guidance to both public and private sector doctors on appropriate management of disease conditions, CPGs can also be used to guide the development of clinical programmes and audits. Examples of these were the CPGs related to the management of chronic diseases. Recommended clinical care components for the Medisave for Chronic Disease Management Programme were extracted from the relevant chronic disease CPGs and formed the basis for evaluation of appropriate practice thereafter.
Going forward, MOH will continue to strengthen its CPG framework and other measures to ensure that patients receive appropriate care and avoid over-consumption.
asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider awarding the full salary claim on top of a fine when an employer refuses to turn up for an adjudication on a salary claim by a professional, manager or executive (PME).
: Under the Employment Act, the Commissioner for Labour may hear and decide on salary claims of employees covered under the Act, including a professional, manager or executive (PME) earning up to $4,500 a month. If an employer fails to turn up for the Commissioner’s inquiry without a valid reason, the Commissioner has the power to proceed to hear and make a decision in the absence of the employer, notwithstanding the fact that he is not present. If an employee who lodges the claim fails to attend the inquiry without a valid reason, his claim may be struck off. Given this, the Ministry is of the view that there is no need to introduce additional measures on any party to the claim who fails to turn up for the inquiry without a valid reason.
In addition, every salary-related offence will be investigated and an appropriate enforcement action will be taken against the errant employer, including curbing his work pass privileges, imposition of composition fines and prosecution, which includes a fine or imprisonment or both.
asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the status on achieving the vision of the new Enabling Masterplan 2012-2016 especially for our children with special needs; (b) whether the Special Education (SPED) schools are able to cope with the intake of students; and (c) what are the continuing education and lifelong enabling plans for persons with disabilities beyond their school going years.
: The recommendations of the 2012-2016 Enabling Masterplan (EM) cover a range of issues, including those relating to improving the quality, accessibility and affordability of Special Education (SPED).
To improve quality, we have reviewed the SPED curriculum and built teacher capacity.
The SPED Curriculum Framework was launched in 2012 to guide the design and delivery of curriculum in SPED schools. A well- designed curriculum will better enable SPED students to achieve quality living, learning and working outcomes. We have helped every SPED school to set up curriculum teams to translate the Curriculum Framework into quality learning experiences based on the student profile in the school. Schools have also set up Professional Learning Teams to support teacher-led curriculum innovation. MOE has supported these teams with training and consultancy in curriculum development. Curriculum improvement is a long-term undertaking and MOE will continue to work hand-in-hand with SPED schools to meet our students’ needs.
Skilful and committed teachers are essential if we are to teach well. To enhance the professionalism of teachers in the SPED schools, MOE has worked with the National Institute of Education (NIE) to introduce courses such as the Diploma in Special Education and the Advanced Diploma in Special Education. MOE has also provided training funds to expand the opportunities for professional development for all SPED teachers. SPED schools have used these training funds to conduct workshops and support teachers’ participation in local and overseas conferences.
To address accessibility, MOE has been monitoring the SPED landscape and studying disability trends so that we could work with the SPED sector to provide sufficient places for students of different disabilities.
MOE has made significant investments in SPED school infrastructure over the years to increase the capacity of SPED schools catering to different disability profiles. We funded the construction of 15 purpose-built SPED schools and refurbished 5 SPED schools with customised facilities. We have also expanded the capacity of specific SPED schools to meet the rising demand for places catering to specific disabilities. For instance, in 2012, a new wing was constructed for Metta School, and the new and larger campus for Delta Senior School was completed in 2013.
Overall, there are sufficient vacancies within the SPED schools for new student admissions. However, we are seeing an increase in the number of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and higher demand for schools catering to ASD. Some of these schools now have waitlists for admission. To reduce these waitlists, MOE is expanding the physical capacity of these ASD schools, and working closely with the National Council of Social Services (NCSS) and SPED schools to recruit more teachers.
Moving forward, MOE, together with the NCSS, will continue to monitor SPED school places, infrastructure and manpower situation, to ensure that all students with moderate to severe special educational needs have timely access to SPED schools.
MOE has also been working to enhance the SPED curriculum to better equip students with the knowledge and skills for independent living and integration into society.
We have introduced vocational education in SPED schools to develop work habits and skills that prepare students for work in a regular workplace so that they integrate better into society. Gainful employment can enable our SPED graduates who are capable of work to develop a sense of self-worth, independence and dignity.
We are also enhancing transition support for SPED students to post-school living, learning and working options in ways which are suited for different profiles of student. MSF recently set up SG Enable, which will look into enhancing training and employment options for adults with disabilities. MOE is working closely with MSF and SG Enable to better facilitate students’ transition from school to work and to expand the range of vocational training opportunities, work experience and employment opportunities for students.
asked the Minister for Education over the past five years (a) what percentage of students have taken a non-official mother tongue language in lieu of their mother tongue language for the Primary School Leaving Examination; (b) how many of them are Singaporean students; and (c) what are the main reasons for granting such permission to Singaporean students.
: Under the bilingual education policy, all students in our primary and secondary schools are required to offer a Mother Tongue Language (MTL).
In implementing the policy, we exercise some flexibility and allow students with exceptional circumstances to offer an approved Foreign or Asian Language in lieu of MTL. There are broadly two groups of students who can be given this permission. They are either students who join the school system mid-stream from non-MTL speaking countries, or students with at least one parent who is foreign born and of non-Chinese/Malay/Indian ethnicity.
Over the past five years, the group of students offering an approved Foreign or Asian Language has remained small, at around 1% of a PSLE cohort on average. The proportion of Singapore students doing so has remained stable, at around 0.2% of each cohort.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the total number of HDB rental flats currently set aside for the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS); (b) how many rental flats under the JSS are currently occupied by a single tenant who cannot find a replacement flatmate after the grace period; and (c) what steps will HDB take to better match single tenants, mitigate conflict and ensure quick replacements of departed flatmates.
: Of the 50,000 rental flats, 12,000 are occupied by tenants under the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS). HDB does not set a quota on the number of rental flats for JSS tenants.
Some 1,900 flats are currently occupied by single JSS tenants as their original flatmates have left and their replacements are being sought. There is a grace period of six months for the remaining tenant to find a joint tenant.
We encourage the tenants to look for someone they know, like a relative or friend. HDB also provides them with a list of single applicants, or introduces them to other single tenants of a similar profile, whom they may contact before mutually agreeing to jointly rent a flat. The key is mutual respect and tolerance. Most are able to get along. In the event of dispute, HDB will advise them to settle their dispute amicably or approach the Community Mediation Centre for mediation.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether plans for barrier-free hawker centres and markets can be streamlined; and (b) whether barrier-free modifications such as ramps or wheelchair spaces at tables can be considered for existing hawker centres.
: The hawker centres provide all members of our community with affordable food in an informal setting. It is, therefore, important for hawker centres to be barrier-free and easily accessible to all. The National Environment Agency (NEA) will ensure that all new hawker centres will comply with the Building and Construction Authority’s (BCA) Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment 2013. Although existing hawker centres were built prior to the Code being established, NEA has incorporated barrier-free infrastructure into these centres over time, like ramps and wheelchair spaces at tables.
Today, all hawker centres meet or exceed BCA’s basic accessibility standards, except for three centres. Two of these centres will undergo redevelopment and upgrading over the next few years and will meet the accessibility standards when completed. The third – Dunman Food Centre – currently does not meet the standards due to site constraints, but NEA will continue to explore ways to improve the accessibility of this centre.
asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources following the inclusion of HDB void decks, corridors, staircases and stairwells as smoke-free areas in January 2013 (a) how many smoking offenders have been booked by NEA; (b) what action has been taken against these offenders; and (c) whether NEA is looking into any new plans on how to enforce the rules more effectively.
: From 15 April 2013 to 30 November 2014, the National Environment Agency (NEA) took over 23,900 enforcement actions against smokers who flouted the smoking prohibition law. Of these, some 52% (or about 12,400) were for smoking in the new smoking prohibited areas, namely, common corridors, stairwells and void decks in residential areas, sheltered walkways and linkways, overhead bridges, hospital outdoor compounds and five-metre buffer zone around bus shelters. The offenders were issued fines of $200. Under the law, repeat offenders may be liable to a fine of up to $1,000 if convicted in Court.
Before the prohibition took effect on 15 January 2013, NEA had publicised the smoking ban extension in major newspapers, TV and radio, as well as through social media platforms. Posters, banners and "No Smoking" signs had been placed at HDB void decks, staircases and stairwells as reminders. Brochures had also been distributed to smokers through channels such as retail shops to inform smokers of the new smoking-prohibited areas. To further extend the outreach efforts, trained volunteers also conducted community patrols to advise smokers in their estates on the smoking prohibition extension during the three-month advisory period at the start of the ban.
NEA will continue to ensure compliance with the smoking prohibition law through sustained enforcement and outreach. We will need the support of the community, schools and non-government organisations to safeguard our public health and create a conducive environment for everyone.
asked the Minister for Transport for major expressways that have public housing and schools being built next to them, whether LTA will look into adding traffic noise reduction features for such expressways so that residents and students there can have a reasonably conducive environment to live and study.
: LTA has embarked on a trial installation of noise barriers at three locations to assess their suitability and effectiveness. The construction of the barrier at the Anak Bukit Flyover of the Pan Island Expressway was completed in October 2014. Installation for West Coast Highway and the new flyover along Braddell Road is planned for completion in mid-2015 and end-2016 respectively. LTA will try its best to conclude the trial and assessment as early as possible.
asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will regulate school bus fares charged by school bus operators so as to keep transport services affordable for students who need such services.
: School bus services are customised to meet the needs of individual schools and parents, and school bus fares will need to take into account specific operating considerations, such as route distance, capacity of buses and the number of students along the route. As such, they are not amenable to a common fare structure. On the other hand, capping school bus fares arbitrarily may result in a situation where some schools and students are under-served.
For these reasons, it is better to let school bus fares be market determined. MOE schools use a competitive process to invite bids from the operators. The competitiveness of fares proposed by tenderers is one of the key evaluation factors considered by the schools, although the eventual fares payable are negotiated between the parents and the successful operator.
On our part, the Government has put in place measures to help school bus operators keep their operating costs low so that they can offer more competitive fares. For example, private bus owners are given a 50% road tax rebate if their buses are also used to provide school bus services. Those registered as School Buses are exempted from Certificate of Entitlement requirements.
asked the Minister for Health what has been the take-up rate under the Pioneer Generation Package for subsidised treatment at (i) polyclinics and Specialist Outpatient Clinics; and (ii) private medical and dental clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme.
: The Government introduced the Pioneer Generation Package in recognition of our Pioneers’ contributions to nation building. From 1 September 2014, Pioneer patients receive an additional 50% off subsidised services at polyclinics and subsidised Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs). All Pioneers can benefit from special Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) subsidies when they visit private medical and dental clinics under the scheme. More recently, since 1 January 2015, Pioneers also receive an additional 50% off subsidised medications at polyclinics and subsidised SOCs.
Over a 3-month period from September to November 2014, about 300,000 Pioneers have made a visit to the subsidised SOCs, polyclinics or CHAS clinics. There were about 250,000 visits by Pioneers to the subsidised SOCs, 330,000 visits by Pioneers to the polyclinics, and 340,000 visits by Pioneers to CHAS clinics. A total of $27 million in additional special subsidies were received by the Pioneers for these visits.
asked the Minister for Defence whether the Ministry will consider giving an award/grant to families of Singaporean soldiers who have died while in service since 1965, in recognition of the soldiers' contributions to nation-building and as part of SG50 celebrations.
: SAF’s existing framework of awards and grants are based on the principles of appropriate recognition and compensation for soldiers who die in service. Awards are given to recognise our servicemen who have distinguished themselves by acts of exceptional courage and sacrifice which go beyond the call of duty. Compensation amounts take reference from the Work Injury Compensation Act.
It would not be appropriate to vary the criteria for awards or grants based on special occasions such as the SG50 celebrations. We should keep to the principles underlying these awards and grants to maintain equity within and across generations.
Instead, there are other ways in which to acknowledge those who have died in the service of our country as Singapore celebrates our 50th birthday. Various units will use this occasion to commemorate all those who have contributed to building the SAF. We hope that these commemorative efforts will inspire current and future generations to recognise the sacrifices of our servicemen, especially of those who have died for the service of our nation, and strengthen their own resolve to keep our home safe and secure.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry has plans to address the issue of obstruction of common areas which is the problem accounting for about 32% of all estate maintenance issues for Town Councils; and (b) how can the Ministry create national awareness and public education on how such obstructions are potential fire hazards and can hamper fire evacuations during emergencies.
: MND takes a serious view of obstructions in common areas. Not only do such obstructions inhibit the use of the common areas, they are potential fire hazards and may hamper evacuation during emergencies.
Hence, Town Councils (TCs) have by-laws to regulate the use of the common property, including the placing of objects at common areas. These by-laws are typically guided by Singapore Civil Defence Force’s (SCDF) guidelines. The TCs work closely with SCDF to regulate and carry out enforcement actions on residents who cause such obstructions.
To raise awareness amongst residents on the dangers of obstructions, HDB organises regular exhibitions, roadshows, public talks and school outreaches. HDB also actively promotes gracious and harmonious living in HDB towns through programmes such as the Good Neighbours Movement and the Heartland Ambassadors Programme.
On the TCs’ end, the TCs use various platforms such as the TC websites, newsletters and posters on Notice Boards at void decks to reach out to their residents. Residents should also play their part by removing corridor clutter to ensure a safe and pleasant living environment for all.
asked the Minister for National Development given that the Government grant to Gardens by the Bay increased from $23 million in the November 2011 to March 2013 period to $27 million in the April 2013 to March 2014 period, whether the Government plans for Gardens by the Bay to be commercially self-sustaining eventually and, if so, by when.
: Gardens by the Bay (GB) is a national public garden for Singaporeans. It is a people’s garden meant for all to enjoy. Except for the Conservatories, GB’s recreational garden spaces and facilities, which make up 90% of the site, are free and accessible to the public. The Government grant to GB is used to offset the operating expenses incurred in the upkeep of this as well as to support GB’s active community programming.
Since its opening, GB has run a wide range of non-ticketed programmes and activities to reach out to our local community. Major festivals and events such as the Mid-Autumn Festival @ The Gardens and the recently concluded Christmas Wonderland were well-received by Singaporeans.
There is no plan to make GB self-funding.
asked the Minister for Transport how will the system of increasing fines for repeat car-parking offences be applied in residential areas where there are insufficient car-parking facilities for residents' vehicles.
: Illegal parking poses a threat to the safety of other motorists and pedestrians and impedes traffic flow. With effect from 1 January 2015, all motorists who repeat an illegal parking offence within 12 months will pay a higher tier of fines. This is to serve as a stronger deterrent and applies to illegal parking along any public road, including those in private residential estates.
If there are parking issues in private residential estates, the community and grassroots Advisers may engage the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to discuss appropriate parking schemes.
asked the Minister for National Development with regard to the reclaiming of Lim Chu Kang farm land for military use (a) what impact will this have on our local agriculture industry; (b) whether there will be sufficient land at the new sites for the farms; (c) whether there is any sort of a guaranteed tenure for the farms as they will incur huge losses if they have to keep moving; and (d) what measures will be taken to engage farms and improve their expertise to increase productivity so that they may better utilise the Agriculture Productivity Fund.
: Given the land constraint in Singapore, we have to balance different land use needs such as housing, industry, transport infrastructure, defence, greenery and farming. We regularly review these needs to ensure optimal use for our people. The western part of Lim Chu Kang, which includes vacant land and some farm sites, will be needed for military training purposes, as the current military training land will be taken up for the development of Tengah New Town.
We are taking steps to minimise the impact on our local agriculture sector. First, AVA will tender new farm sites in Sungei Tengah and other parts of Lim Chu Kang. While the total area of the new farm sites will be smaller than that of the affected farms, the long-term impact on our local food production will likely be minimal if the right production technologies are adopted. AVA will delineate the sites so that they are of optimal size for farm production. Farmers who demonstrate consistently high productivity rates will be assessed favourably in their bids for the new farm sites. They will also have to continue to maintain good farm productivity in the new sites.
Second, following engagement and in response to feedback from farmers, the new farm sites will have a 10-year lease, longer than the current arrangement of ad-hoc, short-term lease extensions of three years. At the end of the 10-year period, if the land is not required for development and the farm meets the prevailing minimum production level and other prevailing criteria, AVA is prepared to extend their leases for another 10 years. The new lease model will better ensure productive use of the land for agriculture and provide the farmers with greater certainty.
Third, the 62 farms affected by the development of military training land have been given sufficient notice so that they can decide if they wish to continue farming by bidding for the new farm sites, or to make alternative plans. Farms whose leases or tenancies are expiring between 2014 to early 2017 will be given an extension till June 2017. Those expiring after June 2017 can remain until the end of their current leases, ie, up to 2021.
Finally, AVA will continue to work with the farmers to help them raise their productivity. AVA has launched the $63 million Agriculture Productivity Fund in October 2014. The Fund helps our farmers raise their capabilities, and optimise their land through the use of appropriate farming equipment and productive systems. AVA has also organised study trips to countries such as Israel and the Netherlands for our farmers to learn best practices for greater productivity.
asked the Minister for National Development whether any action will be taken by the Government to protect the safety of diners eating at the roadside section of food outlets.
: Dining areas that are located just outside of food and beverage (F&B) outlets are known as Outdoor Refreshment Areas or ORAs. They may be allowed on a small-scale along the covered walkways of buildings. Such ORAs are separated from roads by open walkways and planting verges, shielding diners from the road traffic. In selected areas, such as along Club Street and Ann Siang Road, F&B outlets can lease spaces on the roads to set up interim ORAs during the road closure hours.
F&B operators who intend to set up ORAs have to seek permission from the Urban Redevelopment Authority. If approved, they must meet regulatory requirements imposed by various Government agencies to ensure public safety and also to minimise disamenities to pedestrians and the neighbourhood community. If the operators flout the rules, the relevant Government agencies will take enforcement action.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Ministry intends to review the current income criteria to qualify for a subsidised rental flat; and (b) when was the last time a review on income requirement was conducted.
: From time to time, we review the income ceiling and other eligibility criteria for HDB rental flats. This is to ensure that our stock of some 50,000 rental flats benefit the targeted population segment. These are essentially the low-income households who have no family support and no other housing options.
As $1,500 per month corresponds to the 20th percentile of household income, the current income ceiling remains appropriate. However, income ceiling is just a guide. In practice, HDB has exercised flexibility to enable some families with higher income get a public rental flat, if their circumstances are deserving of such assistance.
asked the Minister for National Development whether families with a monthly household income of $1,500 or less who have booked a 2-room HDB BTO flat and are awaiting the construction of the flats are eligible to rent a flat under the Public Rental Scheme.
: We can consider their application, but they will have to compete with other needy applicants. We will give priority to those who have no other housing option and no family support. One option is for them to rent a flat under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme, especially if they do so jointly with another family, so as to further reduce their rental expenses.
asked the Prime Minister (a) how many civil servants and statutory board officers are now above 65 years old; (b) what is the current percentage of workers who are not re-employed at 62 years old and at 65 years old respectively; and (c) what is the percentage the Government is looking at in two to three years' time.
: As at 31 December 2013
2
, there were about 139,400 public officers in service, of whom 1,400 were aged 65 years and above.
Based on our latest available annual data, from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013, about 94% of public officers who retired at age 62 and wished to continue working were re-employed. 6% (or 64 in total) were not re-employed. Amongst these officers not re-employed, about nine in 10 did not meet the qualifying criteria of having satisfactory work performance, good conduct and being medically fit to continue working. As we recently introduced our re-employment guidelines for age 65, which took effect from January 2015, the re-employment rate at age 65 would only be available later. Nevertheless, the Public Service has been re-employing officers even before this policy took effect. Of the 1,400 public officers above the age of 65, the oldest civil servant is 80 years old.
The Public Service does not set any target on the re-employment rate of public officers. If a job is available and the officer is not a poor performer or does not have medical problems, the public service agency will offer re-employment to the officer.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the rationale for requiring a foreign child adopted at birth and raised in Singapore to take an oath when the child reaches 21 years old; and (b) how does the Government consider the consequences between confirming the child's allegiance to Singapore through a mandatory oath and protecting the child from possible psychological impact as the child realises his or her adoption.
: All foreign children, whether born overseas or in Singapore, who eventually become Singapore citizens are required to take the Oath of Renunciation, Allegiance and Loyalty (ORAL) within 12 months upon reaching 21 years of age. This is required under the Constitution. The taking of the ORAL is to reaffirm the child's loyalty and is a pledge of allegiance to Singapore upon attaining adulthood.
A child who is required to take the ORAL will be notified by ICA in writing when the child reaches 21 years of age. ICA’s notification does not make any mention that the child was adopted. The process and procedure for an adopted child to take the ORAL is no different from other children who are required to do so.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs for the past five years, what is the number of heavy vehicles caught without a working speed limiter.
: All goods and public service vehicles with maximum laden weight exceeding 12 tonnes and 10 tonnes respectively are required by law to be installed with speed limiters, which restrict their maximum speed to 60 kilometres per hour.
Vehicle owners are responsible for installing and maintaining the speed limiters in working condition in their vehicles. Over the past five years, the Traffic Police has caught 20 owners for not maintaining the required speed limiters, and 37 drivers for using a vehicle with a faulty or tampered speed limiter.
asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance with the rise in the number of agencies such as the Municipal Services Office and the Smart Nation Programme Office (a) what is the expected increase in the number of civil servants over the next two years; (b) whether provisions have been made specifically to cater for public relations, especially towards customer satisfaction; and (c) how will these affect the Government's budget and what provisions have been made.
: The Government has consistently strived to maintain a lean and efficient Public Service. As at end 2014, the total staff strength of the Singapore Public Service, which includes ministries and statutory boards, was estimated at about 143,000
3
, or about 4% of our labour force
4
. This is a lower ratio than in most other countries, such as Australia (16%), Germany (11%), Switzerland (10%) and South Korea (7%)
5
.
More manpower and new units may be needed from time to time to implement new programmes or deliver enhanced services. The Government’s approach is to ensure that the manpower requirements are rightly sized, and to redeploy staff from existing functions wherever possible. This has helped to prevent over-expansion of public sector manpower over time.
In the past 10 years, the public sector workforce grew at an annual rate of about 2.5%
6
, which is lower than Singapore’s labour force growth of 4.1% per annum over the same period. We expect the growth of public sector employment to be maintained at roughly this pace over the next few years. This is because agencies need additional capacity to implement the new strategic programmes such as in healthcare services and security. It will also provide for enhancements in areas such as service delivery. The setting up of the Municipal Service Office (MSO) is one example of how we will make public services more citizen-centric.
The public sector continues to improve its efficiency and productivity, such as through greater use of IT and automation and upskilling of public officers. Over the longer term, we also have in place a Manpower Management Framework to keep public sector manpower growth at a sustainable rate in line with resident labour force growth. These measures have and will aim to keep the public sector workforce lean and manpower expenditure low.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry since the Singapore Tourism Board (Amendment) Act 2014 came into effect in October 2014, (a) what are the comments and feedback from practising tour guides with regard to the amendments; and (b) have the amendments been well understood by all stakeholders and effectively implemented to arrive at the intended outcome.
: Since the Singapore Tourism Board (Amendment) Act 2014 came into effect in October 2014, STB has actively engaged industry partners, including the Society of Tourist Guides Singapore, the NTUC Tourist Guide Chapter, travel agents and key attractions operators through regular sessions. The feedback shows that the legislative amendments have been understood and well-received by Tourist Guides. Industry players have also shared that the situation on the ground has improved, and tour groups were observed to be guided by licensed Tourist Guides.
STB has also increased its enforcement against unlicensed guides. In the three months since October 2014, when the legislative amendments came into force, STB has almost tripled the frequency of its enforcement checks from 36 to 100 a month. STB will continue to closely monitor the situation and take firm action against companies and individuals who do not comply with the regulatory requirements.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Ministry will consider implementing an Autonomous Vehicle or Electric Vehicle trial at Jurong Island whereby such vehicles can be used as a mode of transportation to ferry users from the checkpoint to and from their workplaces located within the island to improve transport options within Jurong Island.
: Under the Committee on Autonomous Road Transport for Singapore (CARTS), the Government is studying the safety, regulatory and liability frameworks for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on public roads and spaces, and carrying out research and test-bedding of AV technology and concepts in Singapore. There are also pilots for Electric Vehicles (EVs), including an EV car sharing test-bed conducted by EDB and LTA.
Areas with heavy industrial activities like Jurong Island (JI) are less suitable for testing such vehicles, due to the high volume of heavy vehicle traffic and hazardous cargo transportation.
MTI and JTC are working with MOT and LTA to enhance public transport to JI and improve the service quality of bus operators within the island. Longer term infrastructure, such as the Jurong Region Line, is also being developed which will further improve public transport options in the western parts of Singapore.
asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Department of Statistics can publish income and expenditure statistics by individuals in addition to by households so as to provide more precise measurements on poverty since individuals in a household may have different access to the household income.
: The Department of Statistics provides detailed statistics on households’ monthly expenditure and income based on the Household Expenditure Survey (HES).
Data from the HES is analysed on a household basis, and not on an individual basis, to reflect the sharing of goods and services as well as income resources within the household. Many expenditure items including food, utilities and household goods are shared among members of a household, and it would not be feasible to attribute a specific share of the household’s expenditure on each item to individual household members. In addition, income resources are commonly pooled to support household members who are not earning an income, such as children, the elderly or a non-working spouse. Similar to the case for expenditure, it would be difficult to ascertain how much income resources each household member has consumed.
The use of the household as the basic unit of analysis for the HES is in accordance with international best practices recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and is also adopted by other national statistical offices such as those in Australia, Hong Kong and the United States.
asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether there are plans to have the National Library and its branches open for longer hours for a start and progressively to 24 hours.
: Public libraries in standalone buildings operate from 10.00 am to 9.00 pm daily, while those in shopping malls operate from 11.00 am to 9.00 pm daily in line with the mall operating hours. NLB’s data show that visitorship tapers off significantly in the final hour to closing time. Similarly, the first hour of opening also sees modest visitorship. While NLB recognises there could be a small group of library users who would appreciate extended operating hours, the current usage patterns do not suggest there would be significant demand for it.
Besides the physical libraries, NLB provides a collection of over three million e-Books. These can be accessed anytime. Over the last five years, usage of NLB’s electronic content has grown substantially, attesting to their growing popularity with library users. Many users who visit our libraries regularly are also active users of our electronic services and content.
There are, therefore, no plans for NLB to extend its branch operating hours.
asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can consider waiving car park charges for HDB car parks on Saturdays since it is generally a non-working day for many Singaporeans.
: There are trade-offs between the interests of residents and those of visiting motorists. HDB car parks are provided primarily to cater to the parking needs of residents. The current Free Parking Scheme (FPS) covers Sundays and Public Holidays. Extending the FPS to Saturdays will result in residents having to also compete with visitors for parking lots on Saturdays, too. On balance, HDB prefers to maintain the status quo and has no plans to extend free parking to Saturdays.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of vets in Singapore currently; (b) whether this number is sufficient in serving the current animal population; and (c) what is the proportion of vets offering general veterinary services versus specialised care.
: There are 304 veterinarians licensed by the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority. Among them, 219 are in small animal practice, looking after pet animals such as dogs and cats. The rest are in other establishments such as research institutes, wildlife attractions and equine establishments.
One common indicator to assess the sufficiency of veterinary services is the veterinarian-pet ratio. A study by the World Society for the Protection of Animals showed that Singapore’s ratio was comparable to that of the United Kingdom and the United States of America
The vast majority of our veterinarians offer general veterinary services. Only four have obtained specialist recognition in the fields of small animal surgery, canine medicine and ophthalmology. Some vet centres in Singapore may on occasion invite visiting consultants to offer other specialised services such as cardiac surgeries.
asked the Minister for National Development whether there is a coordinated national plan to preserve (i) open green spaces, green belts and green lungs in Singapore; and (ii) the nature and rustic feel of the smaller surrounding islands such as Pulau Ubin.
: Greening has always been a key strategy in our planning and development of Singapore. This is because we see the value of greenery in improving the quality of life for our people. It also beautifies our city. Implementing it requires a whole-of-government approach. Planning for greenery is, therefore, a closely coordinated effort involving multiple agencies.
Today, we have set aside close to a tenth of our land for Nature Reserves and parks. For a small nation, this is a significant commitment. Given our land constraints, we have sought practical and innovative solutions to safeguard sufficient green spaces and integrate greenery and biodiversity into our urban environment. These comprise our Nature Reserves, Nature Areas, parks, Park Connectors, street-side planting, greenery along our waterways and skyrise greenery. Green spaces are safeguarded in the Parks and Waterbodies Plan under Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Master Plan.
In the 2014 Master Plan, a key focus is to provide more green spaces and to improve accessibility to them. To enhance liveability, we aim to have 90% of our residents living within 400 metres of a park by 2030. To enable our residents to enjoy the benefits of nature, we will be developing 180 kilometres of Nature Ways and 400 kilometres of Park Connectors, including 150 kilometres of the Round Island Route, by 2030. The Rail Corridor will be retained as a continuous green corridor and public space that connect people and places. We will also be adding new nature parks with lush vegetation, and these include Chestnut Nature Park, Windsor Nature Park and Thomson Nature Park.
We also value the natural heritage of our coastal and marine areas. We have set up the Sisters’ Islands Marine Park for the public to enjoy the rich marine life there. Plans are ongoing to establish Coney Island as a rustic regional park with recreational facilities amidst rehabilitated coastal beach vegetation. Under "The Ubin Project", various agencies are working closely with and consulting the public extensively on ways to enhance Pulau Ubin’s natural and rustic charm for future generations. Several initiatives, such as shoreline restoration, habitat enhancement, species recovery, and a new centre for education and research will be progressively implemented over the next few years.
asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry can consider preserving (i) the green corridor that spans from the Bukit Timah railway station to the foothills of Bukit Timah for nature lovers and exercise enthusiasts; and (ii) the green belt along Old Holland Road where the deepening of the tributary canal is presently taking place.
: The stretch of green space between the Bukit Timah railway station and the foothills of Bukit Timah is part of the Rail Corridor, which once held the Malayan Railway track. We are actively engaging Singaporeans on how the Rail Corridor can be developed as a unique public space that connects people and communities, including nature lovers and exercise enthusiasts. In other stretches of the Rail Corridor, where large areas of adjoining land are suitable for development, we will nevertheless preserve a continuous green corridor from the Woodlands Railway Station to the former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station.
As for the stretch along Old Holland Road where the deepening of the tributary canal is taking place, it is not part of the Rail Corridor. It abuts mainly residential land. We have plans to replant trees along the northern bank of the canal after the canal has been widened. We are also studying how a park connector along the southern banks of the canal can be provided.
While both these areas are still subject to detailed study and planning, the agencies will work together to ensure that any future developments will be integrated with green spaces.
asked the Minister for National Development (a) when do new BTO flat owners have to begin paying the service/conservancy charges; (b) what is the rationale for the time of commencement of this payment; and (c) whether there can be a waiver or reduction of the service/conservancy charges during the interim period when the flat is unoccupied.
: Owners of new Build-to-Order (BTO) flats will begin paying the service & conservancy charges (S&CC) to their Town Councils from the day they complete their flat purchase and collect the keys to their new flat. This is because this is the date that they assume complete ownership of the flat. Prior to key collection, HDB pays for the S&CC for the vacant completed units.
Under the Town Councils Act, Town Councils are empowered to vary the S&CC from time to time, or remit or refund the charges in whole or in part. Town Councils can decide if the S&CC can be waived or reduced during the period when the flat remains unoccupied. However, if the Town Council does so, residents of occupied flats would effectively be subsidising the unoccupied flats.
asked the Minister for National Development in view of the challenging property market conditions, whether HDB will consider extending the period a HDB homeowner is required to sell off his existing flat upon taking possession of his new HDB flat from six months to one year.
: The six-month period is generally sufficient for flat owners to arrange for the sale of their existing flat, as they renovate their new flats and move in. This is especially if they start planning once they book a new flat. For those who need more time to sell their flats due to special circumstances, HDB will assess each request based on the merits of the case.
asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is the current breakdown of the number of graduates and non-graduates who are commissioned as officers at the point of their commissioning; and (b) whether junior college Basic Military Training (BMT) batches have more officer placements than non-Junior College BMT batches.
: Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) are selected for leadership positions based on the operational and manpower requirements of the Singapore Armed Forces, as well as the suitability of the individual based on his expressed interest, medical fitness, aptitude and performance during Basic Military Training (BMT).
The majority of officers are selected and commissioned from among NSFs with A-levels or Polytechnic diplomas prior to their university education. Of those with A-levels and who are combat fit, about 11-13% were commissioned as officers in the last three years. Of those with Polytechnic diplomas, the corresponding figure over the same period is 10-14%.
asked the Minister for Health with the introduction of the Regional Health Systems, what is the progress and plan for the integration of healthcare from primary to tertiary care, step-down, intermediate to long-term care, and community-based care.
: The Regional Health Systems (RHS) have been established with the aim of developing and strengthening partnerships across care providers in the region, both private and public, and across care settings – tertiary, primary and community care, to deliver integrated care to our population. The RHSes have embarked on several programmes, ranging from preventive health, to management of chronic diseases, to caring for frail patients.
For preventive health, the RHSes have actively moved into the community in partnership with community organisations to conduct health screenings as well as programmes to help residents embark on a healthier lifestyle. In Taman Jurong for example, Juronghealth System has partnered the grassroots to reach out to and recruit residents for health screening, and linked up with Lakeside Family Medicine Clinic to provide subsequent patient follow-up services. Over 12,000 residents have benefitted from this and other similar programmes.
In terms of chronic disease management, RHSes have made efforts to integrate care between specialist outpatient clinics and primary care providers to better care for patients in the community. A good example is the partnership between Frontier Family Medicine Clinic (FMC) and the National University Hospital (NUH). Supported by data linkages, Frontier FMC’s primary care physicians can access appropriate patient information from NUH to facilitate shared care to patients. Overall, this results in fewer appointments, more integrated care for the patient, and savings for the system as a whole. Over 2,000 patients have benefited under this and similar arrangements thus far.
The RHSes are also paying more attention to frail patients by helping them manage and monitor their chronic or complex conditions, and to improve their health awareness and capability to take care of themselves. Under Khoo Teck Puat Hospital’s Ageing-In-Place (AIP) programme, community nurses are deployed to the patients’ homes to manage and monitor their conditions. These nurses also serve as the single point of contact to patients by coordinating healthcare services such as home and medical care, and specialists appointments, as well as non-medical services such as befriending, wellness, and home help. Over 3,000 patients have benefitted from AIP and similar programmes island-wide.
We will continue to work closely with partners in the healthcare and social care in the community, and monitor the results of the various initiatives. We will learn from these initiatives and refine our healthcare service delivery models to better address patients’ needs in a cost-effective manner.
asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the number of children suffering from eczema in Singapore in the past five years; (b) whether the number of such cases has increased; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider including eczema as a claimable medical condition under the chronic disease subsidy scheme.
: The Ministry of Health does not routinely track the total number of children with eczema in Singapore. Between 2010 and 2013, about 1% of children below 16 years of age attended our polyclinics and public sector specialist clinics for eczema each year, but others may have been treated by GPs or specialists in the private sector.
The Medisave for Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) was introduced in 2006 to improve outpatient chronic disease management through evidence-based structured Disease Management Programmes. Medisave may be used to pay for outpatient treatment of conditions covered under the CDMP which helps patients to reduce their out-of-pocket payments.
The coverage of CDMP has been expanded over the years and now covers 15 common chronic conditions. These conditions were selected based on various considerations, such as disease prevalence and effectiveness of early intervention to reduce complications. The selection criteria continue to be refined to better meet the healthcare needs of patients, while bearing in mind the need to ensure sufficient Medisave balances to meet our lifetime healthcare needs.
There is currently no plan to include eczema in the CDMP. Subsidies for eczema treatment are widely available for all Singaporeans at the polyclinics and subsidised specialist outpatient clinics (SOCs), and for lower- to middle-income Singaporeans at GP clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). Singaporeans with difficulties managing their medical bills despite government subsidies can also approach the Medical Social Workers (MSWs) at the public institutions for assistance.
asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current number of educational sponsorships offered to (i) nurses (ii) social workers and (iii) occupational therapists; (b) what is the training allowance for each of these professions; and (c) whether the training allowances will be further raised and, if so, when.
: The Ministry of Health provides funding for a range of healthcare scholarships and educational sponsorships to develop healthcare professionals and leaders. These scholarships and sponsorships include formal training programmes leading to diplomas, degrees, masters and doctorates as well as skills attachment programmes in renowned overseas centres. The scholarships and sponsorships cover tuition fees, maintenance expenses, miscellaneous training-related costs and salaries.
Over the past five years, the Ministry of Health and the public healthcare sector awarded more than 1,000 healthcare sponsorships to nurses, medical social workers and occupational therapists. In FY2014 alone, there were about 200 such awards.
MOH regularly reviews the scholarships and programmes to ensure that the terms and benefits remain adequate, and the areas of training are aligned with our healthcare needs.
asked the Minister for Health how does the Ministry (i) encourage synergy between all mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors; (ii) ensure that patients diagnosed with mental illness are followed up on especially if they choose not to return to IMH for follow-up treatment; and (iii) work with employers and insurance companies to encourage the use of medical benefits for employees to offset the cost of mental health counselling or therapy.
: To encourage synergy between mental health professionals, both our public hospitals and mental health teams in the community adopt a multidisciplinary approach. For example, each patient admitted is assigned a lead clinician who will lead the delivery of care, supported by a team-based system comprising other doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals where appropriate. The multidisciplinary approach has enabled specialists and allied health professionals to work closely together.
For patients who have higher needs and require closer follow-up, IMH has put in place a post-discharge programme to ensure that these patients comply with follow-up treatment through telephonic case management, and home visits when necessary.
To ensure that patients are supported in the community, AIC has worked with VWOs, Social Agencies and Grassroots organisations to manage and care for people with mental health issues. These community programmes provide clinical care, psychotherapy, education and support for both the patients and caregivers. They complement the hospital teams in outreach to them within the community setting, and conduct home visits for these patients where necessary. Over the last two years, these programmes have benefitted over 18,000 clients, caregivers and community partners.
In terms of affordability, MOH had enhanced MediShield coverage from 1 March 2013 to cover inpatient treatment of psychiatric conditions. Most Integrated Shield Plans also provide enhanced coverage for such treatment, on top of MediShield. In addition, Medisave can be used for the outpatient treatment of bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety.
HPB also provides a workplace health promotion grant for employers to implement mental health and well-being related initiatives for their employees. In FY14, 718 workplaces have taken up this grant benefitting an estimated 150,000 employees. More than 80% of these workplaces have invested at least 30% of their grant on providing services, such as phone or face-to-face counselling, psychological assessment and interventions.
asked the Minister for Health (a) what strategies are being employed to promote public awareness of advance care planning and end-of-life issues; and (b) what short-term and long-term measures are in place to boost numbers and skill level of manpower, especially local manpower, for the palliative care sector.
: MOH recognises the importance of end-of-life issues, such as Advance Care Planning (ACP) and palliative care services, in supporting the needs of our ageing population. We are working comprehensively to raise awareness of these issues.
We partner community organisations to reach out to the general public on end-of-life issues in the heartlands. For instance, MOH recently supported the Both Sides Now campaign organised by Lien Foundation and Ang Chin Moh Foundation. The mobile art exhibitions and performances gave visitors an opportunity to reflect and share about the topics of living and dying. We also supported the Singapore Hospice Council’s three-year Community Outreach Programme, which aims to share with the general public about palliative care services through grassroots events and outreach activities.
The Agency for Integrated Care is working with Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) providers in the community care and social care sectors to train their staff and volunteers to be advocates of ACP. These advocates will introduce the idea of ACP to clients and their families in the community, to raise awareness of ACP. We have also trained more than 1,000 healthcare professionals as ACP facilitators to guide patients and their families in discussions on end-of-life and ACP issues.
To support the increase in demand for inpatient and home palliative care services, we aim to double the number of doctors, nurses and medical social workers in the palliative care sector from around 150 in 2012 to 300 by 2020. We plan to do so through three main areas.
Firstly, we have enhanced the funding model for home palliative care from 1 July 2014 to give providers greater certainty in planning ahead, including recruiting additional manpower to expand their services.
Secondly, we are also supporting efforts to enhance the training of our family physicians in palliative care. The Division of Graduate Medical Studies at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine launched a Graduate Diploma in Palliative Medicine for doctors last year. The course trains doctors, especially family physicians, to better deliver palliative care to patients both in the clinic and home settings.
Lastly, to help with the retention of staff, MOH has also rolled out several initiatives across the Intermediate and Long Term Care (ILTC) sector, such as funding MOH-subvented providers, to raise staff salaries, and enhancing subsidies to support the training and development of staff.
With these initiatives, we have seen the number of doctors, nurses and medical social workers in the sector increase by a third between 2012 and 2014, from 150 to 205. We will continue to monitor the growth of manpower in the palliative care sector to ensure that palliative care services are able to grow as planned to serve our ageing population.
asked the Minister for Transport (a) what are the criteria for classifying roads as private roads; and (b) what are the conditions for converting private roads to public roads and vice-versa.
: Under the Street Works Act, a public street refers to any street where the general public has right of way and it is vested in the Government. All other streets are private streets.
Private streets can be converted to public streets upon request by the owner or otherwise, provided that the physical conditions of the road and its design meet the Land Transport Authority (LTA)’s requirements for public streets, and the LTA assesses that conversion is beneficial for the general public.
The Street Works Act also provides for public streets to be converted to private streets. Such applications are typically made by private developers or property owners, for example, to amalgamate a public street with adjacent private land for redevelopment, and are assessed by the LTA on a case-by-case basis.
asked the Minister for Transport what is the current breakdown of the number of vehicles, including cars and motorbikes, plying Singapore roads according to the vehicle speed limit.
: The requested information is provided in the table below:
asked the Minister for Transport what are the measures imposed on MRT train operators to ensure that there are no security breaches at the train depot.
: The incident of vandalism that occurred on 5 May 2014 is still being investigated, and details cannot be disclosed at this juncture. As for the incident on 8 November 2014, the Police announced on 21 November 2014 the arrest of two German nationals. Further details cannot be disclosed as the trial is ongoing.
Following the incidents, Land Transport Authority (LTA) had directed both operators to review their security measures and to take immediate steps to remedy any gaps and vulnerabilities found within the depots. Amongst others, SMRT has secured the potential entry points via the drainage system, and further enhanced its security patrols. LTA has also reminded the two operators to ensure that pre-operation checks of both train interiors and exteriors continue to be conducted prior to their launch for service in the morning.
The Ministry takes a serious view of security breaches. LTA, as the chair of the Public Transport Security Committee, is working with the relevant agencies and the public transport operators to review the security of all our train depots, as well as other critical infrastructure in the public transport system. Specifically for MRT depots, LTA’s Code of Practice sets out the baseline security standards with which PTOs are expected to comply, such as specifications for the perimeter fencing, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) surveillance, and the lighting of the depot. To further enhance the security of the MRT network, LTA intends to introduce new security-related standards within the Operating Performance Standards (OPS) which all operators are required to meet under their existing licences. If the operators do not comply with the OPS, they can be penalised up to $1 million, or 10% of the licencee’s annual fare revenue of the affected rail system, whichever is higher.
asked the Minister for Transport what is the rationale for the fee of S$1,300 for vehicle owners to retain and reuse their existing car licence plate numbers and whether the Ministry will consider reducing or waiving the amount.
: The Land Transport Authority provides system-generated vehicle registration numbers at no cost to vehicle owners. Most vehicle owners accept these numbers. However, those who wish to choose their own vehicle registration numbers have the option of doing so and are levied a fee for the option.
Owners can bid for a new vehicle registration number at a minimum bid of $1,000 and use it on an existing vehicle with a replacement fee of $300. Alternatively, an owner can use a registration number from another vehicle, including the vehicle which he owned previously. In both instances, the numbers are of the owners’ choice. The fees for using a registration number from an existing vehicle is, therefore, set at the same level as the minimum cost of using a bid number, which is $1,300.
asked the Minister for Transport with regard to the recent infiltrations of SMRT's Bishan train depot (a) what are the findings of the investigations into the intrusions; and (b) what measures have been put in place to prevent further intrusions.
: Please refer to the answer provided for Mr Lim Biow Chuan’s earlier question [please refer to Question 23], which also addresses Mr David Ong’s concerns regarding the findings of the investigations and the measures put in place to prevent further intrusions.
asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry has any plans to regulate private tuition teachers and tuition agencies; and (b) what mechanisms are in place for dispute resolution between these tuition teachers and agencies, and their consumers.
: Under the Education Act, centres offering tuition or enrichment programmes with 10 or more students must be registered with MOE. This does not include private tuition teachers or tuition agencies. If disputes between such parties and their consumers cannot be resolved mutually, consumers may consider mechanisms such as mediation, lodging a complaint through Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), the Small Claims Tribunal, or seeking legal assistance in the matter, depending on the nature and details of each dispute.
Currently, there are no plans to regulate private tuition teachers or tuition agencies. Parents and students should exercise their discretion and carry out basic checks before engaging them, such as checking the credentials of tutors.
asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the Ministry doing to ensure that the degrees offered by private educational institutions are on par with degree programmes offered by our local universities; (b) what is the value of an institution passing an audit by the Council for Private Education for a licence; and (c) whether the Ministry co-ordinates with the Public Service Division in the Prime Minister's Office to ensure that the degrees issued by these institutions meet the requirements of the Singapore Civil Service.
: The private education landscape is diverse, and there is varying quality among private education courses and providers. One of the aims of the Council for Private Education (CPE)’s regulatory framework is to protect the interests of students, by ensuring minimum standards in corporate and academic governance, strengthening student fee protection measures, and requiring private education institutions (PEIs) to disclose key information on courses and teachers, so that students can make more informed choices. However, registration by CPE is not an endorsement or accreditation of the academic quality of programmes offered by PEIs. Hence, there is no guarantee that degrees from PEIs are of the same quality as the degrees offered by our local, publicly-funded universities.
Given the diversity of qualifications and experiences of students, the range of programmes that are offered by PEIs and the diverse requirements of employers, it is difficult to have a central authority that assesses or accords recognition to degrees for employment purposes. For external degree programmes (EDPs), CPE’s role is to safeguard the interests of students and the public by ensuring that EDPs meet certain minimum threshold standards, as regulations for degree-awarding institutions differ from country to country. Some factors which CPE considers include the accreditation status of the awarding institution, the track record of the awarding institution, and whether the EDPs offered are subject to the same academic assurance processes as the programmes offered in the home campuses.
As we move towards a society that places stronger emphasis on the mastery of skills, PEIs should ensure that students attain skills that are valuable to industry, and that will enable them to advance in their careers based on their skills. This may require a re-orientation for some segments of the PEI sector, to ensure that programmes offered are industry-relevant, beneficial to students, and help graduates achieve good employment outcomes.
Individuals on their part need to exercise care, and acquire all the necessary information before making decisions about their education pathways. Otherwise, the time, effort, and money invested may not produce the expected returns.
asked the Minister for Education over the past five years, what is the average number of students exempted from taking mother tongue language at the Primary School Leaving Examination in the five schools with the highest number of such exemptions.
: Over the past five years, the average number of students given MTL exemption in the five schools with the highest number of exemption cases is 178.
asked the Minister for Education for each of the years from 2012 to 2014, what is the number and percentage of foreigners and permanent residents attending our public schools, broken down by primary school, secondary school, ITE, junior college and tertiary institution.
: The vast majority of students across our publicly-funded schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) are Singaporeans.
Having international students (IS) benefits Singaporeans. First, the diversity of students from different backgrounds adds vibrancy to the campus, and enhances global awareness and cross-cultural skills that prepares Singaporean students for the global market place of the future, where such soft skills will matter. Second, by augmenting our labour force, we ease the shortage in our labour market and make it easier for companies to continue to invest in Singapore to create good jobs for Singaporeans. Third, the reservoir of goodwill, friendship and trust generated among those who study here enable Singaporeans to form strong ties with them and expand opportunities for Singaporeans in the future.
Out of the total enrolment in our national schools (Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and Junior Colleges), around 9% are PRs and another 5% are IS.
At the tertiary level, in each year, IS make up around 1% of the Institute of Technical Education’s (ITE) intake, around 10% of the Polytechnics’ intake, and around 15% of the Autonomous Universities’ (AUs) intake. PRs make up another 3-5% of the cohort.
asked the Minister for Manpower as at 2014, what is the breakdown for Singaporeans and permanent residents and foreigners who are professionals, managers and executives in Singapore in terms of the 25th, 50th, 60th, 70th, 75th and 80th percentile of the (i) basic salary (including and excluding employer CPF contributions); and (ii) gross salary (including and excluding employer CPF contributions).
: The breakdown of gross monthly income from work by percentiles as at June 2013, for full-time employed residents and Singapore Citizens who are Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) is provided in Table 1. Comparable data are only available for gross monthly income and residents and Singaporeans.
As compared to Singaporean PMEs, the gross monthly income of resident PMEs is higher since Permanent Residents typically have to display good employability before they are granted residency.
asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many CPF members have not made a nomination; and (b) whether there are new or enhanced efforts to encourage them to do so.
: When a CPF member passes away without making a nomination, his CPF monies will be distributed by the Public Trustee in the same way as the distribution of his other assets in situations where the deceased did not leave a will; that is, as specified in the Intestate Succession Act. Distribution by the Public Trustee safeguards the welfare of his immediate family members. For example, if the deceased is single, his CPF savings will be distributed by the Public Trustee equally between his parents. If he is married, his spouse will receive half of his CPF savings, and his children will share the remaining half. For Muslims, their CPF savings will be distributed by the Public Trustee according to the Administration of Muslim Law Act in a slightly different manner, but the beneficiaries remain the deceased member’s immediate family members.
Should the member wish to distribute his CPF savings differently, the CPF Board’s nomination scheme provides him with an option to specify the recipients of his CPF savings upon demise, and how much each recipient should receive. As of 30 September 2014, about 50% of all CPF members aged 16 and above had not made a nomination.
For distribution through CPF Board’s nomination scheme and by the Public Trustee, monies are generally distributed within four weeks from the date of receipt of the full set of required documents from the deceased member’s beneficiaries.
CPF Board provides comprehensive information on the distribution of CPF savings by the Public Trustee, as well as CPF Board’s nomination scheme, via a webcast on the CPF Board website. Members can also call the CPF Board hotline at 1800-227-1188 or approach staff at CPF Board’s service centres directly to find out more. If members are uncertain about whether they have already made a nomination, they can check their annual statement of account.
asked the Minister for Manpower from 2011 to 2014 (a) what is the age breakdown of successful applicants for the Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) for (i) nurses (ii) social workers and (iii) occupational therapists; and (b) how many of the successful applicants are unemployed at the time of application for the PCP.
: The Singapore Workforce Development Agency’s (WDA)’s Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) are aimed at helping workers to undergo the skills conversion needed to fill positions at the Professionals, Managers and Executives (PME) level in industries where employers have identified critical manpower needs.
Between 2011 and 2014, more than 230 applicants were successfully enrolled into the Healthcare and Social Work PCPs, which includes that for registered nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, diagnostic radiographers and social workers. About 10% of these successfully enrolled applicants were unemployed at the point of application and 30% were aged 35 and above.
asked the Minister for Manpower given a recent instance of a foreign worker being repatriated for a Dependency Ratio Ceiling violation whereby the ruling was subsequently reversed on appeal but the foreign worker was not able to return as a work permit holder, what provisions are in place to ensure processing of appeals prior to repatriation or to allow for the reversibility of rulings post-repatriation.
: Business employers are required to keep within their Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) when hiring foreign workers. The DRC is calculated based on the company’s local workforce, as reflected via its CPF contributions to its employees. When a company reduces its local workforce or fails to make its CPF contributions on time, its Dependency Ratio will exceed the DRC.
MOM will then request the company to rectify the situation by either increasing its local workforce or cancelling some work passes so as to keep within the DRC. In such instances, employers are given a choice as to which work pass holders to retain and which to let go. Employers are given ample opportunity to take remedial action before MOM cancels any work passes. We will also take in appeals from employers if the situation is rectified before the workers are sent home. Employers may still re-hire the workers if they have sufficient room within their DRC.
To avoid unnecessary disruption to business operations, employers should ensure that they maintain sufficient local workers to keep within its DRC.
