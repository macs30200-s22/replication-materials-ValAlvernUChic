            ": Mr Speaker, if I may continue. Let me start by explaining the background of the site and development. The former Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) railway line used to run through the Kranji Road/Kranji Close site. When the KTM land was returned to Singapore in 2011, the said site comprised mainly disused scrubland. This is shown on page 3 of the handout.",
            "As the site was earmarked for future development works, it was left vacant. More non-native Albizia trees then sprouted over the years. In 2015, following URA’s review of the plans for the KTM land parcels, the Rail Corridor was realigned out of the Kranji parcel so that the site could be redeveloped for industrial use. The plan was publicly exhibited, and community stakeholders were generally receptive to the proposal. This is shown in page 6 of the handout.",
            "The site was later earmarked for the development of the Agri-Food Innovation Park (AFIP) as part of the larger Sungei Kadut Eco-District (SKED) development, which will support Singapore’s 30-by-30 food security goals. In its development plans for the AFIP, JTC recognised the importance of retaining greenery, and therefore proposed to preserve the original alignment of the former KTM railway line within AFIP as a green corridor with additional green buffers on each side. JTC’s development plans for AFIP with the green corridor were publicly exhibited in URA’s Draft Master Plan 2019 and the SKED Master Plan exhibition in February 2020.",
            "I will now go through the development works at the Kranji site. In response to Ms He Ting Ru’s question, page 9 of the handout provides a background on the roles and responsibilities of the various parties involved in a typical development project, including that of AFIP. Besides the contractor, an important party is the consultant, who acts as the Qualified Person (QP). In particular, the QP is responsible for ensuring that the project’s design meet the statutory requirements, and obtaining approvals from the authorities for the design.",
            "Mr Seah Kian Peng, Mr Xie Yao Quan and Mr Dennis Tan have asked about the sequence of land clearing activities. JTC’s chronology has been reported widely in the media, and Members may refer to pages 10 to 15 of the handout for the chronology. I will therefore just highlight a few key points.",
            "In 2019, JTC appointed CPG as its consultant to carry out planning and design works for the site. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was not required then, given that the site was previously dominated by scrubland vegetation and later non-native Albizia trees as I had explained earlier. The site is also not close to sensitive nature areas.",
            "Thereafter, CPG submitted building plans for AFIP to NParks, including proposals to fell trees. On 29 August 2019, NParks issued a Written Direction to approve the tree-felling for three plots within the site, namely Plots 4, 5 and 9 indicated on page 11 of the handout. Following this, tree felling for Plot 9 started in March 2020.",
            "In August 2020, CPG submitted updated building plans to NParks, which included a new drain with discharge and flow into Sungei Pang Sua.",
            "As the drain could potentially cause sediments from the site to flow into Sungei Pang Sua and impact wildlife in the vicinity, NParks instructed JTC and CPG to conduct a fauna baseline study and Environmental Monitoring and Management Programme (EMMP). The consultant for the fauna study and EMMP was engaged in December 2020.",
            "Between end December 2020 and 13 January 2021, the contractor conducted further clearing without approval. These areas are edged red in page 14 of the handout and amount to a total of 4.5 hectares.",
            "There are on-going investigations on why the contractor did so, since there was no approval. I seek the House’s understanding that I cannot say more at this point in time, pending the outcome of these investigations.",
            "The further land clearing by the contractor was discovered by JTC’s project manager on 13 January 2021 during his site visit. All clearance works onsite were suspended immediately and remain suspended today.",
            "Mr Xie Yao Quan and Ms He Ting Ru asked how we will ensure such incidents do not recur. JTC has commenced an internal investigation to ascertain what had happened and why. The investigation will be led by JTC’s Senior Management who are not involved in the project. It will check if JTC’s current processes for land clearance works were followed by both the public officers and private contractors involved. JTC will also review how it can better supervise the various personnel involved in its development projects. NParks is separately investigating whether there were breaches to the Parks and Trees Act and the Wildlife Act. We will not comment further on the respective investigations at this point to not prejudice the outcomes.",
            "Till today, all clearance works on the Kranji Close/Kranji Road site remain suspended. After the fauna baseline study and EMMP are completed around April 2021, JTC will engage key stakeholders, including nature interest groups, to discuss its development plans. Findings of the studies will be made publicly available when ready.",
            "We can and must do better. As Minister-in-charge of the Public Service, I have instructed all agencies involved in land clearance projects to conduct an immediate check to ensure their project supervision and implementation processes are in order. Minister Desmond Lee and I have also asked Permanent Secretary Joseph Leong, who is not involved in this matter, to lead a review of the lessons arising from this development at Kranji. In the course of his review, he will consult representatives from the public, private and people sectors. The outcomes from the various investigations and review will be shared with the public when ready.",
            "Mr Speaker, let me conclude by summarising the key points: the said piece of land was meant for industrial development. It was scrubland that has become overgrown in recent years. In developing this piece of land to strengthen our food supply chain resilience, JTC and NParks had on their own accord proposed retaining the original alignment of the former railway line to preserve its heritage, with a green corridor that would provide an ecological connection between Sungei Pang Sua and Sungei Mandai. The project was carefully planned, incorporating and balancing the considerations of economic development, job creation and environmental protection.",
            "The execution of the land clearing could be improved. That is the subject of on-going investigations. We should not speculate or prematurely apportion blame without a full understanding of the timeline of events, scope of responsibilities of the various parties involved and the motivations of various parties or pressures faced that could have contributed to the outcome. We will investigate the pertinent issues thoroughly, share the lessons learnt and improve as a system."

            "As the details of the site clearance at the Kranji site have been shared publicly by JTC at a press conference on 22 February, I will focus my response today on: (a) environmental considerations in the planning process, (b) on-going investigations into the incident at the Kranji site, and (c) steps that we plan to take to strengthen our processes, including the EIA framework.",
            "Let me start with the planning process.",
            "Under URA’s Planning Act, development proposals require planning permission from URA before they are allowed to proceed. As part of this process, every development proposal goes through a thorough screening process, which reviews not only its potential environmental impact, but also other aspects such as its impact on traffic, public health and heritage.",
            "Developments projects that: (a) are near sensitive areas such as Nature Reserves, Nature Areas and other areas with significant biodiversity; or (b) which are in marine and coastal areas; or (c) which have potential trans-boundary impact, are subject to greater scrutiny. The developers of such projects will be required to undergo an in-depth consultation process with relevant Technical Agencies, namely NParks, National Environment Agency (NEA), the Maritime Port Authority (MPA) and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA).",
            "Depending on the context of the site, the scope of the project works, and its potential impact on the environment, more detailed studies may be required. This can be an Environmental Baseline Study (EBS), or in some cases, a more detailed Environmental Impact Study (EIS), which sets out the environmental baseline, expected impact and mitigation measures.",
            "The studies enable agencies to better assess the possible environmental impact of the development plans and the adequacy of the proposed mitigation measures, to guide the planning and potential development of the site. For instance, NEA assesses the potential for noise, water or air pollution, MPA assesses impacts on navigation and SFA on sea-based farms, NParks assesses impacts on terrestrial and marine biodiversity, covering both flora and fauna.",
            "We adopt this calibrated approach across all development projects, whether they are for industrial or other uses.",
            "While developers can call tenders for works while the environmental studies are on-going, activities on site can only proceed when the developer has received the necessary approvals from relevant agencies. This applies for both private and public projects.",
            "Let me give an example of site clearance which involves the felling of trees. Under the Parks and Trees Act, the felling of any tree more than one metre in girth either on vacant land or in Tree Conservation areas can only proceed with the Commissioner's approval. NParks will require a tree survey, in order to assess the potential impact of the tree felling plan. If NParks assesses that conducting a further environmental baseline, or other forms of study, is not required, it may allow for some types of works to begin. However, NParks may require mitigation measures, such as the installation of hoarding or an Environmental Monitoring and Management Programme (EMMP) to be in place.",
            "For past incidents of tree felling without prior approval, NParks had conducted investigations and penalties ensued. The environmental impact of such incidents varies depending on the site context and the extent of works undertaken.",
            "Planning permission for the project to go ahead is only granted after a project has met the requirements imposed by the respective regulatory agencies. These include completing necessary detailed technical studies, such as environmental and traffic impact assessments, as well as putting in place mitigating measures.",
            "Let me move on to the clearance of this Kranji site. Many Members have asked for updates on the investigations and the possible penalties on the site clearance at Kranji site.",
            "As I have said on 22 February, in the press conference, NParks is currently investigating whether there had been breaches of the Wildlife Act and/or the Parks and Trees Act. We therefore cannot go into more detail at this point, and we ask that Members not speculate further. After investigations are complete, NParks will refer the case to the Public Prosecutor for directions, before sharing the findings with the public.",
            "There are penalties for breaches of the Parks and Trees Act and the Wildlife Act. For instance, infringement of the Wildlife Act that came into force in June last year, may attract a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment up to six months, or both.",
            "Members have also asked if the site clearance at the Kranji Road/Kranji Close s",
            "ite had affected the fauna baseline study. Thirteen hectares of vegetated areas, which includes the safeguarded green corridor and vegetated buffers along Sungei Pang Sua, remain. All clearance works onsite are currently suspended, while the study is underway. The results of the study will be made public when ready. Thereafter, JTC will engage relevant stakeholders on the findings, including the measures to enhance the greenery and connectivity of the site and its surrounding environs. The study findings will be used to design measures such as enhanced habitats, buffers and connectivity for wildlife.",
            "Now, I move on to the third part of the presentation which is on steps to strengthen processes. Members have asked how we will seek to prevent such incidents from happening again. As Minister Chan Chun Sing had announced on Monday, a review will be undertaken of this incident, to identify gaps and learning points for project management, supervision and execution, as well as inter-agency coordination. Agencies involved in site clearance projects are conducting checks to ensure that their project supervision and implementation processes are in order.",
            "In parallel, MND will continue our efforts to strengthen the Environmental Impact Assessment, or EIA, framework, in close consultation with the nature community and partner agencies. We are currently working to implement the following enhancements which we had announced publicly last October, namely: (a) increase the vigour or rigour of our environmental studies through a set of Biodiversity Impact Assessment Guidelines; (b) strengthen our enforcement regime through the amended Wildlife Act; (c) build up local expertise on ecological matters; and (d) make all environmental study reports publicly available, unless there are security considerations.",
            "In our discussions with the nature community last year, we had identified several other ways to further strengthen the EIA process beyond what we had just rolled out in October. We will develop a more comprehensive picture of the islandwide eco-system and connectivity, so that we can better consider how the specific sites connect to our nature cores, buffers and corridors. We will do this in a science-based manner, on an islandwide scale, and we will conduct baseline studies for specific sites to understand their ecological profile and role in ecological connectivity. Members of the nature community will be invited to join us in this upstream work. The findings from these studies will add to the data and connectivity models that NParks has built up over the years, and help guide Government in carrying out longer term planning.",
            "In addition, we have been reviewing whether it would be better to centralise the management of EIA consultants, instead of having individual developers or agencies manage their own. We are still studying this. Separately, we will explore how we can make better use of technology to strengthen project management.",
            "Sir, Members may recall that we had negotiated for the return of the KTM railway line to Singapore in 2011, to meet, among other things, our land use needs. The land that we got back included the 24-km railway line, from North all the way South to Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, as well as adjacent parcels of land at various points along the track. These parcels of land were used by the railway for storage, for housing and for other purposes.",
            "We struck a careful balance between conservation and development in our land use planning for the land that was returned, as follows.",
            "First, by conserving the entire 24-km Rail Corridor from Woodlands all the way down South to Tanjong Pagar for recreation, community activities and for nature.",
            "Second, by conserving the railway station building in Tanjong Pagar and the old Bukit Timah Railway Station, or BTRS, as part of our heritage and history.",
            "And thirdly, by zoning the adjacent land parcels along the railway tracks, including the Kranji site, for development, to meet our people's needs for homes, jobs and amenities and so on.",
            "So, we struck balance in three ways, and if Members may recall in the last Parliamentary Question (PQ) over Ulu Pandan Forest, as I sought to provide the broad outline of how we steward our land to meet various needs, including that for nature, for housing, for jobs and so on and so forth, we include a strategy of big moves – for example, Greater Southern Waterfront, Paya Lebar air base relocation and, of course, this KTM line that we brought back, including the land parcels adjacent, along the way – was one of those moves as well.",
            "For the Kranji site, as Minister Chan Chun Sing had explained earlier, it comprised mostly scrubland scattered with trees when it was returned to Singapore in 2011. Until the detailed plans were finalised and works begun, the site was left vacant, with vegetation and trees allowed to grow to provide green cover until the time of development. Non-native Albizia trees sprouted in recent years – and biologists would know that Albizia trees grow at a very quick rate, they self-sow and they grow as fast as four to five metres a year and can mature in as fast as five years or less – and in Singapore's hot and humid climate, progressively dominated the site within a few years.",
            "So, sites that have been cleared and with intention for some form of development, even as they are left fallow and bare, we allowed vegetation, green cover, so we enjoy that for the few years.",
            "As I have explained in this House recently, we adopt a science-based approach to identify which areas of significant biodiversity to conserve. For instance, the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat, just further north of the Kranji site, was once a fishing village. It had initially been planned for industrial use, for factories. Yet, after careful study through biodiversity surveys and ecological modelling, we decided to keep it as a Nature Park given its high ecological value, both domestically as well as internationally as part of a flyway. Agencies, therefore, had to forego development plans for the area.",
            "For sites to be developed, we seek to preserve and integrate natural elements within the development where possible, to facilitate ecological connectivity. In JTC's masterplan for Sungei Kadut Eco-district, or SKED, 25 hectares out of 500 hectares was set aside for the first phase of the Agri-Food Innovation Park, or AFIP. This is the Kranji site in question.",
            "For the Kranji site, while a portion of the KTM railway line was re-routed along Woodlands Road in 2015 to allow the entire site to be comprehensively developed, JTC worked with NParks to relook these plans. In 2019, they decided to retain the original alignment as a green corridor within the AFIP, even though this meant for JTC that land parcellation for industry would be more challenging.",
            "This effort to retain the original railway line alignment, with additional green buffers on each side amounting to six hectares, along with a linear park along Sungei Pang Sua, is an example of our on-going efforts to balance nature conservation with land planning and development.",
            "We are very encouraged by the growing nature consciousness among Singaporeans. This is part of City in Nature – not just quantitative or qualitative or ecological, but also the DNA mainstreamed in Singaporeans. We will be engaging Singaporeans more deeply on this issue as part of our national conversations on long-term land use planning later this year. We will continue to partner the community as stewards of our City in Nature, and we look forward to working together to achieve this vision."

The penalties for those are laid out in the respective Acts. So, it does not mean that the stern warning is the end of all there is to be."

            "The first is whether we want or need to codify the Environmental Impact Assessment framework into legislation. I think we need to see what the framework is in place, currently, today, as augmented by recent developments, both in June last year and October last year; as well as the plans we have going forward. We look at EIA framework as a whole; and legislation is a tool as are other levers such as guidelines, incentives, processes, standards. They all are different tools with which we use to ensure that the framework is holistic, rigorous and comprehensive.",
            "I said previously, no development, public or private, may take place without planning permission. URA is the gatekeeper with the Planning Act and related planning legislation, as that legislative gateway. As I said earlier, there is not only a masterplanning process in which multiple agencies representing the diversity of needs of Singaporeans, both present and future, but also representing the different constituencies and causes and concerns out there, come together regularly as part of the masterplanning process to look at our land use needs, including sites that we may need for connectivity, for biodiversity, for nature, for recreation. But also, when development plans are surfaced, way in advance of even the first works beginning onsite, there is a screening process.",
            "So, URA acts as a gateway; the Planning Act and related planning legislation are the legislative tools which URA uses to provide that gatekeeping role. And a variety of Technical Agencies will then scrutinise the plans specifically. Each site will have its own variances, its own habitat, its own set of issues. Some of it could be traffic, some of it could be hydrology, some of it could be water quality, some of it could be issues of sedimentation, some about noise, some about biodiversity.",
            "Where nature and biodiversity are concerned, NParks together with the professionals and scientists and arborists and horticulturalists and conservationists, with the support of the nature community whom we consult regularly, we will look at those sites. We will look at those sites for which a development plan is put forward for approval, and then, make an assessment and screen it – notwithstanding the upstream masterplanning phase when plans arrive.",
            "The different agencies, depending on the specific context of the site, impose or require the necessary consultations, studies, which are then pegged onto that planning approval legislative framework.",
            "This kind of approach allows for greater dexterity, greater responsiveness to the site in question. And so, it is a professional assessment, involves specific understanding of the site and the different considerations, both environmental and human.",
            "And then, in June last year, in a Private Member's Motion by Member Louis Ng, together with agencies, the Wildlife Act was brought into force. And if Members may recall, some time back there was some question about whether there is legislative teeth for NParks to enforce in relation to biodiversity environmental management and monitoring. And so, now under section 10 of the Act, there is significant legislative power for the Commissioner to impose the requisite studies, to impose the requisite measures, and penalties are as I have articulated earlier in my speech.",
            "And of course, there are other legislation involving, say, the pollution of waterways, pollution of water bodies, rivers, earth streams, so and so forth. And so, there is a legislative framework and they all come together, not just codified, and frozen in time, but responsive, allowing gatekeeping roles, allowing agencies to come in to making impositions, to impose studies, to then look at those studies and impose the EMMP and other plants.",
            "So, the approach is holistic having said that last October last year, we sought to strengthen the capability of the sector, strengthen the capability that we have locally, strengthen both the understanding of developing agencies as well as EIA consultants. Our nature community tells us that actually what needs to be done is we need to bootstrap, up the standards and ensure consistency in our biodiversity impact assessment capability.",
            "And hence, a very comprehensive approach in our new BIA guidelines which were launched in October last year. I am not quite sure how you can codify something like the BIA guidelines which will be used across different agencies, because it is very comprehensive from a scientific basis, looking at different habitats. So, when there is a mangrove habitat, whether it is intertidal, whether it is whether it is a secondary forest, whether it is scrubland, whether it is a mature forest, whether you look at the benthic habitats. All these are specifically set out in very detailed guidelines, put together by conservationists and in deep consultation with our nature community.",
            "And of course, when development is about to begin and is in progress, there are powers under the Parks and Trees Act, powers to require a tree and flora survey, for which then you can decide whether to grant approval for the clearance of trees or the salvage or the conservation intitule of trees onsite that are of significance. As well as under the Wildlife Act, the imposition of EMMPs, as well as fauna surveys."

Internal investigations commenced immediately within JTC. We made the information public in February, on 16 February as Mr Xie Yao Quan said, because there was public interest in this.",
            "As a general rule as to when we make investigations public, a few considerations will have to be taken into account. First, will it affect the course of the investigations, will it prejudice the course of the investigations? Second, the nature of the incident and which aspect of it will be of public interest.",

            "I have grown up learning that, that may not necessarily be the best solution. Because when more parties get involved, ultimately, who is responsible? If a soldier did not do his job well, we ask whether there were factors that affected his concentration, whether his training was adequate or whether there were other complicating factors. When a supervisor did not do his job well, we ask the same questions and at the end of the day, we want a streamlined process whereby there are clear lines of responsibilities for each of the parties involved in any complex project. And that is what Permanent Secretary Joseph Leong will help us look into.",
            "I thank Mr Yip Hon Weng for the observations.

Agencies come together to look at the different sites, look at the needs that they have for housing, recreation, healthcare, nature, conservation, for heritage, so on and so forth. And then, they work out the masterplan, which is then exhibited and publicly consulted on, including by specific stakeholders and interest groups.",

Because our land use needs, population needs, our natural spaces also evolve and change, and therefore we have to be flexible and nimble and agile, and continuously relook at our masterplan.",
            "Therefore, as I have said in my presentation earlier, there have been sites which have been zoned for other uses, but which, after discussion between agencies, after the use of scientific approaches, have had their plans changed and agencies forgo their initial intentions for that land. For example, where the Kranji site is, it was once railway land. The parcel was made complete by agreed re-routing of the rail corridor, but then, JTC then decided to put it back in again, because they felt that it was important to have that within an Agri-food Innovation Park, in consultation with NParks.",

What was therefore originally planned for industrial purposes has been changed to Nature Park. Likewise, a little further east would be Sungei Khatib Bongsu. Once, it was for prawn farming and fish farming as well as housing, kampong and some human use; subsequently, kept fallow for future development, specifically housing; and those plans were forgone after we evaluated the site and decided to keep it for nature areas."

            "I have two quick supplementary questions – one to the Minister for National Development; it is more factual. It relates to part of my question on how many such unauthorised clearances have occurred in the last 12 months and what were the actions taken to them?",
            "The second is for the Minister-in-charge of the Public Service. As mentioned by a number of Members, many public officers are involved in any large scale and complex project, and often resulting in cross responsibilities. How does the Minister-in-charge of the Public Service plan to look into the processes and into this incident as a learning point, so that such unauthorised actions do not occur again? The Minister shared earlier that Permanent Secretary Joseph Leong will be looking into this. Could the Minister share if there are specific areas that the Permanent Secretary will be directed to look at so that we can improve on processes?"

            "The first, as I have mentioned in my response to Mr Yip Hon Weng's question, indeed, there are many parties involved in a complex project like this, including many parties within the Public Service and of course the private contractors, the consultants and so forth. Indeed, one of the things that I have asked Joseph to look into is how we can streamline the processes with clearer lines of accountability and responsibility, and this does not necessarily mean adding additional layers.",
            "In fact, we should always look for ways to simplify and streamline the processes so that everyone is clear of their respective areas of responsibilities and there can be no doubt. If people are not up to the task, we have to ask ourselves how do we equip them, train them to do their job better. So, that is the first part.",
            "Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may just round up this session. Ultimately, at the end of the day, at the heart of it all, no matter how many rules we have for all the agencies, for all the parties involved, ultimately, at the heart of it, we need people with the right values. I say this particularly for the Public Service – people with the right values who are conscious of their duties, determined to execute it well and constantly find areas to improve when the need arises.",

            ": Mr Speaker, I will focus on two topics in my speech: climate change and COVID-19. One is the most important long-term threat the world faces; and the other, the most immediate threat that is on the minds of world leaders and people around the world. The one thing they have in common is that both address concerns that can only be addressed by concerted effort on the global scale. These problems must be addressed collectively and individual efforts are not going to be enough.",
            "Climate change is getting more and more attention. There is broad consensus that climate change is caused by carbon emissions. As more carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses are emitted, the faster global temperatures rise. The drivers of carbon emission include the industrial development and agriculture, which are in turn driven by consumption. On the other end of the equation, carbon sinks, which are largely forest and plants that absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, are being increasingly destroyed as forests are cleared to make way for development.",
            "The effects of climate change are going to be felt by everyone. As global temperatures rise, the arctic ice caps will start to melt and sea levels will rise. Singapore has already started to make plans for dealing with this in the previous Budgets. At the same time, there will be increased desertification as temperatures rise, and more and more eco-systems and species face the risk of dying out as temperatures rise. There will be extremes of weather, droughts and floods. While people may continue to make adjustments to survive, quality of life will definitely get more harsh and difficult.",
            "Another casualty in this process is the natural world. I was very much moved by Sir David Attenborough’s documentary \"A Life on Our Planet\", which is really a sad reminder of what we have lost in the course of just one lifetime. Some of the frightening figures there include 15 billion trees are being cut down each year and that more than half our rainforests are gone. Coral reefs, which also absorb heat, are dying at an alarming rate because of rising water temperatures and pollution. There are also reports that 60% of invertebrates have been wiped out since 1970. There are large numbers of species going extinct and the current age is being referred to as the Sixth Great Extinction.",
            "Yet, our journey down this path has been paved with good intentions. People want better quality lives and development generally entails clearing land and development. We had a microcosm of this discussion just earlier. This is also why the greatest carbon emitters are the biggest economies, namely the US and China. The greatest carbon sinks are in the developing world. The developing world wants to develop and be more like the developed world, and this entails clearing land.",
            "One area where this is being very publicly debated is the clearing of the Amazon rainforests in Brazil, where land is being cleared at one of its fastest rates. President Jair Bolsanaro has publicly defended his country’s right to clear land for development, while the rest of the world insists it should not.",
            "Brazil's view is understandable. Brazil does not see why it has to forgo its own development for the benefit of the rest of the world. On the flipside, it views the developed world, where countries already benefited from deforestation, are not being fair in telling the developing countries not to develop. Not only that, but the developed world still continues to have a significantly higher carbon footprint than the developing world.",
            "In my view, the only sensible solution to this is that we have to pay countries to conserve their forests. And in order to make this payment, there must be a price on pollution and carbon emissions. These ideas are not new; they have been developed in various international treaties like the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol.",
            "Ideally, if we can have a global carbon trading market, we may be able to have a fair system where countries that create carbon sinks to absorb carbon get payments for doing so, and countries that emit carbon pay for the same. This way, countries will be incentivised to reduce emissions, in which case they pay less. And countries that may be engaged in reforestation and absorb more carbon can get paid more. This will hopefully create a virtual cycle where countries can be incentivised to reduce emissions and, if possible, even to engage in reforestation.",
            "Of course, this is ideal. In order for this to work, the countries emitting carbon have to acknowledge they have a problem.",
            "So, what can Singapore do? Singapore is a small country. We cannot really move the meter very much on the global scale. Our own emissions are probably a drop in the ocean. But I think our Budget measures show a clear commitment to reduce our own carbon footprint and to maintain and manage our own development in a sustainable way.",
            "We had a very long discussion earlier on on the clearing of land in Kranji. The fact that land clearing gets so much attention in this House, to me, is a good sign of how seriously we take this commitment. We recognise the need for development but we also recognise the need to do so sustainably.",
            "I think what we also could do is to lend our voice and continue to do so on the international sphere, and to the extent we can aid in the assistance of working out global solutions.",
            "The two most important players in this space are the US and China. While they are rivals on some fronts, hopefully, on this front, there is an opportunity for them to take the lead in unison. Both President Xi and President Biden have publicly voiced their commitments to reducing emissions, have taken measures, and the next step is to do so in the international scene.",
            "If we reduce emissions and ideally, incentivise and promote reforestation, the effects of climate change may be reversible, but we must work collectively to take effort.",
            "The second topic I will discuss is COVID-19. Just a little over a year ago, in the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 was a little known virus which had been spreading in China in the province of Wuhan, but had little footprint elsewhere. Singapore anticipated the seriousness of this threat and set up its Ministerial taskforce as early as January 2020 with both strategy and tactics coordinated at a high level. We have had our ups and downs in dealing with this virus, the most difficult stretch being the two-month circuit breaker, the period when the virus was spreading rapidly in our foreign worker dormitories.",
            "Notwithstanding the challenges, we have generally managed well and kept our fatality rate amongst the lowest in the world. We have also managed to absorb a large part of the economic impact because of the emergency financial measures we put in place – companies were supported in their payroll, rentals were reduced and managed, and workers who lost jobs or lost income were given compensation.",
            "Many people played a part in this process. Frontline workers kept essential services like hospitals, food supplies and transport running, parents and teachers played their part in helping with home-schooling and later the opening of schools. Today, the situation is under control again, and our journey here was enabled because of collective effort and cooperation. But the situation can change rapidly. All it takes is one or two clusters and it will spread again.",
            "The most important next step in this battle is the vaccination. Happily, Singapore is in a position where we have adequate supply of the vaccines coming in the course of the year.",
            "According to the BBC, vaccine efficacy based on data coming in is actually quite strong, with Pfizer, Modena, even Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine all having efficacy levels of above 90%, which is a measure of how much they reduce the risk of coming down with symptoms of COVID-19. Although no vaccine has 100% efficacy, even for those people who do come down with COVID-19 symptoms after taking the vaccine, it had generally not been fatal. So, the symptoms are usually more mild. So, what this means is there is close to 100% protection against serious effects of COVID-19.",
            "The benefits are definitely there to the individual for taking the vaccine. But we have a slight problem in Singapore. The slight problem we have is that our community spread rates are low and most people are less afraid of getting the virus. So, a number of the people I have spoken to have suggested they would prefer to take a wait-and-see approach; there is no urgency to take it, so let other people take it first. Of course, if everyone does this, there will be a risk that our vaccination rates do not go up as quickly as we would like them to.",
            "Other Members in this House have spoken on how we should incentivise people to take vaccines, with Dr Lim Wee Kiak suggesting that vouchers be given out, and Mr Alex Yam suggesting it be made mandatory.",
            "My suggestion is a variation on the scheme but I would suggest that what we should do is give incentives to people who take the vaccine but not monetary incentives. We should give them more liberties. So, for example, if you have a group of people who are all vaccinated, they may be allowed to meet in groups of larger than eight. Workplaces may be allowed to operate at higher than 50% occupancy if everyone who is attending in the office has taken the vaccination. So, these are sort of gentle ways to, I think, nudge people into taking the vaccine, to give them very tangible, immediate benefits.",
            "Ultimately, it is my hope that we will be able to get all people vaccinated as soon as possible. Vaccines can remain optional but I think if benefits are linked to it, liberties are linked to it, people will take it up more.",
            "It is my hope that all eligible people will take the vaccine soonest, as this will probably have the greatest impact in getting back to as close to normal as possible. Mr Speaker, in Tamil.",
            "(In Tamil):",
            "Mr Speaker, the past year has been a difficult one for all of us because of COVID-19. Some of you or your loved ones may have been infected by the virus. Many more would have experienced loss of income, loss of jobs and big changes in lifestyle.",
            "The Government provided significant support last year, providing companies with help like JSS, which provided support for up to 75% of Singaporean’s salaries which helped keep many people in jobs. Those who lost jobs or had significant loss of income were given financial support. The self-employed were also supported, in particular, those in the affected transport sector like taxi drivers.",
            "During the lockdown period, many of us were wishing for a vaccine. This vaccine is now here and being rolled out. I would thus strongly encourage everyone to take it. These vaccines have gone through extensive clinical testing and are generally safe to be taken.",
            "For those with serious medical conditions or concerns, you may check with your doctors to be sure. If we are able to get a large part of our population vaccinated, then it will be harder for the virus to spread, protecting even those amongst us who are unable to take it.",
            "We have put up with a lot of challenges in the last year – the next step, to take the vaccine, should be a lot easier and it is my hope that everyone who is able to will take it as soon as they can."

            ": Mr Speaker, last year has been a difficult year for many Singaporeans due to COVID-19. Fortunately, due to Singapore’s strong fiscal position and our reserves, we were able to turn the situation around. The five Budgets announced by Finance Minister last year has helped many of our workers stay employed and helped many businesses stave off insolvency.",
            "Many of my friends who are employers expressed their appreciation for the Jobs Support Scheme which has helped them to keep paying their staff. I also met many residents who were able to receive the Self-employed Income Relief Scheme or SIRS because this gave them much support for the leaner months due to the circuit breaker. There was also substantial support given by the Government for families to help build a caring and inclusive home and plans to transform and grow the economy. Compared with many other countries, Singapore has done relatively well in managing the negative impact on the economy.",
            "For that, I think it is appropriate to give credit to Deputy Prime Minister and his colleagues from the Finance Ministry as well as to thank the Multi-Ministry Task Force and the many frontline workers for their efforts in keeping Singapore strong economically and for keeping Singapore safe.",
            "The Deputy Prime Minister has said that the Government will enhance the salaries of nurses and other healthcare workers. I fully agree. Like several other Members of Parliament before me, I also urge the Government to consider enhancing the salaries of our other essential workers as well. The COVID-19 crisis has shown us that during a health crisis of this nature, our essential workers, like our cleaners and those who clear our rubbish on a regular basis, they play an important role in our daily lives.",
            "I submit that we must also give credit to Singaporeans who gave their full-hearted support for the efforts of the Government. Singaporeans wore face masks when it was mandated, they used sanitisers regularly, stayed at home where necessary during the circuit breaker and coped with safe distancing measures. Our citizens did their part to help manage this pandemic.",
            "Although the impact of the past five Budgets have made a great difference to many workers and businesses, the question is what next.",
            "As a country with no natural resources, we must always be mindful of digging into our reserves which is finite. The last five Budgets with all the additional COVID-19 support measures have cost Singapore almost $100 billion. This year, our expenditure for Health has shot up to $18.8 billion. Defence will cost $15.4 billion and Education will cost $13.6 billion. Our deficit for this year is projected at $11 billion.",
            "Members may also recall that during the National Day Rally in 2019, the Prime Minister said that it will cost $100 billion or more to protect Singapore against rising sea levels. Will we ever be able to put back the $100 billion withdrawn from our reserves for this COVID-19 support measures?",
            "I recall in 2011 that the Government returned the $4 billion which was withdrawn from the reserves for Jobs Credit Scheme. How will we be able to pay for the huge expenditure required for future development projects?",
            "Over the next week, during the Committee of Supply debate, we will hear many Members of Parliament asking the Government to do more and more for our citizens. And I hope that we will all exercise prudence and remember that the Government is but the trustee of all the taxes paid by all tax payers. Every additional tax relief or subsidy that Members ask for would mean that taxpayers would have to pay for those measures. No one likes to pay more taxes but yet, if we do not project for more tax revenue, we will not be able to fund those expenses which are necessary. We may not be able to help those who truly need additional help from the Government's measures.",
            "Sir, Budget 2021 contains various measures to help Singapore to emerge stronger as a nation. I agree with the general direction set by this Government to emerge stronger together. I think it is important for the Government to help our businesses transform so that they can create good jobs for our citizens and opportunities for all the businesses. We must be ready for a post-COVID future and build a stronger Singapore.",
            "Our citizens must also be equipped and upskilled to take up jobs which may be different from the current jobs that they are used to. We must never be complacent and think that our place in this world is guaranteed because Singapore had been successful in our earlier years. If our Singapore workers lose their desire to work hard, lose their hunger to be successful, other countries whose citizens are more hungry will step up to meet the challenge.",
            "Sir, I wish to sound a word of caution to my fellow Singaporeans. Last year was described to be an unprecedented year in which Singapore suffered one of the worst recessions in our nation’s history. However, when I read the real estate statistics shared by URA in January this year, I was surprised to find that prices of private properties still managed to increase by 2.2% last year. Sale of private properties by developers and in the resale market did not slow down at all despite this recession. And despite the fact that there are many unsold properties in the market, URA tells me that there are 52,783 unsold units in the market which have already obtained planning approval. Despite so many unsold units, residential property prices remain high as developers did not reduce their prices. In fact, agents tell me that some new developments which were launched recently in my constituency are priced at between $2,100 and $2,800 per square foot.",
            "Friends in the car industry also told me that there were visibly more people in the car showrooms looking to buy cars. It was as if there was no recession at all, much less the worst recession in Singapore’s history.",
            "So, I urge the Government to continue to be fiscally prudent in its Budget. We need to save for another rainy day because we really have no other natural resources except our reserves. I also urge Singaporeans to be mindful that we must all exercise financial prudence to prepare for uncertain times ahead of us.",
            "COVID-19 has changed the way many businesses operate and many businesses have realised that they can operate their business from anywhere in the world without having to come to Singapore. Thus, we must never take Singapore’s continued success for granted. Sir, I support the Budget Statement by the Finance Minister."

            "As we moved into our second year of the COVID-19, many of us learned to live in the new normal. It is no longer just an emergency. Instead of only viewing COVID as a crisis, we are now better able to re-orientate ourselves to seek out the opportunities, to boost Singapore’s future health status.",
            "As someone who is involved in the transport sector, I feel that COVID-19 gives us the chance to put in a place a more environmentally friendly and sustainable model of public transport which is also a better use of public resources.",
            "The key reason for this is how working from home has taken hold around the world, and in Singapore.",
            "I must confess I was not a fan of working from home. I did not believe that people could be as productive when they are in the comfort of their home, and surrounded by distractions. But what I saw during the circuit breaker period made me a convert. More importantly, I observed that for the first time in my life, the roads were empty and public transport was not crowded during the usual morning and evening peak hours, which is what we call the devil horns of public transport. The morning/evening peaks are the devil horns of public transport.",
            "Will working from home be a permanent feature of our working life?",
            "Even though cases in the community are low and we have started our mass vaccination exercise, MOM still advises companies to adopt working from home policies as a default option. Meanwhile, Chinese newspaper Lianhe Zaobao reported that more than 40% of Singaporeans would like to continue working from home after the pandemic.",
            "To get a sense from actual businesses on the ground whether working from home is here to stay, I conducted a survey of over 30 of my fellow CEOs in the private sector, ranging from large companies to SMEs. They include MNCs, law firms, architectural firms, financial institutions and manufacturing companies and so on. I asked them if working from home would be a permanent feature at their companies after the pandemic. About 58% said it would not and citing reasons such as lower productivity, majority of the staff are operational staff, lack of opportunities for building camaraderie, for not endorsing working from home. The bright spot is that the remaining 42% said they would embrace working from home in the long run and they said about 20% of their staff would likely be working from home at any one time.",
            "If this is representative of the majority of companies in Singapore, we could take the opportunity to re-shape our public transport system.",
            "I would go further and suggest that we actively work toward having about 40% of organisations in Singapore commit to having about 20% of their staff to work from home at any one time. One way we could go about this is for the Civil Service, which is the largest employer in Singapore, to weigh in and implement longer term working from home policies especially for the back-end and support staff.",
            "I remember when all sorts of incentives, like free travel on certain peak hour periods, were introduced to try to change commuter travel patterns, it took months, if not years, to take effect. COVID-19 achieved that in a matter of days. Without the devil horns, everybody has a more comfortable ride and it also benefits the environment. We should work to stop the horns from growing back.",
            "Indeed a report from the International Energy Agency states: “Research has shown that disruptions can be a catalyst for shifts towards more sustainable transport behaviours but avoiding a return to pre-crisis behaviours requires governments to take decisive action.”",
            "In the same report, it notes that most people are shifting to cycling, in order to avoid potentially crowded buses and trains. The same is happening in Singapore, though to a lesser extent, as sales of personal bicycles go up and bike-sharing companies report an increase in ridership. An example of the Government taking decisive action would be to invest in new and improved cycling networks to make sustainable transport more attractive and safer.",
            "On sustainability, I would like to move on to the topic of whether our bus services are sustainable. Currently, there are many bus services running alongside and duplicating MRT routes, which are costing too much money, according to Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat.",
            "Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat also informed us that out of the 356 bus services in Singapore, only 11 services were profitable in 2019. The Government had to subsidise $1 billion to operate the remaining 345 services. In 2020, only two bus services were profitable as bus ridership plunged during the pandemic. I could not be sure how much subsidy was given out in 2020, but logically, it would be over $1 billion.",
            "At the same time, we have made a huge investment into the MRT network. Our current MRT network is about 230 km and MOT plans to increase the network to 360 km by 2030. In the last Budget, it was already announced that the Government would be spending more than $60 billion this decade to expand and renew the rail network. After spending so much money, it is natural to encourage more people to use the MRT for longer distance travel, which are more comfortable and efficient, instead of taking buses running parallel to the MRT lines. What do I mean?",
            "The three longest bus routes in Singapore are service numbers 30, 51 and 61. Let me us service number 61 to illustrate. For service 61, the bus ride from Bukit Batok takes more than two hours, calling on 19 MRT stations in between. If you take a train from Bukit Batok to Eunos, the travelling time is only 46 minutes – 120 minutes bus ride as compared to 46 minutes train ride.",
            "The above example shows that it is better for bus services to connect people to the train stations within a town, and that is for the first and last mile connection. It is more efficient to travel between towns using MRT. Thus, I would like to propose a radical idea.",
            "Currently, many duplicate bus services ply through the Central Business District or CBD. And yet, the CBD is well-served by the MRT. Most buildings in the CBD are within 400 metres of an MRT station. Hence, I propose that LTA consider having bus services terminate at MRT station bus stops just outside the CBD and have dedicated feeder bus services to ply within CBD, connecting all the interchange MRT stations. There are many benefits associated with this proposal.",
            "Firstly, we can drastically cut the number of duplicate bus services and number of buses plying within the CBD, without compromising the service level. We can even allow only electric buses to ply within CBD. This will help to reduce air pollution within the CBD and contribute to the Green Plan 2030.",
            "Secondly, having all existing cross-town trunk services to terminate just outside the CBD will naturally cut short the trunk services, making bus services more reliable and cheaper to run. The resources saved can be used to improve bus connectivity within each HDB town.",
            "I am sure many Members in this House have received feedback from their residents on the need to enhance bus connectivity within their respective divisions. The most common grouses among my Nanyang residents is the inconvenience of getting to the polyclinic and back home. It is not uncommon that residents have to walk a total of 700 metres plus a bus ride or change bus services to reach the polyclinic. When one is unwell, a 700-metre walk is not pleasant.",
            "Reforming bus routes is not new. Seoul has done it successfully, by re-organising its bus system to create safer, more comfortable and efficient rides. I am not advocating we reduce the $1 billion subsidies for the bus services. I think it is necessary to subsidise public transport just like we subsidise healthcare. I am advocating making bus services more efficient, complementing the train network and adjust to changes in transport behaviour, including the trend of working from home. The worst option is to raise public transport fares significantly to cover costs if ridership remains low.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has its perils but it has also provided us the golden opportunity to keep the devil horns away and create a more environmentally friendly and sustainable bus system that does not compete with the MRT, but is in synergy.",
            "Mr Speaker, Sir, my last topic is pertaining to the Budget measures in relation to the incentives to promote electric cars. When similar measures were announced last year, it electrified the debate. This year, it has done the same trick again. Let me elaborate in Mandarin.",
            "Many car owners are wondering, why is the Government so eager to raise the petrol tax this year while the new incentive measures for electric vehicles will only be implemented next year?",
            "Moreover, there are few charging points for electric vehicles today and they can barely satisfy the existing 1,000 or so electric vehicles. This is not enough to encourage Singaporeans to buy electric vehicles. URA and LTA have already put up tenders to invite operators to install charging points to cater for 600-odd electric vehicles at more than 200 public carparks island wide. Most of the charging points will only be installed next year, in other words, water from afar cannot put out fires nearby.",
            "For taxi drivers and private hire drivers, the pandemic has significantly reduced their income. The increase in petrol tax at this time is like adding frost to snow. As the Government has said, taxi and private car hire car owners will enjoy a 15% road tax rebate of up to one year and an additional $360 in a four-month period. The total rebate for these two types of rebates is about $513. For taxis that travel 400 km a day, the additional $1 per litre of petrol tax amounts to $663 additional cost a year. The rebate of $513 is not enough. Fortunately, the Government has heard the taxi drivers' appeal and announced yesterday that full-time relief taxi drivers will also enjoy the additional $360 petrol tax rebate to further reduce the impact of the petrol tax hike.",
            "As far as taxi drivers and private hire drivers are concerned, I would also like to mention that it is unlikely that their income will improve before the end of this year. It is because it is unlikely that tourism will recover and nightclubs will reopen within this year. The trend of working from home will continue. Hence, I urge LTA to consider extending the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund to the end of the year.",
            "Mr Speaker, notwithstanding the issues raised above, I support the Budget."

In a flash, an entire generation started to grasp digital tools in order to adjust to the new norm. Despite social distancing and self-isolation, we are all finding ways to connect with one another. Twenty-twenty was a year of disruptions and we had to disconnect to reconnect.",

            "To help the new rising companies and try to avoid the downfall of some big wigs, the Government has announced four additional Budgets with a supplement of nearly $100 billion.",
            "This Budget will: one, help certain sectors to retain, retrain and prepare workers to be ready to spring back right away after recovery; two, help companies transform themselves for the future digital economy; three, support the core and the worst hit sectors, such as aviation, land transport, arts and sports; four, co-fund new ventures in the areas of creative ideas; and five, help the high-growth enterprises and the startups to have continued access into financial capital.",
            "The Government stands in solidarity with Singaporeans and will try to assist companies to adapt to the economic debacle that we are facing and there will be various assistance and grants. However, our workers and businesses must have the resilience to build their own muscles to innovate, have a creative mindset to reinvent themselves, be adaptable and be forward-thinking to compete against the best on the global stage. And we need to have the gumption and fortitude to succeed in spite of the risk of failure. In unity, we can emerge stronger.",
            "Last month, together with several fellow members of the GPC for MSE, we filed a Motion to accelerate and deepen efforts to combat climate change. And I am heartened to read about the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the goals outlined by the five Ministries.",

            "The crisis also presents opportunities in certain sectors and provides the impetus for new approaches.",
            "This Budget has some bold initiatives, particularly green ones, which I am delighted will be implemented.",
            "Like water, food security is a critical national issue. I have always felt strongly about ensuring food security for Singapore, so much so that I had urged the Government for more sector support in this House a few times in the past.",
            "Hence, I welcome the decision to commit $60 million to a new Agri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund. The Fund will help us move towards the 30-by-30 goal of producing 30% of our food through local farms by 2030. This will be no mean feat, considering that we are at less than 10% today.",
            "I understand the COVID-19 crisis has placed an enormous strain on our financial resources. Nonetheless, I seek the Minister's assurance that funding will be increased when our economy recovers.",
            "I would also like to ask the Minister if the Agri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund is in addition to the $63 million Agriculture Productivity Fund (APF) launched in 2014. Would the Minister share with us how much of the APF has been utilised to-date and provide a summary of the projects it supported, such as the type of farming projects and food production?",
            "It is important that we continue to develop this sector and ensure its viability, as this industry is perceived to be less profitable than other industries, such as manufacturing and financial services.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of locally produced food. We are fortunate to have adequate national food reserves and have been able to work well with our regional and global partners to keep borders open for goods to flow between countries so far. However, we should not take these arrangements for granted.",
            "We must be prepared for other crises in the future and the more local food production sources we have, the less vulnerable we are to supply disruptions.",
            "I am heartened to note that we are exploring and tapping upon available technologies to overcome our land constraints for food production, whether these are for fruits, plants, livestock, or new types of production, such as lab-grown meat. These are capital intensive but necessary for food security.",
            "To strengthen food security, besides sector-friendly Government policies and financial support, we need to develop a whole eco-system to make the agri-food sector a significant economic sector. We need to nurture a new generation of local expertise, while consulting with leading agri-food practitioners and researchers locally and internationally. We need new faculties in our ITEs, Polytechnics and Universities to prepare our people for jobs and careers in this sector.",
            "We should continue to support small local household and community farming endeavors too. The output from household and community farms may be small but every effort to contribute to our food security and resilience is important. As the saying goes, many little drops make an ocean.",
            "In his Budget speech,",
            "Deputy Prime Minister Heng mentioned, we need a whole-of-society approach to succeed in realising our sustainability goals.",
            "As the efforts to support supply side factors continue to strengthen, it is also important to increase consumer awareness and confidence in local produce to build up demand from our local population.",
            "As I have raised in one of my previous speeches, we should encourage a \"Buy Singapore\" mentality where Singaporeans choose local brands and products in an informed manner. \"Buy Singapore\" will not only help ensure the sustainability of producing local food but also reduce our carbon footprint, as transportation and refrigeration required to move and store food over long distances are reduced.",
            "In fact, \"Buy Singapore\" can also be expanded to include goods and services beyond the agri-food sector. There are other local industries that may potentially have an advantage in serving our domestic market. These should be supported and better funded to help them grow. Buying products using materials that are preferably locally sourced and made here is another way of reducing one's carbon footprint.",
            "I full-heartedly support the Ministry's decision to issue green bonds to fund select public infrastructure projects.",
            "Three years ago, I had suggested that we",
            "designate a proportion of our borrowings for green projects to be in green bonds issuance. Not only will this support the Monetary Authority of Singapore's aim of growing the green bond market in Singapore, Government issues will help develop a green bond market of a significant size.",
            "As ASEAN's largest green finance market, we account for about half of the cumulative ASEAN green bond and loan issuances.",
            "We can look forward to a more dynamic bond market with a greater variety of products to offer different investors.",
            "The bonds are expected to finance a wide range of green projects and I hope that the Government will include agri-food developments in these issues and its distribution can be sized such that even small investors can participate and do their part to support the growth of Singapore's agri-food sector.",
            "Many green and sustainability-linked projects will be pioneering initiatives and do not have track records. To enable current and new enterprises in these endeavours, I hope the Government will consider more risk co-sharing with investors and banks so that green start-ups will have higher chances of bringing their visions to fruition.",
            "Lastly, I would like to appeal on behalf of motorcyclists, taxi and private-hire-car drivers for more support to defray their increased cost of operations due to the increase in petrol duty rates.",
            "While there are various measures to ease the transition, such as road tax rebates, cash handouts and petrol duty rebates, many of the users who depend on their vehicles for their livelihoods have shared with me their hardships and made their calculations. The rebates will not be enough to offset the higher duty rates.",
            "The intention of the rate hikes is to encourage more green behaviour and reduce the purchase and use of vehicles using internal combustion engines.",
            "However, at this point in time, these users have no other alternatives but to use their current vehicles to earn a living. Many of them deliver goods with the proliferation of online orders. They are not able yet to switch to electric vehicles due to sunk costs or infrastructural constraints. They, however, are faced with the immediate reality that the hike will increase their costs and cut their take-home pay.",
            "I appeal to the Minister to consider providing more financial subsidies or rebates to help them tide over this difficult period or until they have time to switch over to electric vehicles.",

            "COVID-19 has given us a unique opportunity – to \"build back better\".",
            "Mr Speaker, I am proud of the public commitments in the Green Plan, from planting one million trees to phasing out internal combustion engines by 2030. Climate change is absolutely the biggest existential problem of the 21st century, for the world, for Singapore.",
            "I am particularly proud that we are forging a brave new green economy, with new green jobs in green technology, including agri-tech, alternative fuels, the circular economy and also green financing and carbon markets and services. This is the big unlock. The idea that we can grow our environmental sustainability and our economy, both together.",
            "So, I was perturbed when a young resident, Brian, said to me that he was ashamed to be Singaporean, because we are not doing enough; that Singapore's emissions are still rising at 2% to 3%; that we are among the worst in the world in terms of emissions per capita; that on the Climate Action Tracker website, we are squarely in the Red zone, indicating that our policies and commitments are, I quote, \"outside of (a country's) fair-share range and are not at all consistent with holding warming to below two degrees Celsius, let alone with the Paris Agreement's stronger 1.5 degree Celsius\".",
            "Mr Speaker, I am not an activist. I am a consultant who works with businesses and Government. But I am also a lover of Nature and a global citizen who is deeply concerned about the world we leave behind for our future generations. And I think, it is important to look at things from all sides so that we can carve the best pathway to fit our needs and our aspirations and bring everyone along.",
            "Where do we stand today? Singapore accounts for only 0.1% of global emissions. In reducing emissions, we face constraints in our size and our geography. A complete shift to renewables is probably not on the cards. While in our CBD, the \"urban canyon\" effect affects temperatures at the micro level.",
            "It is true Singapore ranks 27th highest out of 142 countries in emissions per capita. But it is not surprising; we are a hub economy. Our status as a manufacturing hub, a trade hub, is the envy of the world. Take Jurong Island – home to more than 100 oil and gas companies, and petrochemical companies, and investments of more than $50 billion.",
            "Mr Speaker, you and I, and I am sure every one of our colleagues in this House, have residents who work on Jurong Island, or Changi Airport, or the Port of Singapore. Oil and gas, petrochemicals, aviation and shipping – these are all hard-to-abate sectors where direct electrification or shift to renewables is technically not yet viable or too expensive, but they are also a significant share of our GDP.",
            "For a hub like us, a better metric is emissions per GDP dollar, or emissions intensity, where we are in the best 20. As a hub, we provide goods and services to the world, and as a hub, we are already doing this more cleanly than most.",
            "Mr Speaker, the climate change space is fast developing. According to the International Energy Agency, 50% of global emissions reduction to reach net zero needs to come from technology that is still in the demo stage. Yet, we cannot underestimate the progress of technology, nor the power of the people, especially young people. There is a gathering momentum on carbon reductions from the demand side, from businesses, investors and government. I know because my clients are asking for advice.",
            "What if our trading partners introduce carbon border taxes – which Europe is already planning? What if pressure on net zero shipping cripples long distance shipping? Now, if that is not an existential crisis of epic proportions for Singapore, I do not know what is! In some sectors, a wait-and-see approach could be more risky than getting ahead of the curve.",
            "Mr Speaker, it does not look likely that we will meet the two-degree goal. We are unlikely to get to carbon negative by 2030 which is what it would take.",
            "But let us not be discouraged. Singapore has the potential to lead the technological innovations, the business model innovation, the necessary eco-system collaborations in order to push the techno-commercial limits around decarbonisation, and then turn all of it into our new exports. We did it before with water. We can do it again.",
            "Our economy will be more competitive, more resilient and we will be enabling, empowering the rest of the world to reach the two-degree goal. In short, we can lead the world. Surely, that is something to be proud of.",
            "Pragmatic problem-solving, innovation, execution – that has always been the Singapore way. We aim for best in class, but we know that this will evolve over time, so our approach must be a humble, learning approach – learning from the past, learning from others – as we position ourselves to lead in policy, technology, collaboration and advocacy.",
            "As we build and learn, I call for the Government to stay open to revisit our commitments and put in more aggressive targets over time because a bigger ambition drives the pace of innovation, gives businesses and investors the confidence to invest, and gives us the licence to engage more broadly – to lead the world.",
            "Mr Speaker, I would like to propose three ideas where I think there is scope for us to invest more so that we might lead the world. I will focus on decarbonisation, leaving the also important restoration of our natural habitats and nature-based solutions to others.",
            "First, double down on the sectors for which Singapore can be the world's most sustainable hub; in doing so, increase our value-add and our competitiveness. There are sectors where because we are a hub, Singapore has an opportunity, and indeed, some might say, an obligation to define the 21st century vision for the sector. I highlight two today: petrochemicals and shipping.",
            "There are more than 100 petrochemical companies with major operations in Singapore, mostly on Jurong Island. This manufacturing base and our position as a trade and logistics hub for petrochemicals make us uniquely positioned to incubate and scale technology, solutions and services to enable a green petrochemical supply chain. With best-in-class sustainable assets, and symbiotic relationships across the eco-system to unlock collective benefits and drive resilience in the face of externality pricing.",
            "Now shipping. Normally shipping generates 2% of global greenhouse emissions. As a country it will be the sixth largest. There is growing policy and social pressure to decarbonise shipping. The Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping is a coalition that has been established to drive the maturity of decarbonisation technologies in shipping, with seven founding partners. But it is European-centric. An Asian platform is lacking. Singapore can set up or enable a similar coalition in Asia.",
            "Mr Speaker, many green economy jobs will be technical and engineering work. Thanks to our development history, we have a strong local core in areas like process engineering, energy management, control systems, from the vocational level to advanced engineering. We can be optimistic that this time, with some training, it is our Singaporean workforce who will benefit most from the transition.",
            "My second proposal is to push forward on international and regional engagement, coordination and leadership, starting with ASEAN. The 10 ASEAN economies contribute 7.5% of global emissions. Four of them are in the top 10 countries in the world most at risk from climate change. Singapore is not one of the four. The countries have very different carbon intensities, with Indonesia accounting for more than 60%. Indonesia emissions from land use, land use change and forestry – or what we call LULUCF in the industry – are higher than their forest carbon sinks while Malaysia and the Philippines have net negative emissions from their carbon sinks. There is scope for collaboration – things that can be done at scale.",
            "Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), expensive in Singapore, but, with cross-border carbon sinks, we may be able to get the economics to work. Singapore could tap on regional renewable energy grids while providing carbon offset markets and green financing to complement our neigbours’ green efforts. We can lead the region down a collective 2-degree path; an ASEAN 2-degree path that plays to our individual strengths.",
            "My third proposal is to be innovative in encouraging individual actions. Many of us in this House have made our green resolutions – from metal straws to collecting rainwater to planting trees. In the Budget, the Government will partner Singaporeans and support ground-up projects. I hope, I know, our wonderful youths will pick up the baton and push the boundaries. But we cannot just preach to the converted. For the ambivalent or the sceptical, it can be hard to make climate change relevant. It can be harder still to get Singaporeans and Singapore companies to pay more to go green. We cannot simply tout statistics. We cannot simply tell people they must pay more, we cannot simply tell them to stop doing something. But we can provide a vision of a sustainable Singapore in a way that appeals to both reason and emotion. I believe that one way is through stories, poetry and literature. So, let us bring our creative arts community into this campaign. Then let us encourage all who have a stake in Singapore – individuals, families, communities, SMEs, corporates, to commit to climate change action.",
            "An inclusive transition. We all hope for an inclusive transition, one where the disadvantaged are not further left behind. One that is free from the hypocrisy and power plays that, I hate to say, are often thinly veiled in their space.",
            "An inclusive transition means advocating to support developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Developing countries suffer the brunt of the impact of climate change, physically through flash floods, the destruction of flora and fauna, disease outbreaks and whole islands sinking, as well as economically through lower crop yields, for example. At the same time, many emerging countries exhibit high emissions intensities.",
            "The developed nations are reducing their emissions, but it is a case of been there, done that. Many developing countries, especially in Asia, are still industrialising – iron, steel, cement will be needed for years to come. Developed countries have been able to mitigate their emissions partly because global manufacturing has migrated to emerging markets that have invested heavily in energy, in particular, coal. The average age of coal plants in Asia is only 12 years versus a useful life of 50 years. The cost to transition is, therefore, huge. China, perhaps, can do it. But many emerging markets will need help – aid, debt assistance, technical assistance. Singapore can advocate for their voices to be heard, not to give them excuses, but to get them help from the advanced economies. We ourselves must be happy to help, happy to share our expertise and platforms in technical and financing aspects because that is leadership.",
            "An inclusive transition also means considering and mitigating the impact on the most vulnerable people, including lower income groups whose livelihoods depend on the carbon economy, for example, taxi and private car drivers and delivery riders. Many of my colleagues have talked about them today. The petrol duty hike is an immediate hit to their pockets when many are already struggling. One resident told me that he needed to drive the equivalent of an extra day to make up for it. The rebates help but, may I ask, for how long will this be extended for this particular segment? The duty hike comes when alternatives do not yet really exist, certainly not for this segment. Actually, I take that back. There is one alternative – e-bikes that many switched to after the PMD ban. But Mr Speaker, it was with despair that I learnt that e-bikes are being financed in the market at exorbitant interest rates. We have got to stop these predatory behaviours. It is just not fair. Further, as technology continues to accelerate, driverless cars will become a reality. An inclusive transition must, therefore, create new green jobs, with training and reskilling, so that the most vulnerable will directly benefit.",

            "Climate change is going to affect all us, and more importantly, our children and our children’s children. It is a matter of life and death. Technology will play a big role, but we also need to change how we produce, consume and dispose.",
            "The government’s Green Plan articulates a compelling vision where taking care of the environment is no longer seen as at odds with economic growth. New jobs will be created in the new Green Economy, in fields like engineering, carbon services and green financing. Many of these jobs will require a good foundation in Science, Technology and Engineering (STEM).",
            "Although our Malay community has made progress overall in tertiary education, we remain underrepresented in STEM fields. It is already hurting us in the digital economy. Let us not miss the boat in the green economy. Instead, let us identify the root causes, the key steps where Malays fall out – be it when they choose what to study in school, or when they choose their first job, and address those.",
            "The Government, schools and M3 must help Malay youths and Malays in the workforce to get an equal chance at developing interest, knowledge and skills in STEM, including green technologies. This exposure must come early. It means creating an environment that is attractive and conducive for Malay students to choose STEM courses and careers, for example, by ensuring that Malays are part of the faculty, providing better support systems and building confidence.",
            "I have spoken to a Malay youth in Woodlands. Despite qualifying for Junior College, he decided to take the Polytechnic route. I found out that he had shown promise in Science and Math, but ultimately chose to go into another field. The reason was, the youth was uncomfortable, felt that he did not belong, there were few Malays. He also believed that the STEM fields will be harder and yet the returns he might get or the levels he might get to will be commensurate. Mentorship and role models are key.",
            "Malays in the workforce should have access to and take advantage of the training and reskilling required to support the transition to the new green economy and further their careers there, as part of a broad-based workforce transition or as part of a commitment to diversity and inclusion among our companies.",
            "At the same time our young Malays and their parents must be proactive to position themselves in the new green economy. They must hone their skills and learn, from Malays and non Malays, in the STEM fields. M3 must provide the platforms and the outreach.",
            "Mr Speaker, as a community, we Malays love nature, which is an important element of sustainable development. We must ensure that all in our community join in this climate change discussion – not just the fortunate few.",
            "We are all in this together. The Green Plan outlines a whole-of-nation approach to climate change. And that is what it takes, the whole nation and our partners, to unite in this fight. We are all in this together.",
            "Mr Speaker, the world lauds our Government’s exceptional handling of the COVID-19 crisis. But good governance is only part of it. Our success has been because our people trusted that we are doing our best to keep us safe during this crisis.",
            "Devastating as the COVID-19 crisis has been, climate change is an even bigger crisis, with even higher stakes. I hope that, again, our people, our businesses, our partners will trust that we are doing our best, not only to keep us safe, but to keep the world safe; not only today but for future generations. And that they will push together with us to lead the world.",
            "If we do this, Mr Speaker, I am sure Brian will feel proud that we are, indeed, doing our best. I am sure he will feel proud to be Singaporean.",

            ": Mr Speaker, we are at an important part of our nation’s recovery from one of the deepest economic downturns ever experienced, due to COVID-19.",
            "While we have steadied the ship, this storm is far from over. Although the wind is still not behind our sails, we are making headway. However, we face significant headwinds when, all around us, the pandemic is still raging. Turbulent times still lay ahead on the horizon.",
            "In my maiden speech last year, I spoke about strengthening connections and the building blocks of our society in these uncertain times. Hence, I welcome this Budget which focuses on strengthening our people, our businesses and our reserves for the future as we emerge stronger together.",
            "I will be elaborating in the Committee of Supply debates but, for now, I will broadly outline three areas that we should strengthen: first, our relations with neighbouring countries; second, our social fabric as one united Singapore; and third, sustainability for our future generations.",
            "The first part. The Council of Foreign Relations stated in April 2020: “Singapore, one of the world’s wealthiest and most trade-dependent countries, punches above its weight in regional and global affairs”. This does not happen overnight or by chance, but by deliberate design, decisive actions and purposeful policies over the years.",
            "Singapore’s economy depends heavily on trade. In times of crisis, however, some nations tend to look inwards, preferring protectionism over partnerships, sheer competition over collaborations. We cannot afford to do that. COVID-19 has reinforced how important it is for Singapore to continue to play an active role internationally and deepen our interactions with key stakeholders and other countries.",
            "I think that maintaining and strengthening relations with our immediate neighbours will be more critical than ever to overcome the socio-economic impact of COVID-19, particularly in ASEAN. I have two proposals here.",
            "First, we should look and work towards having more travel bubbles with strategic countries as the situation improves. This promotes not only more business travels and encourage more Singaporeans to take advantage of overseas opportunities, but it would also allow the flow of people and reconnection of families who have been kept apart in this pandemic.",
            "Second, we have to invest in Singapore’s long-term infrastructure to prepare ourselves against future pandemics even after we see the end of this one, which may be another four to five years away. For instance, with Connect@Changi, quarantine-free business travel is made possible. It is hoped that aviation, tourism and retail businesses can benefit from it, thereby enabling gradual economic recovery.",
            "The second part – strengthening our social fabric. We have started living life more normally with less restrictions, at an earlier time compared to other countries. And as we recover and adapt ourselves to a post-COVID-19 world, we have to engage and empower Singaporeans to play an even greater role in our Total Defence.",
            "We should tap on our strengths as a multi-racial society. An SMU study had found that people living in more racially diverse neighbourhoods are more likely to lend a helping hand to others in need. Their surroundings made them appreciate that they are all members of a collective and broadened their sense of identity, enabling them to see others as their own.",
            "I am thus happy that Budget 2021 focuses on strengthening our social compact, with the expansion of ComLink, greater support for children with special needs and assistance to lower income households through various schemes.",
            "There are some groups, however, that still require more targeted assistance than others.",
            "First, ex-offenders, upon prison release, face not only social stigma but real struggle to obtain and retain jobs in this already harsh economic climate.",
            "Second, our youths are now exposed to more radicalised views and deliberate efforts of disinformation around the world. We need to actively engage them and have them invested in their stake here in Singapore.",
            "And third, families, due to significant economic pressures, are more exposed to domestic violence. We must do what we can to protect vulnerable groups, like children under the age of 12 or those with mental and physical disabilities.",
            "I welcome the greater resources for these vulnerable groups and those facing domestic violence. Rehabilitation and reintegration efforts for ex-offenders, especially those with drug offences, must be done in concert with their families and strategic social and business partners. We can also adopt technology to tackle recidivism. For instance, a US-based app called Pokket SM, facilitates information sharing and coordination among case workers, probation officers and ex-offenders. Through connecting justice agencies and human service providers, it encourages and sustains self-sufficiency and accountability.",
            "The third part of my speech is on sustainability for future generations. If COVID-19 is a crisis of a generation, then climate change is a crisis for all generations. I applaud the Government’s Green Plan 2030, particularly on agri-food technology, green financing and electric vehicles.",
            "Keat Hong is home to many of our local farms in Lim Chu Kang and Kranji. Hence, the $60 million fund to boost production in the agri-food sector is welcomed. I hope that this will spur adoption of technology and make our food security more resilient.",
            "Next, the plan to support green financing with up to $19 billion of public sector green projects is a good start.",
            "The green bond market is a growing and innovative market, which has grown from US$1.5 billion in 2007 to surpassing US$100 billion in 2019. Green bonds attract a new base of investors and it can advance adoption of innovative new technologies and finance projects that provide green jobs.",
            "Last year, Keat Hong CC played host to a Sustainable Job Fair organised by South West CDC, SembCorp Industries and e2i. It was the first-of-its kind sustainable jobs discovery in the heartlands and part of the South West CDC’s efforts to aggregate jobs in the growing sustainability sector, such as the solar and clean energy. Many thanks to Mayor Low Yen Ling for this.",
            "On green financing, I propose a public awareness campaign on the Singapore Green Plan and building strong partnerships with banks and investors in the region. Green bonds in our region, also extend to non-conventional bonds, like Green Sukuk as well.",
            "Lastly, on electric vehicles or EVs, as stated in my previous filed Parliamentary Question, we should not only look at the infrastructure, but also the legislation and regulatory framework to mandate possibly the installation of more EV charging stations in private residential and commercial carparks. Other possible incentives can be to lower ERP rates for EVs and, with future technology, there can be a \"progressive\" road tax model that charges vehicles not only on time spent on the roads but also on actual carbon emission.",
            "On adoption of EVs, I suggest the Public Service should lead the way by having more EVs and EV charging stations in its premises.",
            "Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to say a few words in Malay before I conclude my speech.",
            "This Budget aims to build on last year’s efforts. We are not yet free from this pandemic. In fact, without last year's budget and support schemes, our economic situation and employment rates this year would have been much worse, unlike the current situation. So, we are not only grateful for the effort, toil and sweat of our frontline workers, but we should also thank all segments of society who have come together to pool their energies and ideas with the Government, to face and combat this pandemic together.",
            "One of the focus areas of this Budget is to further strengthen the social compact of our country. This cannot be achieved without the help of all communities. Each of us plays an important role. Here, I share a quatrain:",
            "This quatrain depicts a highly regarded Malay warrior who is seen as a beacon for those who are struggling to stay afloat or need support to survive.",
            "So, let us all help those in need to stay afloat and give them support.",
            "Mr Speaker, Sir, in summary, we cannot let the difficulties faced by businesses to spiral downwards. Hence, I am glad that there are targeted schemes to help them. We cannot allow disappointment of laid off workers to turn to despair. Hence, we should work to reskill them. We cannot stand for vulnerable groups in our society to be devoid of hope. Hence, we should speak up for them. We cannot kick the can down the road for our children to tackle climate change. Hence, we should tackle it now for them.",
            "I am glad that this is the spirit of Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat’s Budget Statement and it has underscored the actions that will be taken right here, right now.",
            "The theme of this Budget 2021 \"Emerging Stronger Together\" resonates with me. Because if we persevere, stay the course and navigate through the storm, then we will be the ones making the waves in this ocean. Mr Speaker, I support this Budget."

            ": Mr Speaker, Sir, what does one say as the last speaker – sandwiched between the second last speaker and the Deputy Prime Minister? So, I must thank the Leader of the House for giving me this unenviable task. But I will do my best.",
            "Mr Speaker, last year, through the four Budgets, we assisted many Singaporeans in their time of need. I believe this year’s Budget is a continuation of that spirit, that is, timely aid to citizens and companies in need.",
            "Sir, Singaporeans have risen up to the occasion and taken ownership and responsibility in this crisis, helping their neighbours and friends, and giving to those who need it more than themselves. I believe that COVID-19 has shown the world the best of Singapore and how we have stood together to overcome. The pandemic has revealed our common humanity. It is with this spirit – of a common humanity and our common identity as Singaporeans – that I wish to speak today.",
            "My first point is how we should strive towards becoming one united Singaporean family. Multi-culturalism is a significant ingredient in our Singapore tapestry. Unity does not mean homogeneity. In fact, as we continue to embrace multi-culturalism and diversity, and the more we understand the differences and the richness of each culture, the tighter our social fabric becomes.",
            "We do value the diversity in our ethnic heritages. The self-help groups, such as CDAC, SINDA, Mendaki and the Eurasian Association, play important roles in keeping ethnic heritages alive in modern day Singapore. It shows that we value the different cultures inherent in our society and aid each subsequent generation to become familiar with the traditions and outlook of each ethnic group. These self-help groups help their individual communities while also carrying out joint inter-racial events. This helps foster both the bonds within each individual community and also the bonds in the larger Singaporean context.",
            "Another example is the Ethnic Integration Programme within HDB estates. I support this as it is in line with the spirit of enhancing ties between people of various ethnic backgrounds who become neighbours and who then share common environments.",
            "I believe that as we continue to strengthen and understand different ethnic communities, and as our diverse culture and heritage become more and more a part of Singapore, race will become less and less a factor in evaluating a person. In fact, I would dare say that race matters less in the minds of Singaporeans, especially those who are younger, in comparison to their nationality, than that of being Singaporean. I think the identity marker in my age group of Singaporeans and younger is: Singaporean first, and ethnicity second.",
            "But what does that mean for politics? I think that means that when choosing a candidate to lead the Government, the choice must be the best man for the job, regardless of race. Instead of being evaluated based on race, we can evaluate based on more robust factors, such as the person’s character, abilities, values and experience. Politics is about leadership. In my personal view, ceteris paribus, when it comes to leading the Government, I think it should be the best man for the job, regardless of race.",
            "So, if there is a Singaporean Chinese candidate of the right age and with the right character and the right skillset making him the best man for the job, he should be chosen for the job. If there is a Singaporean of a minority race of the right age and with the right character and right skillset to be the best man for the job, I think he should be chosen for the job.",
            "Leadership within the Government comes with years of experience and years of being an elected Member within this House. It could easily be 20 years before an elected Member becomes a Prime Minister and, by that time, the familiarity and connection that people would have with the Minister would count for more than just his race. COVID-19 has shown, more than ever, the need for good government and good leadership of and in government.",
            "I know many people my age and younger do want the best man to lead the Government, regardless of race. Some may say I am being overly idealistic, to the discount of pragmatism. I beg to differ. Why? Because the very idea of a multiracial, multicultural Singapore was an ideal, an aspiration, born, literally, from the tears and the sweat of our founding fathers. And inch by inch, year by year, we grow closer to making it a reality. Are we there yet? I believe we have some way to go. But my wish for Singapore is that, one day – perhaps when deciding the 5G or 6G Prime Minister – race is not used as a trump card or a disqualifying criterion. We are too small a nation to discount a man based on his race. This is my view, based on my personal belief.",
            "Mr Speaker, I hope this House can understand the point I am getting at. I am not saying race is not important. Neither am I saying race should be used to dichotomise and polarise. I am firmly of the view that multi-racial Singapore is important and we should not dilute the significance of race and what it can bring to the table. In fact, it brings such a rich tapestry such that many parts of the world can see themselves in us, in Singapore.",
            "But when it comes to leadership of government, we should not discount anybody because of their race, but instead evaluate the candidate based on who is best for the job. I hold this belief. I know many in my age group and younger hold this belief firmly too. Maybe this will happen in 15 to 20 years' time when the party holding the majority of the House chooses the 5G or 6G Prime Minister of who the 5G or 6G Prime Minister should be. However, it being 20 years away should not deter us from having such conversations now.",
            "I do not want any room for my speech to be misinterpreted. So, let me say categorically that I do believe that our Prime Minister is the best man for the job. And I also do believe that the 4G Ministers have chosen the best man for the job to eventually lead their team. So, nothing in my speech should distract from those conclusions.",
            "The point I am making in this speech is that it should be the best man for the job regardless of race, or dare I say the best person for the job regardless of race, for I do not see why a woman with outstanding leadership ability should be discounted. Look at Angela Merkel – a woman leading a solid government.",
            "Singapore is small. If we were to straightjacket our perception of talent, we could very well lose out on the best person for the job.",
            "Being a Singaporean is the key identity marker in Singaporeans of my age group and younger. The second identity marker – that of race – comes after the first identity marker – which is, being Singaporean.",
            "I mean this personally. It comes from deep within and I would like to share a story that speaks to the heart of these beliefs of mine. My wife and I have four children aged between one and 12 years old. Our second daughter was adopted. Her ethnic lineage is pure Chinese and we adopted her at birth in Singapore.",
            "What happened was that there was a young Singaporean Chinese woman who found out she was pregnant. She decided to carry on with her pregnancy, delivered the baby and put the baby up for adoption. She got in touch with a Christian charity who helped place babies with adoptive families. My wife and I had put our names down with the charity as potential adoptive parents. And then, we received the phone call. My wife and I prayed about it and took the leap of faith in adopting this little Singaporean Chinese baby girl. Today, my daughter is completely part of our family. She is the younger sister to our first daughter and dotes on her two younger siblings. All our children are loved and treated equally, and are being brought up first and foremost as Singaporeans first; and secondly, as Singaporean Eurasians.",
            "So, what then is race? If it is merely defined by virtue of blood lineage, our second daughter would be Chinese. But if it was also defined by culture, then living experience would play a part too. My second daughter put up the Chinese New Year decorations made up of hongbaos around our house this year. But during the Christmas season, she would eat all the Eurasian fare on the dining table, including sugee cake and even ask for seconds. To pre-empt her wondering why she looked a little different from her older sister, my wife and I told her when she was very young, \"You came from your tummy mummy; but you were born in our hearts.\"",
            "It is the same way I view Singapore – we are all given life from our mother's wombs but we are all born with Singapore in our hearts.",
            "So, when I say being Singaporean is the pre-eminent identity marker of a citizen and that race is a secondary identity marker, I believe that firmly. There is no binary lens with which one should view race such that race completely does not matter or always matters to the discount of everything else. It is a spectrum – a spectrum that is a continuum within which my daughter, of Singaporean Chinese lineage and living in a Singaporean Eurasian home, is completely comfortable. Race is an asset to make the tapestry of Singapore culture richer and our identity fuller. So, let it not divide us but unite us in always choosing the right person to lead our Government.",
            "The next point I want to make relates to adoption, a point which I have shared, I care deeply about. If we can create an environment in which couples who are unable to have their own children but who would love to have children and want to adopt can be placed in touch with the database of prospective mothers in Singapore, wanting to offer their babies for adoption, this would benefit both parties. But for this to happen, the pregnant women must be told of this option. I have had discussions with MSF over many years and I hope they will close the loop with me and inform me how the counselling for pregnant women, to ensure that they are aware that adoption is a good and feasible option, has improved.",
            "Mr Speaker, I return to my point about our common humanity. As I have said, the pandemic has shown the strength and depth of our community bonds, as people reached out to those around them and blessed their neighbours and helped the vulnerable.",
            "But there is a particular group of vulnerable people who are not afforded the same protection that other citizens have. These are the stateless people living in Singapore. They do not vote but they, too, need a voice in Parliament. Many have grown up in Singapore and many were even born in Singapore. They live here, work here and have families here. Yet, because their parents failed to register their birth at the time of their birth, some are denied citizenship and live their lives as stateless people. This impacts them in their daily life as some struggle to open bank accounts, buy or rent houses and even find a job. Such difficulties present a very real challenge for them. It leaves them in the lurch and vulnerable.",
            "Today, I have spoken a lot of what it means to be Singaporean. I believe giving stateless people living in Singapore citizenship or at least PR status would go a long way in giving them something to be rooted in – the identity of being a citizen.",
            "Allow me to conclude, Mr Speaker. This pandemic has brought the best out of Singapore. We have something precious here in Singapore. First and foremost, our people. Secondly, our Government working with the people, like a formidable aerobatics team weathering the storm in tight formation. The pandemic has not deterred Singapore's determination to build a better future for our children. The Jewel still stands at Changi Airport. Olive trees still grow on the equator at Gardens by the Bay. And we are not done turning a mudflat into a thriving metropolis.",
            "And inch by inch, yard by yard, we strive in this House – and out there in the streets – to become a more united country, regardless of race. And that is a future worth fighting for. [",

            "I also want to thank Mr Christopher de Souza for his very moving and personal speech of what it means to be a Singaporean. And also let me thank Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Finance and Trade and Industry, for laying out the big picture and key issues clearly.",
            "Mr Liang spoke about supporting our people through the immediate pain of the crisis and the need to take action to emerge stronger. Importantly, he did not shy away from the difficult conversation of how these important measures need to be funded and offered constructive suggestions. This sets the stage for this House to discuss the way forward.",
            "I also thank Ms Foo Mee Har who not only spoke passionately about supporting our people and businesses, but also suggested how to do so in a prudent and sustainable manner.",
            "Over the last few days, the passionate debate went along a few threads. Some Members elevated the debate to help Singaporeans appreciate the changing landscape and the need to act. Some Members highlighted the importance of our reserves, the bold and decisive response mounted and what it achieved. Unfortunately, some argued selectively without acknowledging the broader impact of COVID-19 and the outcomes of the Government's decisive interventions.",
            "Before I dive into the issues raised by Members, I want to situate Budget 2021 and Singapore's future within the larger forces sweeping the world.",
            "Singapore sits at the crossroads between the East and the West. It is a position that we have harnessed to maintain our relevance to the world amid the flux and changing tides of global political and economic developments.",
            "But we cannot take our standing in the world for granted. It is something that we have to painstakingly maintain, as the world and region evolve, so that we remain relevant.",
            "For some time, we have observed the gradual geopolitical and technological shifts. The world was slowly adapting to a rising China, which found its place alongside the US as an economic and military powerhouse. Inevitably, there has been some friction. Fortunately, the deep interdependence of markets and supply chains served as a stabiliser for world order, as well as international trade and commerce.",
            "But COVID-19 disrupted this tenuous equilibrium and accelerated bifurcation and change. Overnight, this virus revealed the vulnerabilities of inter-connected supply chains. The race for vaccines and the rush for economic recovery have also surfaced nationalist tendencies.",
            "These events will play a significant part in countries' and businesses' calculations, as they rebuild their value chains and business networks. Countries will seek for greater onshoring of their key industries for resilience. Businesses may re-think their globalisation strategy and approach, giving more weight to resilience and reliability. Singapore can capitalise on them to emerge stronger, become more competitive and remain relevant to the world.",
            "First, nations and businesses will place a high premium on partners and locations which are reliable and predictable in their dealings. This is where we can leverage the strong Singapore brand, globally trusted for long-term planning, openness and reliability.",
            "Second, as the flow of people pulled back because of the lockdowns, the flow of digital information and knowledge spiked. There is potential for Singapore to ride on the rise of technology adoption and digital economy.",
            "Third, climate change is a threat for humanity. We must do our part, create new opportunities from the global interest in sustainable development.",
            "My Budget Statement laid out our strategic plan to capitalise on our strengths and to double down on our commitment to invest in connectivity, digitalisation, the green economy, and of course, our people.",
            "So, I will round up this Budget Debate by speaking on Members' contributions along three themes: our economic strategy to emerge stronger; a cohesive and liveable Singapore and a prudent fiscal strategy for the long term.",
            "Last year, I committed close to $100 billion to fight this crisis. Since then, I have heard many views on the appropriateness and adequacy of our economic response. Some have called for more support, while others have asked if we are doing too much.",
            "Let me recap the context. COVID-19 has caused the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression. Globally, real GDP is estimated to have fallen by 3.5% in 2020, equivalent to a drop of close to US$ 5 trillion dollars in economic output. Many countries experienced full-year recessions in 2020. Sectors like aviation and tourism felt the brunt of the impact, with 1 billion fewer international arrivals in 2020 – a 74% drop.",
            "Labour markets were disrupted on an unprecedented scale, with 8.8% of global working hours lost relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. This is equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs. Economists also warn of possible scarring, with long-term GDP losses, rising public and corporate debt, higher hurdles on capital spending, and continued rise in unemployment levels.",
            "We disbursed a total of $27.4 billion in grants to provide relief, preserve jobs and help firms build capabilities to pivot to new growth areas – more than 18 times the amount disbursed in 2019. As many Members including Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Desmond Choo thoughtfully reminded us, we narrowly averted a much deeper recession and scarring. Our fiscal and monetary policy measures are estimated to have prevented a further 6.6 percentage points in GDP contraction last year, and mitigated the rise in resident unemployment rates by two percentage points – or about 155,000 jobs.",
            "While our economy contracted sharply in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, the rebound over the next two quarters recouped about 80% of the output lost. More details of our early findings can be found in the interim assessment of the COVID-19 measures that MOF released earlier this year.",
            "The impulses from last year's measures continue to flow through the economy to complement Budget 2021. The combined effects of the two years' Budgets imply a material support to GDP in 2021. Our calibrated strategy to support businesses and protect livelihoods has seen positive outcomes for firms and workers.",
            "We tilted support towards the hardest-hit sectors to help them retain core capabilities and prepare for recovery. Today, some of these sectors are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. For example, with the phased resumption of activities domestically since June 2020, the consumer-facing sectors, including retail and food services, saw a gradual recovery to around 85% of pre-COVID-19 output levels by Q4 in 2020. Many firms have made good use of the support we rolled out.",
            "In 2020, $18 billion worth of loans to 21,000 enterprises were supported by Enterprise Singapore's financing schemes. Almost all recipients were micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs. Enterprise Singapore also supported more than 15,000 companies in raising productivity, going international and undertaking innovation projects. This is 54% more than in 2019. So, I am glad businesses were taking innovation more seriously during this COVID-19 period.",
            "Mindful Movement was one such beneficiary. When COVID-19 struck, the yoga studio halted on-site classes. After consulting an SME Centre, Mindful Movement tapped on the Productivity Solutions Grant to transit their classes online. Today, they continue to offer both online and physical classes, to provide clients greater choice and flexibility. For sectors that remain badly affected, I will continue to provide targeted relief and support to help them transform and reposition themselves for recovery.",
            "On the workers front, the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package has helped to cushion the labour market fall-out and preserve the livelihoods of Singaporeans. Many jobseekers joined industries with a promising growth outlook through the Jobs Growth Incentive, or JGI, and drew the same or higher wages. The Ministry of Manpower will provide more details at the COS.",
            "Nearly 76,000 local jobseekers were placed in jobs and skills opportunities through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills package between April and December last year. Close to 80% of them were placed into jobs. Of these job placements, six in 10 were long-term jobs. Growth sectors such as InfoComm Technology or ICT, healthcare, and manufacturing, accounted for most of the placements.",
            "We tilted support towards mature jobseekers, recognising the higher hurdles they faced with career transitions. Based on preliminary estimates, mature workers aged 40 and above accounted for about half of the first 110,000 JGI beneficiaries, and about half of the 76,000 locals placed in SGUnited jobs and skills opportunities. This includes more than 8,000 mature jobseekers placed last year on career conversion programmes, like the TechSkills Accelerator and Professional Conversion Programmes, or PCPs. These schemes enable trainees to reskill for jobs with good growth prospects. For example, about seven in 10 PCP participants earn higher wages after starting their new jobs.",
            "Mr Goh Che Yong has been in tourism for close to 24 years, dealing in traditional sales for walk-in customers. He witnessed the digital disruption to the industry. At 55 years-young, Che Yong embarked on the Professional Conversion Programme for Digital Sales Executive with Siam Express last March. Although he was still in the same travel industry, moving from traditional to digital sales was not easy. But with the structured training, he gained confidence. Che Yong now applies his newly acquired digital skills in his job and enjoys exploring new ways of packaging holidays for a post-COVID world.",
            "We averted a \"COVID generation\" of workers and students by preserving human capital and enhancing their employability. Compared to the 2019 cohort, although full-time permanent employment fell by about 10 percentage points, overall employment rates for this year's fresh IHL graduates remained similar to past years. In particular, 94% of autonomous university graduates in 2020 found employment or got into a traineeship within six months, compared to 91% in 2019.",
            "The SGUnited Traineeships programme has contributed significantly to this outcome. It has placed close to 5,400 recent graduates into traineeships, to help them gain useful skills and industry experience, and prepare them for the recovery. Some have already landed full-time jobs.",
            "Mr Chen Jiahao embarked on a traineeship last year with Taiger Singapore, an Artificial Intelligence, or AI start-up. Although he had no prior experience in AI or data science, the traineeship enabled Jiahao to pursue his dream of working in deep tech. He picked up new skills quickly and developed a Natural Language Processing model to perform information extraction. Taiger was impressed by Jiahao's strong performance and hired him as a full-time Junior Software Engineer within six months of the start of his traineeship.",
            "In this Budget, I also extended the JGI to September 2021. I hope this encourages more employers to convert trainees to employees in a timely manner. Overall, we have managed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our young. While unemployment rate amongst our young increased by two percentage points from September 2019 to September 2020, it remained well below that in EU countries.",
            "I would like to thank Members including Dr Shahira Abdullah for speaking on the importance of safeguarding the future of our youth, and I assure this House that this remains a key priority.",
            "Looking back, the waters of 2020 have been rough. But we have kept our ship intact, with all hands on deck pulling together to navigate it out of the storm. In 2021, our suite of support measures, including the further extension to the JSS, the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, and targeted support for the worst-hit sectors, will continue to provide a stabilising effect on our economy, amid uncertainties and risks in the global economy.",
            "Domestically, the pace of border re-opening has slowed amid the global surge in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of new virus strains. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 situation within Singapore remains under control. Against this backdrop, the Singapore economic recovery over the course of the year is expected to be gradual and uneven across sectors. Outward-oriented sectors are expected to benefit from the pick-up in external demand, while domestic industries improve as activities safely resume. Overall, the GDP growth forecast for 2021 is estimated at 4% to 6%.",
            "Now is the time to chart our course, position ourselves to catch the winds of opportunity and sail boldly in a reshaped world. That is the focus of this year’s Emerging Stronger Together Budget. I thank Prof Hoon Hian Teck for his insightful comments on how this Budget has struck a balance between stabilisation and transformation.",
            "The COVID-19 Resilience Package continues to provide near-term support to safeguard lives, jobs, supply chains, and core capabilities. At the same time, we are also dedicating substantial fiscal resources towards raising the productive capacity of the economy in the medium to long term.",
            "I also applaud our Labour Movement, led by Secretary-General Mr Ng Chee Meng, for their excellent contributions to this debate. Let me underscore three important points from our Labour Movement.",
            "First, as Deputy Secretary-General Mr Heng Chee How mentioned, the way forward is as much about being Stronger Together, as it is about Emerging Stronger. A number of our businesses and workers will hold their own against the best in the world. But at the end of the day, we compete as one Team Singapore, not worker by worker, or enterprise by enterprise. It is the strength of our collective capabilities and connectedness, as an economy and as a society, that will determine how far we will go.",
            "Second, several Members, including Deputy Secretary-General Dr Koh Poh Koon, highlighted the synergies between firms and workers. The fortunes of businesses and workers are inextricably linked, more so today than ever. Demand shocks caused by COVID-19 have exacerbated labour market dislocations and skills mismatches. Coupled with the structural shift of shorter technology cycles, it will be increasingly difficult for firms to find candidates with the perfect skill sets.",
            "So, I urge businesses to look beyond hiring just \"plug-and-play\" workers, and see the potential within jobseekers to learn and grow in your firms.",
            "I am glad to see our local banking community leading the way in grooming new fintech talent like Ms Choo Cui Ling through career conversion. After working in IT audit, Cui Ling enrolled in the Technology in Finance Immersion Programme with OCBC Bank. A few months into her attachment, she was converted into a full-time employee. She now helps to coordinate information risk management for the bank in her role as Assistant Manager.",
            "At the same time, jobseekers should keep an open mind, be receptive to new and different job roles, and take the initiative to build new skills.",
            "Third, I am heartened by the Labour Movement’s forward-looking approach on bringing firms and workers together to ride the waves of change and emerge stronger. Technological advancements promise new possibilities as well as challenges. As Mr Melvin Yong starkly put, \"every job is at risk\". \"Working from home\" will also mean \"Working from anywhere\" – so job competition can come from any corner of the globe with an internet link. For our businesses, while e-commerce opens them to a global pool of customers, it also opens their customers to the global pool of sellers.",
            "As Mr Liang Eng Hwa highlighted, our $24 billion action plan over the next three years is about pursuing our medium to longer term economic imperatives, even as we tackle the immediate challenges. This seeks to give our workers and businesses a distinct advantage in the global marketplace.",
            "We will build an eco-system that fosters a virtuous cycle of innovation and knowledge transfer. This includes $4.4 billion of the on-going $8.3 billion Transformation and Growth strategy I announced at the Unity Budget last year, to deepen enterprise capabilities and upskill workers. Another $19.6 billion of fresh funding will go toward new digitalisation measures and enhanced enterprise development support, as well as worker support measures such as the extension of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills package to support jobseekers in upskilling and accessing employment opportunities.",
            "Together, these measures seek to stimulate private investment over a longer horizon and boost the supply-side capacity of the post-COVID economy. This will help Singapore capitalise on the post-COVID economic recovery and emerge stronger. This Emerging-Stronger component of the Budget therefore has a strong medium-term orientation through an enduring effect on supporting the level of labour productivity in the economy.",
            "Members including Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim spoke about what the post-COVID-19 world means for Singapore’s economy. To pave the way for our next lap of growth, we must make the following moves.",
            "First, we must remake Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. This requires enhancing our connectivity, including digital connectivity, and positioning our firms and workers at the intersection of key global chains growing out of Asia and ASEAN nations.",
            "Second, as Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlighted, we must shift to a technologically advanced, innovation-driven economy, where firms and workers are equipped with the skills to harness technology and intangible assets as a key differentiator.",
            "Third, we must invest in economic resilience and sustainability as a source of competitive advantage.",
            "Building on previous Budgets, Budget 2021 invests in our economic toolkit to support these moves – or as Mr Shawn Huang aptly summarised, to \"survive, pivot and develop an edge to seize opportunities of the future\". If we get this right, we can set our economy on a path of growth for the next five to 10 years.",
            "Building a stronger Singapore Core is at the heart of our approach, as several Members including Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Abdul Samad rightly noted. The ultimate goal of economic growth is to improve the jobs and lives of Singaporeans. The only way to sustain such improvements is by raising productivity, where firms transform in ways that bring workers along.",
            "We build from a position of strength. From 2016 to 2019, labour productivity growth, measured in terms of real value-added per actual hour worked, grew by 2.7% per year, up from 2.2% per year in the preceding three-year period. Real median income of Singaporeans increased by 3.7% per year, higher than the 3.2% per year growth in the preceding three-year period.",
            "The crisis in 2020 interrupted this progress. Still, real median income of Singaporeans grew 1.5% year-on-year, while unemployment was higher in 2020 than in 2019. Dr Tan Wu Meng spoke about our $19 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020, or RIE 2020 plan, and its potential returns on investment.",
            "RIE is a cornerstone of Singapore’s efforts to develop as an innovation-led economy and society with good jobs for Singaporeans. The payoffs from investments in research take time to manifest. We have nevertheless made good progress and the results are promising.",
            "One example is in the biomedical sciences, where Singapore’s RIE investments since 2000 have helped set the foundation for the flourishing sector it is today. Since 2000, the value-added of the biomedical manufacturing sector has grown by more than three times. Today, the biomedical sector makes up almost 4% of GDP, and four of the world’s top 10 drugs by global revenue are made in Singapore.",
            "We have also established capabilities to develop innovative solutions to national challenges, including in managing the pandemic. Our researchers have worked with local companies to develop and manufacture diagnostic test kits, such as the Fortitude 2.0 test kit, that are now used both locally and in more than 45 countries worldwide.",
            "All of these would not have been possible without our sustained investments to build up our RIE capabilities over many years.",
            "Members including Ms Poh Li San have underscored the importance of supporting businesses to emerge stronger. The uneven impact of COVID-19 across industries and enterprises means that each enterprise segment requires different support to recover, grow and thrive.",
            "I agree with Mr Edward Chia on the need to adopt a differentiated, life-cycle approach to enterprise development. Our agencies offer a holistic suite of support schemes targeted at the needs of each enterprise segment, by sector and growth stage. And we approach it not just at the company-level, but at the industry-level, to achieve value-chain transformation.",
            "I spoke about the Built Environment sector coming together to transform decisively across developers, consultants, contractors and suppliers. We will build on our Alliances for Action to enable more industries to transform together.",
            "We will continue to invest in future engines of growth to create new opportunities for our firms and workers.",
            "Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Miss Cheryl Chan spoke about the importance of nurturing and harnessing the growth of the green economy. This is an important area. The green economy is a key part of the future economy. Making bold investments now will give us a head-start and create many good jobs for Singaporeans in future.",
            "We will work with businesses to meet the rising demand for more sustainable products and services. We committed resources to sustainability efforts under our Research, Innovation and Enterprise or RIE 2020, and will allocate even more for this in the next five years.",
            "Helping local SMEs expand their potential remains a focus. Most of our workers are employed in SMEs, so the success of SMEs will enable our workers to have better jobs and better pay.",
            "Budget 2021 builds on a large existing base of measures, to provide significant enhanced support for SMEs to digitalise, innovate, and transform to seize new opportunities. For example, to encourage more local SMEs to embark on transformation efforts and venture abroad, I extended the support levels of the Productivity Solutions Grant, the Enterprise Development Grant and the Market Readiness Assistance grant until March 2022.",
            "And as several Members of Parliament and Mr Mark Chay observed, the pandemic has forced many to take an extraordinary digital leap. To help firms confidently take this leap forward, we have also introduced a suite of digitalisation support, including the Chief Technology Officer-as-a-Service initiative and the Digital Leaders Programme. The Ministry of Communications and Information will announce more details at the COS.",
            "We have also provided substantial support to SMEs through last year’s Budgets. On a per dollar of value-added basis, smaller firms received three to seven times the amount of support given to larger firms in 2020.",
            "As I mentioned earlier, we take an eco-system approach to economic development, to support workers and companies across all sectors to reach their full potential. Mr Leon Perera pointed to the synergy of having MNCs and SMEs work together – let me add that this synergy is not just between MNCs and SMEs, but across all companies and sectors – from Large Local Enterprises to SMEs, and even among SMEs.",
            "Our economic agencies actively support companies in their efforts to transfer capabilities to upskill our local workers. This includes the PACT scheme to support knowledge transfer and co-innovation activities between large enterprises and their local suppliers, and initiatives on knowledge transfer and skills training, such as the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative. The Ministry of Trade and Industry will elaborate on this at the COS.",
            "I have covered how we will sustain a virtuous eco-system of innovative and competitive firms that support a vibrant economy. All of these efforts serve to create opportunities for our people.",
            "To help workers capture these opportunities and enjoy the fruits of growth, we have moved into helping workers get into growth areas, and equipping them with skills to secure sustainable livelihoods.",
            "Our immediate priority is to build upon the skills and experience that workers have accumulated, while breaking down barriers so that they can access new jobs. As Mr Abdul Samad put it, not just to equip workers with skills today, but also to prepare them for jobs of tomorrow.",
            "Mr Vikram Nair asked about measures to support employment. We will continue to support our jobseekers’ career growth through the labour market recovery, including through the extension and recalibration of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package.",
            "Mr Sam Ong was amongst the 7,200 jobseekers who enrolled in the SGUnited Skills programme last year. He was retrenched from an offshore construction company in the oil and gas industry due to the impact of COVID-19 and the industry downturn. Sam recognised the importance of digital skills amid the future job market and enrolled in the Building and Construction Authority’s SGUnited Skills Diploma in Integrated Digital Delivery. He found the course useful and looks forward to securing a role in a company that would allow him to apply his new skills.",
            "To equip workers with industry-relevant skills, we are partnering market leaders to conduct quality training at scale. For example, Google, Boston Consulting Group and Siemens are partnering SkillsFuture Singapore to offer SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways programmes in ICT, professional services and advanced manufacturing. These help local jobseekers adapt to the changing technology trends in a shifting labour market. Our company partners have collectively committed more than 6,000 training places and enrolled more than 2,500 trainees. I am confident that these efforts will put our workers in a stronger position to seize new opportunities in the recovering economy.",
            "Mr Patrick Tay has highlighted employability and job security as top concerns of workers. These are important and closely interlinked focus areas in our medium-term jobs and skills strategy.",
            "The employment landscape is evolving rapidly, with technology being a key driver and enabler. Some jobs are becoming redundant, while new ones are created.",
            "Hence, job security is fundamentally about staying employable, rather than staying employed in the same job. We will thus continue to strengthen the skills eco-system, which comprises workers, businesses, unions and trade associations and chambers or TACs, through SkillsFuture. Let me touch on efforts to enhance the employability of every worker.",
            "First, the efforts of our workers. I am heartened to see more Singaporeans making good use of our support to take ownership of learning and acquire skills, even in the midst of the pandemic. More than 188,000 Singaporeans used their SkillsFuture Credit in 2020, a 21% increase in participation from 2019.",
            "Mr Melvin Tan is one of them. After a 23-year-long career in architecture and project management, he switched to the healthcare sector, so as to better care for his ageing parents. He became a freelance home care-giver last year to provide home-based care-giving for seniors. When the SGUnited Skills programme was launched, Melvin decided to enrol in the Therapy Assistant course at HMI Institute. Using his SkillsFuture Credits, he was fully covered for the subsidised course fee of $500. Melvin is keen to continue his journey in the healthcare industry as a Therapy Assistant when he completes the course this year and I wish him all the best!",
            "Second, businesses playing their part, to enable workers to build skills. Our firms have come onboard to make workplace learning a priority. Since 2018, the National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning has helped about 180 enterprises per year implement or enhance workplace learning processes. Last year, 3,400 enterprises sent their employees for training in courses supported under the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit, and about 250 enterprises benefited from partnerships with SkillsFuture anchor companies to enhance their employee skills development and workplace learning capabilities.",
            "Deputy Secretary-General Dr Koh Poh Koon highlighted that upskilling and job redesign must come together for pervasive transformation. By redesigning jobs and training workers to take up the new jobs, employers not only help workers stay employed, but also enable the firms to thrive.",
            "We will continue to provide strong support to companies on this front. This includes operation and technology roadmapping, or OTR, that integrates upskilling to achieve a long-term growth strategy.",
            "Environmental services company SembWaste, in partnership with the Building Construction and Timber Industries Employees' Union and the NTUC Training and Transformation, formed the Company Training Committee and embarked on an OTR process to develop a five-year business growth strategy to support Singapore's green targets. And to support these transformation plans, SembWaste is upskilling its workers in areas such as digital technology. It has also adopted the Progressive Wage Model to ensure sustainable wage increases tied to skills and productivity growth.",
            "Third, our unions and TACs can reach out to more firms and promote deeper collaboration between firms and workers. For example, the Singapore Business Federation, or SBF, in partnership with Workforce Singapore, leads the Industry 4.0 Human Capital Initiative, to help companies adopt Industry 4.0 through job redesign. To-date, close to 70 companies have come on board, to potentially uplift more than 1,000 jobs and generate more than $52.5 million in cost savings. SBF aims to scale this to benefit up to 300 companies and 1,500 workers by September 2022.",
            "I also thank the Labour Movement for their tireless efforts in supporting the lifelong employability of workers, across different segments with different needs.",
            "NTUC Job Security Council and Company Training Committees are an important innovation for NTUC to partner companies and the Government, to achieve synergy. By pre-emptively matching at-risk workers to new employers, the Job Security Council helps workers minimise employment downtime and aids businesses to manage fluctuating manpower needs. I am heartened to hear that it has successfully placed more than 28,000 workers in new positions last year.",
            "Ms Janet Ang and Mr Patrick Tay have spoken about the importance of ensuring fair access to employment opportunities for Singaporeans, while remaining open to global talent to complement local capabilities. I agree.",
            "I thank Members for agreeing that harnessing complementarities among our Singaporean Core and the different talent sources is important for us to remain as a vibrant and competitive economy. MOM will elaborate on this at the COS.",
            "As Mr Henry Kwek mentioned, our TACs can support firms and workers to emerge stronger, by helping them to transform in a pervasive and sustained way.",
            "Over the past year, I am encouraged to see TACs rallying the business community together to fight the crisis.",
            "The SG Together Enhancing Enterprise Resilience, or STEER fund, which I enhanced at last year's Resilience Budget, has matched more than $10 million across 10 industry-led funds to help the business community tackle challenges arising from COVID-19. Over 2,700 businesses are expected to benefit from these initiatives.",
            "This includes the $1 million Singapore Contractors Association Limited, or SCAL COVID-19 Fund, set up to help construction sector firms cope with the increased operational requirements due to COVID-19. Some 500 member SMEs will stand to benefit from this Fund. Apart from STEER, the Fund also received contributions from BCA, over 50 SCAL members and the SBF Foundation Compassion Fund that Ms Janet Ang spoke about in her speech.",
            "The Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, or SMCCI, also formed a COVID-19 taskforce in March last year, to support members affected by the crisis. It set up an emergency hotline, organised individual outreach sessions to about 400 members, provided legal advice to those in need, and connected businesses to available Government support measures. SMCCI also showcased members who transformed their businesses in the wake of COVID-19 on their specially curated platform, \"Discussions @ Dewan\", so that others can learn from their successes.",
            "The SBF has also been working closely with the National Jobs Council and 31 TACs, to conduct job matching on a business-to-business level, both within and across sectors. Since the start of the pandemic, SBF has assisted more than 600 companies and more than 100 workers have been successfully matched to 77 companies.",
            "Through these collaborations, our firms and workers can emerge stronger in a post-COVID world. And as you can see, this is a case where really everyone is putting in their effort and working together.",
            "Members like Mr Lim Biow Chuan spoke about how Singapore has come out relatively unscathed from COVID-19, and how we are starting from solid ground.",
            "Looking around the world, beyond the economic impact, we also see broader health and social impacts.",
            "One year on, some countries have not recovered from the initial wave of the outbreak. Many are still seeing new COVID-19 cases in the thousands each day, and repeated cycles of lockdowns. This has wrought havoc on their communities, disrupting livelihoods and day-to-day activities. People are putting the future on hold to focus on surviving the crisis.",
            "In December 2020, UNESCO reported that, globally, classrooms for nearly one in five school children were closed. In some countries, healthcare services are still overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases, leaving little help for those with other needs.",
            "In Singapore, many of us have resumed our daily activities. Jobs and opportunities to learn new skills remain available. Our young children are back in schools physically and equipped with digital devices for learning. I thank Mr Louis Ng for showing his appreciation for our teachers in our schools.",
            "We are looking forward to the future and are working towards our dreams.",
            "Demand for BTO flats remains strong even in these uncertain times. As we heard from Mr Lim Biow Chuan earlier, people are still looking to buy cars \"as if there was no recession at all\"!",
            "While we should count our blessings, let us not forget that we are still in the eye of a raging global storm – there are still challenges ahead and there are still individuals and families who are under stress.",
            "Budget 2021 focuses our efforts and resources on emerging stronger. I have shared how we are taking a long-term view and working to support transformation of our economy and workers.",
            "But I want to assure Members that the Government has also been putting in place multiple layers of support, which will continue to provide targeted, customised relief to help Singaporeans differently affected by COVID-19 and the uneven, K-shaped recovery.",
            "First, we have broad-based, permanent schemes to provide strong social support and safety nets that protects all Singaporeans, especially the vulnerable. When the crisis hit, we layered on temporary assistance on top of some of these permanent schemes to provide additional support to vulnerable groups. We also introduced new measures like the Solidarity Payment and Care and Support – Cash to provide quick relief for Singaporeans' day-to-day expenses, and with the lower income receiving more. Finally, for those whose livelihoods were disrupted, we stepped in to provide some bridging support as they picked themselves up, for example, through the COVID-19 Support Grant and Temporary Relief Fund.",
            "We cushioned the vulnerable against the worst of the crisis and mitigated social inequality. As a result of these efforts, our Gini coefficient after taxes and transfers is at a record low, as this chart shows. [",
            "Please refer to",
            "Annex 2",
            ".",
            "]",
            "Mr Pritam Singh pointed out the divergence between the data on inequality, and the lived experience on the ground. He was quoting a particular report. We are fully aware that there are families who have been deeply impacted by the pandemic, and some more than others. This is exactly why we have tilted our support significantly towards the lower income and vulnerable groups, and Government has partnered the community to reach out to those groups during this period. Mr Singh himself noted that there was and I quote, \"not-insignificant\" support. So, you have to see the support in totality – the full set of support – and not conclude from one sample because these are rigorous study of what his happening throughout Singapore.",
            "Members, including Mr Patrick Tay, Prof Hoon Hian Teck and Mr Louis Chua suggested that we study the viability of an unemployment insurance for workers affected by involuntary employment.",
            "In the midst of significant disruption, interim, bridging support is needed to tide workers over. The COVID-19 Recovery Grant will support our workers who need more help while they find new jobs or go for training during this period.",
            "Longer term, while an unemployment insurance appears attractive, this would not be sustainable without longer-term structures to help our workers bounce back. This sentiment is echoed in other countries like Germany, Sweden and South Korea, where unemployment insurance schemes are linked to active labour market policy measures which seek to get the affected worker back into a job quickly and avoid skills atrophy.",
            "An unemployment insurance would also have its complexities, as Prof Hoon and Mr Tay have pointed out. Instead, as Mr Xie Yao Quan said, a job is the best welfare. It is more sustainable to ensure that workers maintain a source of income, and to up-skill and re-skill our workers so that they can bounce back quickly from job disruptions.",
            "But at the same time, I recognise that as the global economy goes through an even faster pace of change, the nature of jobs and skills will be changing faster too. We will partner our business leaders, Labour Movement and academics to study how to support employability and help those who falter, through measures that suit our context.",
            "Mr Gerald Giam claimed that our middle income receive little support for their cost of living. Others like Ms Jessica Tan have raised concerns that the middle income may have been missed in the short-term support measures. I would like to remind Members of this House that the bulk of every Budget goes towards uplifting all members of our society, including the broad swathe of our middle class.",
            "In this Budget, I have set aside a total of $42 billion for our social spending and transfers, 35% more than FY2019. This is on top of: our security spending, which ensures the safety of our people and allows property and asset prices to rise over time, in line with our economic fundamentals, our investments in the economy which ensure that our people have access to good jobs for many years to come. And we have different schemes and components in our support packages. Some target those with less means. Others, like the upcoming CDC Vouchers, are provided to all, including our middle class.",
            "So, we should not look at each Budget in terms of \"goodies for me\", but whether the totality of the spending creates more opportunities for us and our children.",
            "I fully understand the aspirations of our middle class earners. It is natural that we want to do better for ourselves each passing year. Like Ms Janet Ang has said, the Singapore Dream is a work-in-progress. We wish for every future generation to be better off than the last. So, let me reiterate the measures that the Government has put in place to support these.",
            "First, we have quality housing, which is affordable to all Singaporeans.",
            "Let me share how we are doing. Even in land-scarce Singapore, you can see in this chart [",
            "Please refer to",
            "Annex 3",
            ".",
            "], our housing prices are lower than those of many major international cities, even before accounting for grants. We provide housing subsidies to keep HDB flats affordable. The current income ceiling of $14,000 allows eight in 10 Singaporeans to buy a subsidised HDB flat. As a result of our housing policies, around 80% of new HDB flat buyers have little or no cash outlay on their mortgage payments, meaning they do not have to come up with cash, or little cash, for their mortgage payments; and nine in 10 Singaporean households own their homes. Our homes may not be the largest or the cheapest, but we definitely have well-built, affordable housing options, in a safe, secure and green environment.",
            "Next, we have strong support for couples who want to raise a family. Miss Cheng Li Hui and Ms Hany Soh asked for more to be done to support parenthood and first-time parents. Over the years, the Government has strengthened support for families with children, to defray the cost of education and childcare, through a combination of broad-based grants, subsidies and tax benefits. Upon the birth of their child, a Singaporean family would receive up to $35,000 in cash and cash-like benefits, through the Baby Bonus and other benefits. This includes a $4,000 MediSave grant which covers the child’s MediShield Life premiums from birth till age 21. Every Singaporean child can also receive over $180,000 in education subsidies by the time he or she turns 16, including pre-school subsidies.",
            "Even more support is available for those who come from less-privileged backgrounds. I thank Minister of State Sun Xueling, Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam and the other women Members for speaking on the different ways that the Government, businesses and the community can support women to fulfil their aspirations and help them to better support their families. These include job opportunities, support for their jobs and livelihoods, re-designing jobs for more progressive workplaces, encouraging higher technology adoption amongst women, and support for care-giving. These are good points which we can continue to work together.",
            "Children also have access to an affordable education, supported by nurturing teachers, which ensures that our children are equipped with important knowledge and skills to perform to the best of their potential. We nurture our students’ aspirations and continue to develop multiple pathways to enable our students to learn, including through industry attachments.",
            "Third, I assure Mr Louis Chua that we remain committed to helping all seniors retire with greater peace of mind through the CPF system. The Silver Support Scheme provides support for our seniors who had low incomes during their working years and need additional support in retirement. Over the next five years, to help more Singaporeans meet the Basic Retirement Sum, we will also be providing an additional boost through the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme. We are also in a fortunate position where most of our seniors have housing assets which they could use to support their retirement, if they choose to.",
            "Last but not least, the Government provides good and affordable healthcare to all Singaporeans, especially our seniors. We have been investing in our healthcare system, to meet the needs of an ageing population. We have almost tripled our healthcare spending, from $3.9 billion in 2011 to $11.3 billion in FY2019. This went into expanding healthcare capacity and enhancing healthcare subsidies. We now spend more than twice the amount on patient subsidies than we did 10 years ago and expect to spend more as our population ages. On average, a Singaporean can expect to receive about $200,000 in Government healthcare subsidies throughout their lifetime.",
            "As a result, we do well in terms of health outcomes. I thank Dr Tan Yia Swam who has registered her confidence and, I quote: \"I am confident that our healthcare system is robust and can provide adequate care for all citizens\". Indeed, Singapore ranks amongst the top for the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, which measures the ability of a child to reach his or her full potential if they had full health and complete, high-quality education. We also do well in the Bloomberg Health-Efficiency Index, which measures life expectancy as compared to medical spending. In 2019, our average life expectancy at birth was 84.9 years, with health-adjusted life expectancy of 74.5 years. Globally, Singaporeans are expected to live the longest!",
            "Ms Hany Soh will be glad to know that we have put in strong support for young parents. A young couple buying a HDB flat near their parents could benefit from more than $134,000 in support in this year alone. Besides housing grants, the support includes pre-school subsidies to help with the education of their child, healthcare subsidies, and also offsets for expenses through the Household Support Package.",
            "Another example is a multi-generational family that already owns their 5-room HDB flat, supporting a Pioneer Generation senior with disabilities. The family could receive over $35,000 in support this year in education and healthcare subsidies, including $1,200 from the Household Support Package. And these are over and above the housing subsidies that the family would have enjoyed when it first bought the flat. Neither family needs to pay their MediShield Life and CareShield Life premium in cash. No one will lose coverage due to inability to pay.",
            "So, with the most important items in life well taken care of, I hope Members like Mr Leong Mun Wai will agree that his position that our support is, I quote, \"ad hoc, short-term and unpredictable\" is wrong. In fact, our support is systematic, well-structured and balanced.",
            "Singaporeans can be assured that: they can always have a home to call their own; that they can expect their children are being well-nurtured in a world-class education system, which will prepare them well to take on good jobs and fulfil their potential; that we will provide assurance to our seniors over their retirement; and that the healthcare needs of their family will always be well taken care of.",
            "Now, it is also natural for us to look out for \"what is new\" in every Budget. But it is important for all of us to appreciate what is already there, and to see the Budget in totality, over the years. Individual Budget measures are useful enhancements which sit on top of our already significant social spending. Over the past decade, we have been gradually tilting the tax and transfer system in favour of lower and middle income groups. On average, lower income citizen households can expect to receive benefits, net of taxes, of $6,500 per household member in 2021. Members of middle income households can expect to receive $3,500 in 2021. The highest income households instead pay about $9,500 in taxes, net of benefits, per household member.",
            "Members of this House – Mr Darryl David and Mr Faisal Manap – have welcomed the salary increase for healthcare workers and have asked for salaries for other frontline workers and sectors to be enhanced. As I have said in the Budget Statement, there are good, meaningful jobs in healthcare for our locals, and it is important to pay them the salary that they deserve – commensurate with the work that they do. This is how we are able to attract and retain locals in the long-term, even as other markets compete for our Singaporean talents.",
            "As Mr Saktiandi Supaat pointed out, Ms Hazel Poa’s conclusion that our workers are worse off due to lower wage share of GDP is wrong. A capital-intensive economy open to investment and trade can have lower wage shares than labour-intensive economies. For example, in the biomedical sector, the wage share of the sector’s output is less than 6% compared to over 60% in the accommodation and food services sectors. But workers in the biomedical sector earn more than twice that of the accommodation and food services sector. So, what will improve the lives of our workers are better wages and better prospects, not the aggregate share. What matters more is that the wage growth of our workers is in line with productivity so that it is sustainable.",
            "Several Members, including Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman, spoke about the need to continue boosting the incomes of lower wage workers, and the Progressive Wage Models. Indeed, there has been some progress. Citizens’ real incomes from 2016 to 2019 at the 20th percentile grew at 4.4% per annum, faster than the median at 3.7% per annum.",
            "I thank the Labour Movement for their strong support for the Government’s vision of progressive employment, which is shared by many caring Singaporeans.",
            "Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Desmond Choo have also called for more help for our self-employed. We have been studying for some time how best to boost protections and retirement adequacy for this group. MOM will continue working with the Labour Movement and our industry partners, through the tripartite mechanism, to uplift the incomes of all our lower wage workers and support those in the gig economy. MOM will share more on this at COS.",
            "Helping lower wage workers and self-employed persons is a work-in-progress. I hope that, if some of the new measures lead to a modest increase in costs, caring Singaporeans will agree that this is worth doing for solidarity.",
            "Some members, like Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Yip Hon Weng, have highlighted another group of concern – our older workers.",
            "I thank NTUC FairPrice for its efforts to support our older workers who wish to remain active in the workforce. As Mr Seah Kian Peng has shared, this is an example of a company which has fully utilised the reservoir of talent in its mature workforce.",
            "To build on this momentum for all sectors, we are pushing ahead with our plans to raise the retirement and re-employment ages in 2022, with the Government and the Labour Movement taking the lead by effecting this in 2021. I thank Deputy Secretary-General Mr Heng Chee How for reaffirming the need for this move.",
            "NUH is one of the organisations taking the initiative by redesigning jobs, offering flexible working arrangements and training opportunities for their senior workers in collaboration with the Healthcare Services Employees' Union. Senior Staff Nurse Mdm Badthu Manne Doraisamy has been working with NUH for 31 years. She has benefited from NUH’s strong support for senior workers. Mr Agos Salim Sapuan is a security supervisor at NUH. He shared how everything at his job is digitalised now, and he is no longer making manual entries in logbooks! I am sure he has benefited from NUH’s many training opportunities. I hope that the Government’s Senior Worker Support Package will encourage more businesses to retain their mature workers and tap on their wealth of experience.",
            "Ms Ng Ling Ling and Mr Eric Chua have asked the Government to do more to encourage the hiring of persons with disabilities, or PwDs. Helping every Singaporean achieve their potential is a key priority for us in building an inclusive society. We agree that more can be done, and there are plans in the pipeline. The MSF will share more about this in the coming months.",
            "As Members have highlighted, there are specific groups of Singaporeans who have been deeply affected by COVID-19 and remain so. We have seen this all over the world. Dr Wan Rizal spoke on the issue of mental health. Ms Joan Pereira, on the support needed for care-givers. Ms Rachel Ong and Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin spoke on the employment and re-integration of ex-offenders and youth-at-risk, as well as Mr Don Wee on families with children with special needs.",
            "Ms Denise Phua and Ms Carrie Tan spoke yesterday on how the CDCs are partnering Social Service Agencies, or SSAs, to multiply their reach for the vulnerable in the community. They have also asked to rally the community to help.",
            "BlockBox is good example of partnership. To support seniors with chronic disease management and to address issues of social isolation due to COVID-19, students from NUS and Yale University created a community space and monthly health subscription boxes to track seniors' health and keep them engaged. For the pilot, the team received seed funding from MOH and sponsorship from the private sector.",
            "This is the spirit of SG Together.",
            "But the Government can only do so much alone. As Ms Carrie Tan said, we must look into the, I quote, \"Sharing of Care\". I am sure that she will be glad to hear that we will continue to push ahead with our plans to develop deeper capabilities in the social sector.",
            "I announced last year that we will partner ToteBoard to jointly commit up to $350 million to support the Community Capability Trust over the next 10 years. This will drive capability- and capacity-building efforts within the social services sector, to enhance SSAs' ability to serve the community.",
            "Like Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Derrick Goh have said, we must do more to \"bridge the digital divide\" and \"grow our digital muscles\", especially during COVID-19.",
            "We refreshed our plans to ensure that no one will be left behind in this digital age.",
            "The Seniors Go Digital programme equips seniors with digital skills.",
            "For low-income and vulnerable families with children or PwDs, MCI's NEU PC Plus programme connects them to broadband access, and laptops to support their learning.",
            "And who best to be our ambassadors of the digital world than our young people! Under MCCY's and the National Youth Council's YouthTech Programme, youths will be deployed to businesses and organisations in diverse sectors, including the community and social sector organisations to support their digitalisation efforts.",
            "We will also need to boost the digital and technological transformation of the social sector. Good ideas have come from the businesses who are partnering SSAs to do good and supplement the human touch with the human \"click\".",
            "For example, Engineering Good, a non-profit organisation is working with community partners to provide digital access through refurbished laptops and Internet connectivity to low-income families, coupled with digital literacy and skills programmes as part of its Building Digitally Inclusive Communities project.",
            "This is the spirit of Emerging Stronger Together.",
            "Mr Christopher de Souza said we need to embrace our multi-culturalism and diversity, and spoke about what it means to be a Singaporean, regardless of race, language or religion. And indeed, we are stronger together when we look after one another, and build a society that leaves no one behind.",
            "At the end of the day, our success is not measured in terms of GDP, but in the society and community we build together.",
            "Besides fostering a caring and inclusive community, we must ensure our clean living environment endures for future generations to enjoy.",
            "I thank Members like Ms Poh Li San for supporting the Government's sustainability plans. I am glad that Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, one of the youngest Members, if not the youngest Member of this House, also spoke in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. But we must not take our environment, whether green or blue, for granted – or for the matter, our reserves.",
            "What we have today is a testament to the foresight and hard work put in by many to distinguish Singapore as a City in Nature over the years. We made a big effort to improve our sanitation systems and clean up the Singapore River in the 1960s to 1980s. We launched the Clean and Green Week in 1990 to encourage an environmentally conscious lifestyle. To improve our air quality, we started encouraging the adoption of cleaner vehicle alternatives as far back as 2001. Climate change and environmental sustainability did not become a priority overnight. We have been protecting our home.",
            "Members like Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Dennis Tan have questioned why the Government is raising the petrol duty expecting many drivers can and will switch to Electric Vehicles, or EV, before the infrastructure is ready.",
            "Now, this is not the case. The petrol duty adjustments are to set price signals and change behaviour. Just like how we have made deliberate decisions to protect our environment, we want people to make conscious choices about how to drive, how much to drive, and whether to even drive at all. And EVs are not the only alternatives to driving. Mr Sharael Taha has reminded this House that hybrid vehicles are another alternative that are already widely available today.",
            "We are also keeping public transport affordable and accessible through rail and bus subsidies and investing in public transport infrastructure.",
            "Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Dennis Tan asked if we are sufficiently prepared for an EV future, and on the cost-effectiveness of electric cars compared to petrol cars. The Ministry of Transport will elaborate on this at the Committee of Supply.",
            "There will never be a good time to raise petrol duty. Some Members like Ms Mariam Jaafar and Mr Darryl David have pointed out that the petrol-duty increase would affect those who drive for work more, like our taxi and private hire car drivers, and delivery riders using motorcycles. I understand the pressure that they are facing, especially during this COVID-19 situation. I have cushioned the impact for these drivers and riders.",
            "We expect to channel almost all of the increase in duty collections in 2021 back to petrol-vehicle owners as offsets.",
            "On top of the road tax rebates, more support will be provided to those who drive for work through additional Petrol Duty Rebates. Taken together, the support will cover the increase in petrol duty for a year for motorcycles and taxis.",
            "Taxi operators and Grab Rentals have agreed to pass on the road tax rebates to their drivers. Gojek will also be introducing additional incentive rebates for their drivers. With this, their drivers will receive rebates starting from next month.",
            "Motorcycle owners will receive their additional Petrol Duty Rebates from May.",
            "Over 50,000 of our taxi and private hire car drivers would have also benefited from COVID-19 relief measures, like the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, and the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund, which we have just topped up by $133 million.",
            "I hope these measures address Members like Mr Chong Kee Hiong, Ms Yeo Wan Ling and Mr Ang Wei Neng's concerns over the impact on taxi and private hire car drivers.",
            "Our broad-based rebates will not be able to cater to every unique circumstance. They may also not reach those in more informal work arrangements. We are working with the Labour Movement to see how we can provide further help to self-employed delivery workers and limousine drivers. I thank NTUC Secretary-General Mr Ng Chee Meng, our Labour Members of Parliament and their team for their partnership.",
            "Ultimately, protecting our environment must be our commitment to future generations of Singaporeans. This is just one of the many small but necessary steps in our whole-of-society, multi-generational effort to preserve our clean-living environment.",
            "Let me now turn to Members' points on our fiscal strategy.",
            "Before I address individual issues, it is important that I reiterate this Government's fiscal principles. We abide by the same two core values of our forefathers: prudence and stewardship.",
            "First, on prudence. We spend on needs, not wants, and we seek to get the best value out of our spending. We must be prudent because these finite resources are entrusted to us by Singaporeans.",
            "Second, on stewardship. In the Unity Budget Round-Up in 2020, I said and I quote, \"We have a duty not just to those who make their views known today, but also to the young and the future Singaporeans. They are not here today to represent their views – because they are not born yet! But we have a responsibility to them, and we have to take decisions which are difficult for us, but which will safeguard their interests.\"",
            "In other words, we must be responsible stewards.",
            "During a time of high economic growth in the 1980s, our leaders managed our fiscal surpluses prudently. Instead of finding ways to spend the surpluses and win popularity, they not only accumulated surpluses, but also took the bold step in 1991 to amend the Constitution, to require each term of Government to run a balanced budget.",
            "This is to ensure that future Governments do not make unrealistic promises, dip into our savings unnecessarily, and mortgage the future of our children. They knew the temptation of squandering the easy inheritance would be too great for some to bear.",
            "Singapore is in a new phase of development. We cannot expect the same kind of buoyant GDP growth as in the past, as our economy now matures. Our expenditure needs will grow as new needs arise, and as our population ages. At the same time, we must continue to invest to build a better Singapore for the future. We are once again confronted with hard choices. We must abide by our core values, and keep Singaporeans, now and generations to be born, at the heart of what we do.",
            "Many Members spoke about building a fair and just society where no one is left behind. This is good, and I share this aspiration; but it is only one half of the conversation.",
            "Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Alex Yam, and Mr Lim Biow Chuan have reminded this House that just as importantly, we need to consider how to pay for these.",
            "We do not have oil gushing out from our ground, and even Saudi Arabia, a country with huge oil reserves, is carefully planning ahead. It introduced a 5% value-added tax from 2018, which it increased to 15% from 1 July 2020.",
            "Members of this House must have the will and courage to make the same responsible choices as our forefathers did. We must be upfront – that if we want to spend more, we have to raise the revenue.",
            "First, acknowledge that if we want more social safety nets, it comes with costs.",
            "Second, work out sustainable resourcing. Do not make irresponsible promises which burden future generations.",
            "If these are recurrent needs – which have to be financed year after year – we must find recurrent revenues – which we can collect year after year.",
            "Let me reiterate why the GST-rate increase is needed.",
            "As Mr Xie Yao Quan has rightly pointed out, we have already seen structural increases in our recurrent spending, especially in healthcare.",
            "The share of Singaporeans aged 65 and above will increase from one in six, to one in four by 2030. Seniors are four times as likely to be hospitalised compared to younger persons. And each time our seniors are hospitalised, they stay for twice as long.",
            "The Government heavily subsidises healthcare at our public healthcare institutions – up to 80%! Even with an efficient healthcare system, we will need to increase healthcare spending by 30% to meet the needs of our population in 2030.",
            "These structural trends are clear – we will have to spend more. So, let me share some data and projections with this House.",
            "This chart shows our spending, as a percentage of GDP, over the past 15 years. [",
            "Please refer to",
            "Annex 4",
            ".",
            "]",
            "Our spending has grown by about 1.5 percentage points of GDP in every five-year period. How much is 1.5 percentage points of GDP? About $7 billion per year! This is about two-thirds of the current GST revenue.",
            "Half of the increase in spending was for social support.",
            "We do not have a crystal ball but let us take a reasonable look at how our spending will change. Let us start with healthcare spending.",
            "Our demographic trends will mean higher spending, outstripping GDP growth. We estimate that healthcare spending will reach 3% of GDP by 2030. If our healthcare spending grew like those of OECD countries with a similar demographic profile, it would be even higher, 3.5% of GDP by 2030. This would be 50% more than in 2019.",
            "Stripping out the effects of COVID-19, the next chart shows projected spending on healthcare if we took the average of the two scenarios. [",
            "Please refer to",
            "Annex 5",
            ".]",
            "So, this means that healthcare spending alone would cause Government expenditure to grow by 0.5 percentage points of GDP for the current five-year period, and another 0.3 percentage points for the next five-year period. So, that is the chart that I just mentioned, over five-year periods.",
            "To see the impact of healthcare on Government spending, this chart made a simplifying assumption that non-healthcare spending will remain the same as a percentage of GDP. Now, we know this is a simplifying assumption and a very conservative one.",
            "First, on security, threats have not diminished but are now coming in different forms – cybersecurity, hybrid, information wars, food security. In Budget 2018, I mentioned that we could expect annual security spending by MINDEF and MHA to rise by 0.2 percentage points of GDP to meet rising threats.",
            "Second, other social spending will continue to rise. We are seeing higher spending on pre-school education and lifelong learning.",
            "Third, as I explained in my Budget Statements in this year and earlier, we will see a hump in infrastructural spending to enhance economic competitiveness, build our home, and improve connectivity across the island. Even with borrowing under the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, or SINGA, we expect infrastructural spending to remain relatively stable as a percentage of GDP.",
            "Mr Pritam Singh asked that we increase the scrutiny of expenditures, and to set up an independent parliamentary budget office to enhance such scrutiny. I am glad that Mr Singh agrees with the need to be prudent and accountable in our spending. In fact, it would be very helpful if each time Mr Singh or his colleagues ask the Government to spend more, to give us their estimates of how much it would cost and how they would fund it.",
            "Instead, the Workers' Party has called on the Government to spend $20 million to set up an independent parliamentary budget office to do this job for them. Even as they call for more scrutiny on Government expenditure, we invite them to hold themselves to the same scrutiny.",
            "As I have outlined, prudence and stewardship are core values of this Government. We hold ourselves to high standards and work hard to ensure that our spending is cost-effective, to deliver the best value for money for taxpayers.",
            "We have achieved world-leading outcomes while running one of the leanest governments in the world. We are always looking to achieve better outcomes with less, and we will say more about this during MOF’s COS.",
            "In addition to independent audits by the Auditor-General’s Office, we also have Parliamentary scrutiny of our spending through the Estimates and Public Accounts Committees. The Workers’ Party is represented in both of them. Such an office would be a wasteful duplication of these functions.",
            "So, let us face the hard facts and be prepared to make difficult choices. The Government is meeting difficult trade-offs arising from our society’s growing spending needs, head on.",
            "We have shown that current taxes are insufficient to cover our spending needs. Since 2007, we have already increased various taxes to collect more from those with more means, which are then transferred to our lower income. All this while, over the 14 years, the GST rate has remained unchanged at 7%. We would be in a budget deficit if not for the contribution from reserves, in the form of Net Investment Returns Contribution or NIRC.",
            "Economic growth alone is not likely to raise enough revenues to meet our needs. The honest, but hard, conclusion is that we will need to raise more tax revenue.",
            "We are not raising the GST rate now, as the economy is in the nascent stages of recovery. But we have been giving notice, since Budget 2018. The fact is that some of the structural increase in expenditures will hit us sooner rather than later.",
            "MOH is already ramping up our public healthcare capacity. Just two months ago, the Minister for Health announced that we will build a new integrated hospital in Bedok North by 2030, to serve the growing population in the east. If we defer this spending, we risk being unable to adequately care for our people when the need comes.",
            "Some may ask if the projections are accurate, whether we really need to raise additional revenue within this timeline. No projection is perfect. We live in a complex world, filled with uncertainties. So, we must work with the information available. For example, we could not have projected the biggest disruption of our generation, or that we would have to draw on our Past Reserves for two years in a row. This is a far cry from what Mr Pritam Singh said in February 2020, and I quote, \"the current Government has had the privilege of far more budgetary elbow room, both political and fiscal, than any previous Government in Singapore's history.\" Unquote. Unfortunately, instead of elbow room, COVID-19 has given governments around the world a very sharp elbow. Ouch – it hurts, and will continue to hurt for some time.",
            "I also do not know how Mr Leong Mun Wai could say with such confidence, and I quote, \"for the foreseeable future, we do not see any shortage of fiscal revenues\", unquote. If Mr Leong could give me the basis of his projection, I will study it carefully. But if it is his hunch, I hope that as a responsible Member of Parliament, he would agree that we cannot be advocating national policy on the basis of personal hunches.",
            "My caution to all is this: it will be foolhardy to underestimate the risks and uncertainties we are facing. Let us be honest, focus on the hard work that needs to be done and do not take the easy way out. That is the way to enable our people to make progress.",
            "Several Members have expressed worries about the impact of the GST rate increase on Singaporeans. I share your concern – as I said before, as Finance Minister, I do not have any joy in raising taxes. I do it because I care for our future. Let me assure Members and all Singaporeans that we are committed to helping our people manage the impact.",
            "We have set aside $6 billion for an Assurance Package, which will in effect delay at least five years of the GST rate increase for the majority of Singaporean households. Lower income Singaporeans will receive higher offsets of about 10 years’ worth of additional GST expenses incurred.",
            "The Assurance Package is on top of existing benefits and transfers such as the GST Voucher scheme. These keep our overall taxes and transfers system fair and progressive.",
            "In 2020, the top 20% of Singaporean households by income paid 56% of the taxes and received 11% of the benefits whereas the bottom 20% paid 9% of the taxes and received 27% of the benefits. And we are concerned for the broad middle income. The middle 60% of households paid 35% of taxes, while receiving 62% of the benefits, even for the broad middle.",
            "Several Members have asked that we consider other forms of taxes. As I have said at my Round-up Speech at Budget 2018, we continually consider all options, so let me go through them again but it is a long list.",
            "Some Members asked if we can do more on wealth taxes. Wealth taxes are not new in Singapore and we have in fact enhanced the progressivity of wealth-related taxes over the years.",
            "I agree there is scope to further review our wealth taxes. But first, let me address the elephant in the room. Wealth taxes will not replace the need for the GST rate increase. Already, the GST rate increase alone will not yield sufficient revenue to meet our growing healthcare and social spending needs.",
            "I will share briefly our considerations for the suggestions raised.",
            "Ms Foo Mee Har suggested a one-off wealth tax. Argentina did this to fund higher spending for COVID-19 measures. Singapore entered COVID-19 with a strong fiscal position, and is fortunate to be able to tap on our Past Reserves. The impact of the crisis has been uneven. I believe Ms Foo’s intent is for those who came out on top of the crisis to do more for our community, and I share her sentiment. We will indeed continue to review our wealth taxes.",
            "Mr Leon Perera suggested raising Buyer’s Stamp Duty and Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty, or ABSD, for more expensive properties.",
            "First, I am glad that he recognised that this move will not fully cover our higher resourcing needs. Second, I want to correct a misconception. The ABSD is a property market measure, not a revenue-raising one. We calibrate the ABSD carefully to maintain a stable and sustainable property market in Singapore. But I agree that there is a role for property-related taxes. The Government will continue to review this to ensure that it remains progressive. Indeed, we made property tax and stamp duty more progressive in Budget 2010, Budget 2013 and Budget 2018. I trust that Mr Perera will give his strong support if and when we make such new moves.",
            "We have also considered other options, including estate duty. We abolished estate duty in 2008, because the middle and upper income groups were affected disproportionately compared to the wealthy, who were better able to avoid the estate duty through tax planning.",
            "Let me reiterate. We do tax wealth and we have been raising wealth taxes over the years. This is not the question. Rather, the practical question has always been how to design wealth taxes moves to ensure that they are effective.",
            "First, we must ensure that the tax cannot be easily avoided, especially by those with more means. Otherwise, it will not achieve the social equity and fairness that we want.",
            "Second, we must balance between progressivity and staying competitive to grow our economy. Singapore must remain attractive to those who work hard and those who invest to create good jobs, because growing the economy is the most sustainable way to generate revenue and raise our standards of living.",
            "Third, the move should add to our revenue resilience and adequacy.",
            "The Government will continue to study wealth tax options and I look forward to your support.",
            "Several Members have also said that we could rely on other sources of revenue, other than taxes. For instance, Mr Louis Chua cited the Government’s total estimated receipts and claimed that the Government has far more surpluses than we do for spending. He must know that includes our capital receipts from land sales. So, he is really saying that we should spend our land sales proceeds directly. Mr Louis Chua also cited the increase in NIRC in 2021 as one of the reasons we should not be, and I quote, \"overzealous in strengthening our revenue position\"; and Mr Leong Mun Wai suggested that we spend 100% of the NIRC instead of 50%.",
            "Let me address them one by one.",
            "First on using land sales proceeds directly in the Budget.",
            "We should treat our land as a scarce and finite asset. Selling land does not give the Government more resources and should not directly support our expenditure. Instead, we sell the land that we need to sell for urban development and invest the proceeds. This approach generates a sustainable stream of income over the long term, and has served us well. If we had decided in the past to spend the proceeds from these land sales, we would not have built up our reserves today and would surely be worse off by now.",
            "Relying directly on land sales for fiscal revenue also has two risks.",
            "First, land prices can be volatile. You do not want Government revenues to fluctuate wildly with property cycles because it creates too much uncertainty for the Government to plan long term.",
            "Second, even more serious, once a Government gets used to relying on land sales to fund spending, the Government has a vested interest to keep land prices high, or to sell more land. Both options are terrible. We can see the distortionary effects on the welfare of people, in places where local governments rely on land sales for revenue.",
            "The current approach of spending the land sales proceeds through the NIRC avoids these pitfalls and allows the Government to make land sale decisions based on what is best for the country’s development, and not because it needs to balance the Budget.",
            "Next, on NIRC.",
            "The NIRC framework smooths the volatility arising from sharp fluctuations in the asset base due to market cycles. This avoids a boom-bust pattern in Government spending, driven by the volatilities of the market.",
            "However, some variation is still to be expected for the NIRC as we update the net asset base and investment income figures over the course of the year.",
            "The global financial market remains volatile and uncertain. How the post-COVID structural changes will affect long-term returns is still being played out.",
            "The fact is, NIRC is already the largest single source of our revenue, larger than Corporate Income Tax, Personal Income Tax or GST.",
            "This did not happen by chance or merely because of good fortune. It is the result of years of fiscal discipline and prudence of our founding generations. If they had succumbed to the temptation to spend more, we would not have built up our reserves. And without reserves, we would not have been able to generate this stable and recurrent source of revenue today.",
            "Mr Leong Mun Wai's suggestion of using 100% of NIRC is akin to treating our reserves as a gold mountain. If we adopt his suggestion, one day, even this mountain will be eaten up completely, like the saying in Chinese \"坐吃山空\". We have a responsibility to future generations.",
            "Next, let me talk about the use of debt in our fiscal strategy.",
            "Many Members have expressed support for borrowing for long-term infrastructure, as part of our fiscal strategy.",
            "I was happy to hear that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim was \"happy as a clam\" when he heard that our fiscal strategy reflected a number of elements that he had previously outlined. But I announced that we were studying borrowing in 2019, even before he entered Parliament. But I am glad he shares our views. So, perhaps if he reads more of our past Budget Statements, he would be even happier.",
            "Nevertheless, I must caution against the additional modifications that he has suggested to what is essentially a prudent and restrained use of borrowing.",
            "The Government's approach to borrowing is a carefully calibrated one. As Ms Foo Mee Har said, there is good debt and there is bad debt. While we do borrow, the key difference is what we do with the debt proceeds.",
            "The Government is currently already borrowing, under the Government Securities Act and the Local Treasury Bills Act. But instead of spending the proceeds, we invest them for long-term returns, which is used to repay our debt. The rest go back into the reserves.",
            "The Government is going to borrow for major, long-term infrastructure. These investments will benefit and generate value over generations, but the upfront costs are hefty. Borrowing is a fair and efficient approach to spread out the lumpy costs, to ensure that we better match the timing of the benefits with the timing of spending. If we do not, I will have to raise taxes significantly to fund these major expenditures.",
            "And Assoc Prof Jamus Lim has asked if we can borrow more to fund \"soft capital\" like education. Let me sound a word of caution. We have to refrain from the temptation to borrow for what are essentially recurrent expenditures.",
            "In many countries, there is a tendency to expand the scope of what constitutes \"soft capital\" beyond the original intentions. So, the original intentions were good but it creeps. So, when used to fund increases to Government subsidies or social transfers, it is really more recurrent spending. Borrowing continuously for them will just lead to ever higher debts which have to be repaid by future generations.",
            "When borrowing is not used productively, the result has often been high debt, low growth, rather than high growth, low debt. As debt level grows, interest payments can also increase, as Assoc Prof Jamus Lim himself pointed out. This can lead to an unsustainable fiscal position and spiralling debt, affecting investor confidence, raising the costs of funding for businesses and ultimately, our long-term growth. In addition, interest rates are low, in fact, ultra low for now, but this may change quickly. When it changes, existing debts would have to be refinanced and a higher rate could spiral the fiscal situation downward quickly. This usually happens in a crisis, when we can least afford it.",
            "Borrowing is not a form of revenue. Borrowing gives us cash for liquidity planning but it does not create free monies for spending. Today's debt is paid for by tomorrow's growth and tomorrow's generation.",
            "As I have explained earlier, our fiscal principle is that every Government must spend within its means and raise the revenue required to fund its initiatives.",
            "Members, such as Ms Foo Mee Har and Dr Lim Wee Kiak have noted, we must borrow prudently and sustainably. So, let me now also briefly address their queries on the safeguards and how borrowing under SINGA might impact our credit rating.",
            "We will set $90 billion as a borrowing limit and this is sized based on the expected expenditure of major, long-term infrastructure projects over the next 15 years. Any increase of this limit will require legislative amendments which is subjected to Parliamentary approval. We will also put in place other safeguards, such as a limit on the interest costs, so that the debt servicing cost will not over-burden future generations. This will address Ms Foo's concern about rising interest rates. More will be elaborated later when the Bill is presented in Parliament later this year.",
            "Since the announcement of SINGA, credit rating agencies have also published articles affirming Singapore's strong credit standing, attributing it to Singapore's prudent and sustainable fiscal policy.",
            "Mr Liang Eng Hwa also asked if we would consider one-off, special purpose borrowing for the economic investments under our emerging stronger strategies to help Singapore to emerge stronger. I thank Mr Liang for his suggestion.",
            "As I have explained earlier, borrowing does not give us revenue. Instead, if the economic and fiscal outlook turn out worse than expected and we have to draw on Past Reserves for economic investments, borrowing would allow us to keep our reserves invested long term and earn good returns. Borrowing from the market also means that we will have to have the discipline to repay amounts used for these economic investments.",
            "The key here is to use debt equitably and sustainably. We will borrow under the SINGA to spread out lumpy costs equitably across current and future generations. The Government will study Mr Liang's suggestion of a one-off, special purpose borrowing to help us emerge stronger from this long drawn out crisis.",
            "Staying true to our core values of prudence and stewardship, we have built up significant reserves that are now our strategic assets.",
            "Our reserves give us the confidence to forge forward, knowing that we have the wherewithal to deal with any crisis that might come our way. We have drawn on our past reserves to deal with two crises so far – $4 billion in 2009 to deal with the Global Financial Crisis; and up to $53.7 billion in 2020 and 2021 to respond decisively to the COVID-19 crisis.",
            "Some commentators have questioned if we are dipping into the Past Reserves too readily. And yet, there are others who downplay the use of reserves, saying that these are small amounts and we can afford to use more of our reserves by spending more through the NIRC.",
            "Let me reiterate that the Government does not take any decision on the use of reserves lightly. Our reserves serve three important roles.",
            "First, they serve as an endowment fund, providing a key stream of revenue to supplement our annual Budget through the NIRC. Second, they provide a buffer against shocks and attacks on our financial system. Third, they serve as our bulwark against crises of an extraordinary nature.",
            "Due to the strategic importance of our reserves, we have a two-key approach to managing and safeguarding reserves. The Elected President serves as the custodian of our reserves. The Constitution vests in the President discretionary powers to withhold her assent to budgets and expenditures proposed by the Government that may lead to a draw on Past Reserves.",
            "On this note, I would like to address a question repeated by Ms Hazel Poa on whether the President knows the size of the reserves. I have just addressed this in June last year when I rounded up the debate for the Fortitude Budget. I shall repeat my answer here.",
            "It is public information that, under our Constitution, the President has access to information about the size of reserves. Under Article 22F of the Constitution, in the exercise of her functions under the Constitution, the President is entitled to any information regarding the reserves. In addition, on the MOF website, it is already mentioned that the President has full information about the size of the reserves.",
            "Ms Hazel Poa also asked about the size of our reserves. Again, it is not in our national interest to disclose the size of the reserves. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat explained very well yesterday, Singapore is vulnerable to currency speculation and large capital outflows. Revealing the size of the reserves is akin to laying bare our defence plan and will diminish the value of our reserves as a strategic defence. No responsible leader would do so.",
            "So, I was very alarmed when I heard Assoc Prof Jamus Lim citing theoretical literature that speculation could be stabilising. I would also point out that there are other academics who recognise that currency markets can be marked by massive instability.",
            "It is, in fact, well acknowledged by most economists today that market-driven short-term flows are and will continue to be fickle and extremely volatile. The episode in 1992 when hedge fund manager George Soros took on the Bank of England by betting against the Sterling pound and dramatically destroyed the UK monetary system is one stark example. To put it simply, foreign exchange speculations have been and will continue to be a threat to economies, especially small, open ones like ours.",
            "As an international financial centre, portfolio and banking-related flows in Singapore amounted to S$294 billion last year, or 63% of our GDP. Just last year, we saw extreme capital flow volatility in global financial markets due to the uncertainties and risk sentiments associated with the pandemic. MAS kept the Singapore dollar nominal exchange rate stable during this period backed by the full power of our reserves, giving banks and businesses certainty to make decisions under very trying circumstances.",
            "I personally saw this during the Asian Financial Crisis, when I was Principal Private Secretary (PPS) to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee was invited by several countries in the region to share his views, as Singapore was relatively unscathed. I sat in all his meetings. It was very painful to see how speculation and the currency volatilities that these countries face was destroying businesses, big and small, and the lives of men and women in these places. The exchange rate is far more important for a small open economy like ours compared to our neighbouring countries. And if our neighbouring countries are so badly affected during the Asian Financial Crisis, you can imagine the impact on us.",
            "The Singapore dollar is one of the most actively traded currencies in the world relative to our GDP with daily turnover estimated at US$37 billion globally or annual turnover of US$9.5 trillion. Our nominal GDP is just US$350 billion. So, you are comparing trillions and billions.",
            "Let me share that I was Managing Director of MAS when the Global Financial Crisis hit the world. Singapore is unique in operating in an exchange-rate centred monetary policy. My team and I had to not just be alert to the domino effect of the failures of banks globally, but also the flights of capital and the risks of speculation on the Singapore dollar. If we had been attacked, the businesses in Singapore, big or small, and the lives of our workers, would have been severely disrupted.",
            "Now, as a Board member of MAS, I want to ensure that MAS is able to continue effectively using Singapore's exchange rate to deliver price stability. A very volatile Singapore dollar exchange rate, subject to market fads and bubbles, would not ensure low and stable prices for Singaporeans.",
            "In normal times, our nation’s reserves also underpin our triple A sovereign credit rating, thus underpinning confidence in our unique exchange rate monetary policy system.",
            "So, as a practitioner at the frontline, who tries my best to understand the intricacies of the system, I must caution Assoc Prof Jamus Lim – let us not play with fire. This is about the lives of our people, not theoretical musings.",
            "And I urge all Members of this House to focus the debate on the merits of the policies and programmes and how we can improve the lives of Singaporeans. Instead of repeatedly focusing their attention on the size of reserves or other erroneous claims. We have inherited a strategic asset for the long-term survival and success of Singapore. Protect it, nurture it and never squander it.",
            "Let me now turn to the global outlook, and our next steps.",
            "I said in my Budget Statement that we expect to fund the expenditure for the remainder of this term of Government without a further draw on Past Reserves. But the global outlook is highly uncertain, and we need to think ahead of how we can respond.",
            "Prof Hoon Hian Teck articulated well the difficult balance Singapore needs to strike: stabilising the economy to avoid a sharp downturn, but also undertaking and investing in structural policies for transformation.",
            "The uncertainty over how quickly the global economy will recover makes this balancing act even more complicated. If we face a prolonged slump, it will be even more necessary for us to transform, but it will also be more challenging to find the required fiscal resources to both stabilise and restructure the economy.",
            "Taking the longer-term view, we have to press on with these economic investments, secure the next decade of growth and emerge stronger. If we hold back these investments, we will miss the opportunity to restructure, seize new opportunities and race ahead. If we fail to change and our economic recovery is sluggish, it would have a long tail effect on our jobs and economic vibrancy, and affect Singaporeans adversely. It will also further worsen our fiscal situation.",
            "So, after considering the various options, if the public health and economic situation deteriorate sharply and our fiscal situation turns out to be worse than expected, the Government may again have to seek the President’s approval for the use of Past Reserves to continue such economic investments so that Singaporeans can emerge stronger.",
            "The President has expressed her understanding towards the Government’s approach and will consider the Government’s specific proposals, should there be a need to draw on Past Reserves.",
            "But if we are to draw on Past Reserves for the economic investments to emerge stronger, we should do our best to make good on the draw. These investments are expected to yield returns for the economy, which can give a boost to our tight fiscal situation and allow us to make good the amount drawn.",
            "As a crisis response to COVID-19, we have drawn from the Past Reserves, an amount equivalent to about 20 years of financial surpluses. It will be a challenge to also make good this amount drawn given the magnitude of the crisis. This is the \"crisis fund\" function of the reserves. Nonetheless, we should strive to remain fiscally prudent to build back our reserves gradually.",
            "The fiscal situation ahead will be very challenging but I believe that Members agree on several issues. There is scope to do more to take better care of Singaporeans, especially the more vulnerable. With that, we will need to find the resources to do so. We need to consider all available options to raise revenues. We will continue to review additional options to complement a GST rate increase, but it is not realistic to hope for these to become alternatives to a GST rate increase, or to make the GST rate increase unnecessary.",
            "Each of the decisions we make or do not make today to tackle the challenges will determine the starting point we give our future generations. We must have the courage to confront the hard issues now and not take the easy way out. We are stewards and must keep faith with our future generations. Doing so will give us the resources to deliver on social, economic and security priorities to further the welfare of Singaporeans. Not just today, but also tomorrow.",
            "Mr Speaker, Sir, we inherited a strong Singapore. We are able to enjoy many opportunities and work towards our aspirations, because our pioneers were also good stewards with courage. They steered Singapore through many storms.",
            "We have strong governance and trusted institutions today. We have built a strong global Singapore brand. We contribute to the world in our own way.",
            "COVID-19 has taught the world that trust is a valuable currency, and there is a high premium for long-term planning, and reliability. Singapore takes pride into doing these well. First, we plan long term and act in the best interest of Singapore and our people. Mr Cheng Hsing Yao rightly pointed out that we now have the luxury of choices in dealing with resource constraints, precisely because of the foresight of the generations before us. Second, we are upfront. We do not shy away from difficult conversations. We explain the difficult decisions, as the well-being of Singaporeans are at the heart of what we do. Third, we honour our commitments and hold ourselves to high standards. Where we fall short, we learn and strive to do better.",
            "Singaporeans know that they can trust us to lead the country. We trust one another and advance as Singapore Together, as one united people. And this is crucial to our success, because Singapore is a small island nation in a big turbulent world. We will continue to work hard to deliver results to Singaporeans, and strengthen and grow our valuable reserve of trust and unity.",
            "Mr Speaker, allow me to say a few words in Mandarin before I conclude.",
            "Although COVID-19 is still spreading globally, we have made progress in safeguarding our health, livelihoods and businesses. This year's Budget prepares us for a post-COVID-19 world and is more targeted at helping businesses, workers and the vulnerable groups.",
            "The vaccine has brought hope for countries around the world in triumphing over the pandemic . But the tremendous impact of the pandemic has also accelerated the structural changes which were already taking place. We need to redouble our efforts to protect our future.",
            "We will continue to help businesses in all sectors to transform and to create more good jobs for our workers to ensure that Singapore thrives in the post-COVID-19 era.",
            "COVID-19 is a grave test for many countries. We will also build trust and strengthen cooperation with other countries to overcome our common challenges.",
            "Our Past Reserves give us the confidence to move forward because we have enough resources to cope with a possible crisis. Drawing on Past Reserves is a difficult decision. When considering whether or not to draw on the Past Reserves, the Government has always adhered to the principle of fiscal prudence and long-term planning, as practiced by our forefathers. This is to ensure the sustainability of our fiscal policy, that we act as stewards to safeguard the interests of future generations.",
            "Today happens to be 元宵节 or the Lantern Festival. The significance of the Lantern Festival lies in family reunion. Family union is happiness. When all of us are united as a nation , we have strength. Over the past one year, Singaporeans have shown a spirit of solidarity and fortitude. In the new year, I hope that Singaporeans will uphold this spirit and work together to build a prosperous home with strong social cohesion. The future will change rapidly but I firmly believe that as long as we work together, we will be able to overcome the challenges ahead and emerge stronger.",
            "COVID-19 has tested the strength, unity and resolve of countries – socially, economically, and fiscally. Singapore has done relatively well so far. Our society came together as One Team Singapore to battle this invisible but deadly enemy. We looked out for one another, and we stood united. We protected the livelihoods of Singaporeans amidst the immediate economic fallout. Now, our economy is gradually, but steadily, recovering.",
            "We have been careful and prudent in the use of our reserves to protect the lives and livelihoods of our people. There remain huge uncertainties ahead. But we confront these unknowns together with confidence, knowing that we have built a deep reservoir of trust to meet the challenges head on.",
            "The years ahead will be crucial. We have a narrow window of opportunity to transform our economy and forge ahead as One Team Singapore.",
            "Singapore did not happen by chance. Whether we continue to do well cannot be left to chance. I have laid out our strategy to emerge stronger. The Government is committed to put in the investments. But the Government cannot do this alone.",
            "To succeed, every Singaporean must come together to build the Singapore that we want. Businesses should continually innovate and support their workers through opportunities for training, growth and progression. Workers should seize the opportunities to up-skill and re-skill. And within our communities, I urge all Singaporeans to lend a hand to those who need more help.",
            "Nation building is hard work. But if we put our hearts, minds, hands together, I am confident that Singapore will continue to prosper and be a place we are proud to call home. That is why I have given the name \"Emerging Stronger Together\" to this year’s Budget Statement. It is as much about \"Stronger Together\" as it is about \"Emerging Stronger\".",
            "We are in this together. We all need to each play our part. We have a clear view of where we are headed. Government, businesses, and the community must come together to overcome our shared challenges; and Singaporeans must care and look out for one another along the way; so that Singapore will emerge stronger together."

I believe the MOF officials have asked Member of Parliament Assoc Prof Jamus Lim to deliver points for and it should not really be part of this debate. But having said that, that was with regard to, I believe, a fiscal office and the cut has not been delivered.",
            "Let me carry on with my clarification questions, Sir. The Parliament Budget Office or the Parliamentary Budget Office is not an unusual institution in many parliamentary democracies. It is a fairly new institution and, really, it is not to help the Opposition in Parliament. It is to help all Members of Parliament. This is constant with the separation of power schema.",
            "I was a Member of the Estimates Committee some years ago, and I will never forget – and those Members of Parliament who were Members of the Estimates Committee will also remember – a senior civil servant said, \"I cannot be smarter than my boss\". Who is her boss? Her boss is the Minister for Finance.",
            "And so, a Parliament Budget Office or officer is there to provide independent analysis to confirm the nature of the Budget, to confirm that programmes are delivering the outcomes that are desired. As was quite eloquently put by the Member for Aljunied, Mr Leon Perera, who said it is not just about getting an \"A\" for effort, it is about scoring and \"A\" for outcomes.",
            "And to that end, as I acknowledged in my speech, and Deputy Prime Minister Heng also shared in his Round-up speech, the Budget is not about a one-year programme. It is about a multi-year programme. And in my speech, I asked Deputy Prime Minister Heng – for which I do not believe a clarification was forthcoming – about the headline $24 billion figure which is a multi-year initiative, questions about the accountability of this figure, how are we going to look back at this figure and say that money has been spent prudently?",
            "The second point is with regard to the Capability Transfer Programme. I believe I had some questions about it and fundamentally again, the Minister committed until 2024, I believe. And I had some questions about how many Singaporeans were trained? The Minister gave the number: less than 970. And my query also sought information on how much money was spent on this initiative and whether these outcomes are outcomes that the Government is satisfied with. I do not believe that was answered.",
            "My third point is a carryover from the Unity Budget. The Minister made the point about a remark I had made, elbow room, more fiscal elbow room than any other government. I think that is factually true. More revenues, certainly, more expenditure, but certainly more revenues as well for the Government to spend and to consider how to lay out its plans.

In the Unity Budget, I spoke about another community of individuals – private hire bus drivers – and many of them support the tourism sector. I think in this Budget with the JSS being extended to severely-hit sectors like aviation, I am sure the workers in that industry, the companies in that industry, appreciate the support.",

One of the most important interventions was to subsidise the cost of parking in HDB estates for these private hire bus drivers. And that was extended to March 2021. Can I ask Minister Heng whether this extension would continue for this group of workers, because the tourism industry is decimated?"

Some Members elevated the debate to help Singaporeans appreciate the changing landscape and the need to change. Some Members highlighted importance of our reserves – the bold and decisive response mounted and what it achieved. Unfortunately, some argue selectively without acknowledging the broader context, broader impact of COVID-19 and the outcomes of the Government's decisive interventions.",

            "The first is one where I raised that the Government cash surplus from 2011 to 2019, that is about $261 billion or about $29 billion of cash surplus a year. I understand that the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned that the land sales revenue would form a key part of it. Based on what I could see, that would be about a $138 billion within the same time period or about $15 billion. So, in the spirit of accountability, just so all of us can better understand, where did the balance of $14 billion of cash surplus come from?",
            "And I understand the need for us to be prudent about the use of land sales and this is something which I understand, but I think it is not one where we are calling for the use of land sales revenue in its entirety. It is one whereby, if you look at the incentives to using land sales revenue, they already exist today, but probably in a different extent. And I think it is also important, I guess, for me to share that —",
            "Sorry, so, what I mean is that the incentives for using land sales as a means to increase revenue. I think that is something that is already done indirectly and so that is already in place although to a different extent.",
            "But I think the broader point that I also would like to share, is in the context of Singapore, when it comes to land sales, it is something which I believe is a recurring source of revenue for the Government as well. That is the first clarification.",
            "The second is, there has been a lot of talk about our reserves. Just now Deputy Prime Minister mentioned that is about 20 years of surplus. Yesterday, a different Member shared that we have blown about 10 years' worth of savings. And I think earlier today, a separate Member also asked how long do we need before we can replenish our reserves.",
            "So, probably it will be helpful for Members of this House to understand, after accounting for the additional $11 billion of the draw at the end of FY2021, where would our reserves be? I mean, we do not need to know an absolute number, but where would our reserves be compared to 10 years ago, five years ago. That also helps us to understand the context, but without knowing the absolute amount of the reserves itself."

You cannot plan land sales on the basis that we need the revenue, and therefore, I would have to do that. The land sale proceeds, they go into the past reserves.",
            "I totally reject your allegation that the Government has an incentive to sell more land in order to generate revenue. If the Government had an incentive, I would not have pointed out the problems in many countries. I have studied this in many countries where unfortunately, where the government, especially the local government, is so reliant on land sales that they have a vested interest to keep land prices high because they need the revenue, and, in turn, that creates a lot of hardship for the people.",
            "So, our system cannot incentivise it. URA has long-term plans – 50-year plans, 20-year plans. The land use planning has been a great strength of Singapore. I think you should seriously look at what the agencies have been doing and do not make allegations like these.

So, that is the first point.",
            "Second, I think there is a role for building all this soft capital. If you want to talk about whether my notion of partnership, working together, is soft capital, well, you can say that and say: should we invest a lot of money in that? We have been very careful to say how we can build our society. In fact, if you want to use academic terminologies like these, there is a lot of soft capital in our neighbourhood because people are supporting one another, and we did see soft capital coming up.",

            "So, let me share my experience as Education Minister. I said in my speech, and in fact, I have shown this slide many times. Perhaps I should show it again and again until the message gets through. I have shown it many times how Singapore has been ranked so well in the international ranking of students.",
            "I have also shared that in 2018, when the IMF/World Bank meeting was held in Bali, President Jim Yong Kim of the World Bank invited the Prime Minister to talk about the Human Capital Index. And when I was walking with President Jim Yong Kim to the venue site, I asked him: \"Personally, I am not terribly comfortable talking about Singapore being ranked well because it is not our approach to talk about our ranking. So, what is your purpose?\" And he said something which has never left me. He said, \"Well, actually, my interest in Singapore is not how much you spend, but how well you spent.\"",
            "And the reason he could say that was that he had done comparisons, the World Bank team had done comparisons, of the educational expenditure and the outcomes of the student. We ranked well not because we spent the most money, but because we actually achieved outcomes.",
            "Having been Education Minister for five years and visiting so many of our schools, I am convinced that our schools and our teachers have put in the greatest amount of effort, and the fact that we have parents who are so supportive of our kids' education is what allowed our students to do so well. There is no one magic formula. You can have a number and say, \"I would like to know whether it is 5% or 10% of GDP\" and so on. It does not.",
            "I have also said in this Budget debate and even in the previous round, about our healthcare outcome. It is the same – it is not what you spend; it is how you spend it and the dedication of the staff.",
            "So, I am extremely grateful to our frontline officers, to our teachers and our educators in their various roles in our schools, and which is why, as Education Minister, I talked about every school being a good school, because I am deeply convinced that that is the case. It is not something that a Budget and a theoretical number can give you the result.",
            "So, President Jim Yong Kim told me, \"I hope that Singapore is open to sharing this so that others can learn because there are countries who will need to raise this, and they are very concerned that they will not have the resources to educate their people better\".",
            "So, it is how we use it.",
            "Now, the second question on the exchange rate. Let me again state, for the benefit of our currency stability and for the benefit of all of these debates around the world about manipulating exchange rate, Singapore does not manipulate our exchange rate. Singapore does not manipulate our exchange rate. We do not manipulate it to secure a competitive advantage because that is not sustainable.",
            "As an economics professor, I think he will fully understand that, that long-term sustainability for economic competitiveness must come from productivity growth and labour force growth. Our labour force growth is turning towards zero. And so we have to rely on productivity growth –which is why in the next phase of our transformation, we need to focus on technology and innovation-driven growth.",

As to your question about why the secrecy, I do not wish to hold up this whole forum. I devoted more than two pages of my reply to you on that, about the size of currency trading, about my experience in MAS during the Global Financial Crisis, about my experience when I was accompanying Mr Lee Kuan Yew to the countries which were so badly hit by the Asian Financial Crisis.

            "In the early years, did we borrow? Yes, we did borrow when we were building the first MRT and our airports. And, again, that was another big hump. So, the nature of infrastructure project is such that you need to build it over the next two, three years, but the benefits of that project should last us several generations.",
            "So, therefore, how do we spread out the borrowing? First, do we build or do we not build? Just because we do not have the resources to build it now, do we forego it? We must build it only if it gives you economic or social return. The projects that we did for our MRT lines, for our airport, give us both the economic and social returns, and therefore we can justify why we are doing it.",
            "But at the same time, I mentioned that, in the coming years of, first of all, even if our fiscal situation was good, it may not even be enough for us to fund that lumpy investment. So, lumpy investments need to be spread out over time.",
            "Then, the next question is how do I fund it? There are several ways. One is, could you go and use the past reserve for that? It is not because the reserves are used for extraordinary and temporary situation. It is spelt out in our Constitution.",
            "So, why are we borrowing? Well, I mentioned before that there are several reasons. One, that it is fair for inter-generational equity, because you spread out the cost of borrowing, because various generations are going to benefit from that. Second, at this point, it is efficient because interest rates are very low and ultra-low. And to your observation as to whether, therefore, we should not touch our reserves and liquidate our assets to borrow, you are a good investor."

            "At the peak of the pandemic, there was so much uncertainty and Singaporeans struggled to figure out what help schemes they are eligible for and what information to believe or not to believe. Everyone would have had a unique set of circumstances. The sheer amount of queries received were simply overwhelming.",

All officers will undergo an annual data security programme, so that they know their responsibilities and how to safeguard the data that they handle in the daily course of activities and we will also remind our officers of the severe consequences of mishandling data.",
            "I agree with Ms Hany Soh that the Government plays a critical role not only in shaping the national digital infrastructure but also the processes and the thinking and the mindset around it. Just like physical infrastructure, we must commit to ensuring that our digital infrastructure, in both the hard and software side of it, is top-notch globally. The question on 5G rollout will be handled by MCI later. But even in that area, we will make sure that we are at the leading edge of the world and, both in terms of security and efficacy, we will be there.",

I am glad to report that SingPass now provides seamless and secure access to over 1,400 digital services by 340 agencies, including private sector organisations, like some banks and insurance companies. The number of users of SingPass Mobile has grown. It was one million users in March last year. It is now 2.4 million users today. We will be looking to extend the benefits of our national digital identity platform and to enable easier access to e-services beyond our shores, and we are embarking on pilot projects with Australia and Shenzhen, China.",
            "I agree with Mr Sharael Taha that the Government's digital services must be secure, must be inclusive and must be personalised. We have introduced the SingPass two-factor authentication (2FA) modes to ensure that SingPass remains not only secure but accessible and especially to the elderly and vulnerable groups, especially those without mobile phones. And these include the latest use of Face Verification so that people can use Face Verification as a second factor and this will be based on matching their images against a verified database held by ICA. Individuals can also opt to have their SMS one-time password sent to a trusted family member so that they can still have the benefit of security and the help of a trusted family member.",

Users can also view the Government benefits and support relevant to them, such as GST Vouchers, Pioneer and Merdeka Generation MediSave top-ups and, soon, including the benefits that have been announced under this current Budget.",
            "We are also improving our digital services for improved productivity and, next quarter, GoBusiness will launch an e-Service Navigator to provide our businesses easy access to over 300 Government e-services. But more importantly, this is also an opportunity to re-engineer our processes and make Government services more suitable and facilitatory to all our businesses.",

No doubt accelerated by COVID-19 and the aversion to handling cash.",
            "Another example is the Singapore Financial Data Exchange which has enabled us, as individuals, to retrieve a consolidated view of all our personal finances, using either the MyMoneySense portal or a mobile banking app. Actually, if you have not checked this out, it is a big deal because it allows data sharing which has historically been very difficult to achieve because you get a direct overview of all your financial statements and bank accounts. But you can imagine the security needed to enable that to happen. And this was enabled because we have central digital infrastructure riding on SingPass and MyInfo and the relationship the Government has had with the banks and our role as a neutral, trusted party to enable this kind of sharing and this kind of utility to occur.",
            "I want to also thank the 150 Smart Nation Ambassadors who, even in the midst of the difficulties last year, volunteered to help promote the use of digital technologies, including TraceTogether.

            "But we do still receive requests and feedback to ensure that e-payment does not become the only mode of payment, Because there are segments amongst our residents and even small businesses that prefer to continue to use physical cash. A case in point is that, during COVID, the bank branch in our constituency was closed. You would not believe the number of emails and requests I had to talk to the bank just to get the bank to open and there were long queues. I was sent photographs of long queues at other bank branches near our constituency that residents needed to go to. So, clearly, there is anxiety and people like to still handle cash and there is also anxiety about security. This has been conveyed. So, I would like MAS to give us an update on whether Singapore residents have been more receptive to e-payments in the past year, albeit that COVID-19 would have driven some of that.

While such projects, like Seniors Go Digital and Hawkers Go Digital, are highly commendable, there must be the awareness of the gap between the availability of technology and the people using it. Contactless payments through credit and debit cards have recently become the norm in Singapore, at retail merchant outlets and even in buses and trains since 2019.",
            "Until recently, NETS relies on a PIN for verification since its inception in 1985. Recently, though, NETS has pushed out their new contactless card with similar operating principles for contactless cards as international scheme debit cards. This has led to some worries among the elderly. While contactless payment has made payments easy, senior citizens are more vulnerable to scams. The spike in bank account debit and credit-card scams in recent years has also made the elderly concerned over losing their hard-earned money in these scams. One of my elderly residents was told by DBS that all new cards will be contactless and they will not allow any card requiring PIN for all transactions. He contrasted DBS' services with OCBC's which, he said, provided a debit card which is digitally rendered non-operative by default unless so activated by the customer.",
            "Mr Chairperson. I understand that Singapore uses a chip and signature system in verifying payments through debit and credit payments. Many European countries, on the other hand, have implemented a chip-and-PIN authentication system. Such a system may be a good guard against attempts at fraudulent payment scams targeted at debit and credit cards. Indeed, we have seen an increase of such cases in the recent one to two years, and many against our senior citizens.",
            "I would like to urge MAS to explore having a chip-and-PIN debit card or a PIN-only NETS-enabled ATM bank card only meant for domestic payments that are issued to senior citizens. Such cards can provide an added layer of defence to senior citizens against any fraud or scams.",

As the money scammed are usually transferred from bank accounts, what role should banks play in trying to minimise the risks for vulnerable customers? It does seem that different banks may have varying requirements when it comes to transactional security. Therefore, I welcome the recent consultation paper by the MAS on a proposed notice on identity verification.

He noted that some financial institutions were using AI and psychometrics to help predict which customers might be more susceptible to scam attacks. This would assist in developing bespoke advisories and training programmes to help inoculate such customers from falling prey to scams. To what extent is the MAS working with banks on this?",
            "Finally, I would like to make an observation regarding the freezing of scammed monies in bank accounts in Singapore. In response to my Parliamentary Question in January 2021, the Minister for Home Affairs said that where the suspect was not arrested, a Court order was needed to return the money to victims, which process might take at least a year.

On the part of the banks, there should have been more robust credit risk assessment of the companies.

This has resulted in inconsistencies in reporting methods, quality in data disclosure and, hence, rendering the reports ineffective due to lack of comparability amongst the listed companies. It could also lead to greenwashing. According to an NUS study done in 2019 on sustainability reporting, there are clear differences in the sustainability reporting performance among different industries.",

One is e-payments and, two, is promoting greater social good, such as sustainable development.",
            "First, it is absolutely important for us to preserve and enhance the trust in our financial system. Ms Sylvia Lim asked if banks can work with the Police for more expeditious return of monies belonging to victims of scams. This is, indeed, a concern, especially when scam cases are on an uptrend. The banks have various measures to protect consumers. There are various caps, daily transaction limits, ATM withdrawal limits, contactless payment limits.",
            "Ms Sylvia Lim asked whether there could be a cooling-off period, but it is really not so practical. The cooling-off period applies more in circumstances where you buy something and you find that it was an impulsive buy, you return it and you get your refund. But for day-to-day transactions, I think there are serious practical limits to impose a cooling-off limit. But I think the most important safeguard is to practise good cyber hygiene and take personal precautions.",
            "So, for consumers, this means updating security patches and anti-virus software on your electronic devices promptly; and never giving away online banking login credentials, whether it is your user IDs, OTPs and PINs, to anyone. This includes not responding to seemingly legitimate requests for your personal and banking information, whether via email or SMS. No matter how genuine they look, never give that away.",
            "The Anti-Scam Taskforce under the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) has a specific workstream focusing on educating the public against scams. The Anti-Scam Centre under the Police, works closely with banks to freeze the bank accounts of recipients of scam monies to enable police investigations. However, once prosecution commences, it will be the Courts that decide when the seized monies can be returned, depending on factors, such as whether seized monies remain relevant for the purposes of investigation or trial. MAS understands and shares Ms Lim’s concern, and this is something we will have to consult the Police to see what is possible.",
            "Mr Murali Pillai asked about fraud prevention and anti-money laundering efforts in the commodities trading sector.

It covers the trading companies’ corporate governance, risk management and disclosure practices. Banks will use it to set standards for lending and this will be fully implemented by July this year.",

            "Mr Derrick Goh asked about surrendering of insurance plans and secondary trading of insurance policies. In 2020, despite the economic recession, the number of policies surrendered hit a five-year low of 153,000, representing 0.9% of total in-force policies. This is partly due to the industry’s COVID-19 relief measures, which allow customers to defer paying for premium up to six months. The applications for premium deferment have since fallen sharply by 80% between Q2 and Q4 of 2020.",
            "We should note not all policies surrendered are due to financial hardship. Some policyholders choose to terminate their policies because they no longer serve their needs. Whatever the case may be, it will benefit policyholders to be able to sell the policy in secondary market, which typically fetches a higher value.",
            "Let me now talk about a couple of key developments in the financial sector, starting with e-payments. Ms Jessica Tan has asked for an update and expressed some concerns.",
            "So, let me state at the outset we cannot be dogmatic about this. We are promoting e-payments because it is efficient, convenient and green, but we are not aiming to be a cashless society. Cash will continue to be a familiar and convenient way to transact, as Ms Jessica Tan has experienced. The adoption of e-payments by Singaporeans has been steadily increasing in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of e-commerce have accelerated this trend.",
            "Registrations for PayNow, for example, rose by 1.6 million last year, bringing the total number of registrations to 4.9 million. Registrations for PayNow Corporate doubled last year to around 240,000 business users. This means that 80% of residents and businesses are now on PayNow. This has driven PayNow transaction volumes to over $5 billion for the month of December 2020, which is double the volume a year ago. We expect this growth to continue, as users can now also send and receive PayNow transfers via non-bank e-wallets, such as GrabPay and Singtel Dash.",
            "Adoption of QR payments by merchants has also surged. There are 200,000 SGQR labels islandwide, with 120,000 deployed in 2020 alone. And as more people switch from cash to e-payments for their day-to-day transactions, the usage of cheques has fallen. The ratio of cheque volumes relative to e-payment volumes has dropped from 32% in 2016 to 18% in 2019 and then 12% last year. The absolute number of cheques used fell by a record 10 million in 2020.",
            "Similarly, the ratio of ATM cash withdrawals to e-payments has also been falling, from 47% in 2016 to 24% in 2019, to then 17% last year. These ratios should decline further as more people get used to accepting e-payments. And there are Singaporeans who are less familiar or face difficulties with e-payments and we will not leave them behind.",
            "The “Seniors Go Digital” initiative – Members are familiar – helps seniors acquire skills to transact digitally. Seniors can receive personal lessons at SG Digital Offices around the island and they will be handheld, people will guide them, and I believe MOE is still pressing ahead to equip every child with a bank account and digitally-enabled bank account.",
            "Furthermore, it is important that cash continue to be widely accepted in Singapore. There will continue to be ATMs and cash withdrawal points across our island. Today, there are 4,100 of these touchpoints, compared to about 3,700 five years ago.",
            "As for PIN-only bank cards requested by Mr Dennis Tan, the local banks do offer customers the ability to disable the contactless feature of their ATM and debit cards, or the option of ATM cards without the contactless feature at all. We are not aware of any bank's initiative to do away with PIN numbers. We will remind the banks to explain this option to customers who may need it.",
            "Another significant development in the financial services sector is the evolution of its role in promoting the larger social good. In this regard, Mr Desmond Choo and Mr Leon Perera asked about disclosures and sustainability reporting.",
            "We share the Members’ desire to see companies providing high-quality reports on their efforts to promote sustainability and in social contribution. We also want to see continued improvements in how our companies disclose their broader social and environmental impact, on top of their financial performance. Such disclosures are important, especially given the heightened social and environmental consciousness amongst investors. It will facilitate capital flows towards investments more aligned to the investors’ preferences, objectives and standards.",
            "Since 2016, Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) has required SGX-listed companies to disclose material environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities that could influence the decisions of investors. These include information, such as greenhouse gas emissions, skills and gender diversity of senior management and their board members. In addition, the Code of Corporate Governance requires listed companies to disclose their board diversity policies, one aspect of which is gender diversity, and the progress in implementing the policies.",
            "For financial institutions, MAS has set out its expectations with respect to the governance, management and disclosure of environmental risks. These disclosures are in accordance with international reporting frameworks, such as recommendations by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).",
            "Notwithstanding that, in certain areas – and as pointed out by Mr Leon Perera – such as in the area of environmental sustainability, current corporate disclosures are still not where they need to be, because international standards are still evolving. The basic problem is that there are various sustainability disclosure standards globally. So, this reduces the reliability, consistency and comparability of ESG disclosures across jurisdictions and even sectors. That undermines the purpose of the disclosures, which is to facilitate capital allocation decisions across competing investments.",
            "MAS and SGX RegCo are, therefore, carefully studying international initiatives on harmonising sustainability disclosure standards. One major initiative happening is that significant international standard setters are now coming together to develop unified global standards and we will monitor the developments closely.",
            "SGX RegCo will be consulting this year on enhancements to its sustainability reporting requirements. It will incorporate recommendations from the TCFD. In the meantime, MAS and SGX RegCo will continue to work with the Singapore Institute of Directors to help boards raise their sustainability reporting standards.",
            "Mr Chairman, to conclude, let me say this. As an international financial services centre, Singapore can contribute to the global climate change movement by mobilising capital towards low greenhouse gas emission solutions and climate-resilient development. These can be investments in renewable energy generation, battery technology, carbon-efficient and food production methods, so on and so forth. The ability to achieve this and not disclosures alone, is what will move the needle and make a significant impact that is beyond Singapore.",
            "Some observers have noted that in the recently announced Green Plan, not all the initiatives and targets are new. It is a fair and accurate observation and, in fact, it is only right that the Green Plan comprises existing as well as new initiatives. Because, as a nation, we have been implementing strategies to preserve our environment and combat climate change for many years. What the Green Plan does is to try to consolidate and synergise all that we are doing, all that we are planning to do, and elevate their importance.",
            "Each initiative under the Green Plan is a major multi-year undertaking. For MAS, our strategy is to develop Singapore into a leading centre for Green Finance and that was announced in November 2019. If we can successfully mobilise capital and new investment into the green economy, we can bring about a virtuous cycle of economic growth, creation of jobs and opportunities that are environmentally sustainable. In the coming years, we will need to work very hard with the industry and all our partners, to build environmental risk resilience into the financial system, of which, quality disclosures play an important part; expand green finance solutions and markets; and leverage innovation and technology.

            "In the Parenthood survey that I mentioned in my Budget debate speech, there was question: \"What would encourage you to have more children?\" Some answered “Nothing”, “I want my life back”, “Enough”, \"My parents are getting too old to help.\"",
            "Others said, \"Trusted care-givers such as grandparents\", \"infant care near home and work\", \"I must have time for each child.\"",
            "But it would seem the Government have a tough job encouraging some couples to have more children.",
            "Given the on-going COVID-19 situation, Singapore’s TFR may dip in the near term. As young couples may choose to defer their marriages due to safe distancing capacity limits imposed on weddings. Uncertain economic conditions may also cause couples to postpone their child-bearing plans. Overall, this would impact our immediate marriages and fertility outcomes. Hence, I would like ask the Minister for an update on the impact of COVID-19 on our marriage and TFR numbers.",
            "I would also like to ask the Minister on whether the Government plans to review its existing strategies to encourage more Singaporeans to marry and have children, especially given changing life priorities and societal values.",

Since 2006, South Korea was reported to have spent almost US$250 billion on mostly cash schemes such as medical subsidies for pregnant ladies, cash for each baby born and for raising the child till he was one, and monthly allowance for families with children under seven. However, South Korea still has a very lacklustre track record in terms of TFR, mainly due to the lack of desire to marry amongst the young people and also, their decision for alternate lifestyle choices.",

            "Second, also to encourage parenthood for those who are married, consider the following measures. For couples are willing and able to conceive, introduce even more generous housing priority benefits. Consider second timers, for example, for HDB flat priorities and also assure couples and all of this Interim Rental Flat that they will need before they get their flat. Consider providing free universal infant care and child care up to the age of seven.",
            "And next, for couples who are willing and unable or find difficulty in conceiving: one, provide a greater range of support measures of fertility care and education; two, study carefully and consider addition of new fertility techniques such as egg freezing into the slew of assisted reproduction measures.",
            "And for couples who are able to conceive but are reluctant or unwilling, provide respective and effective platforms for more inside-out education and sharing – dare I say, counselling – services for them to consider parenthood. And next, on the immigration policy of Singapore, through better supporting transnational families with one Singapore Citizen parent. Sir, I am deeply empathetic to residents of mine who are affected by the very strict and I know well-intended immigration decisions of our Government.",

He tried very hard to catch up with his English proficiency and worked very hard in school and later went to ITE. He was a diligent community volunteer. I helped support part of his ITE education but alas, when he reached 21 years of age, he had to leave Singapore. His mother, brother and stepfather are all Singaporeans. They are separated.",

            "Number one, unequal care load between the men and women. Singaporean women struggle to juggle work and care in a large part due to the lack of men's involvement in parenting. Utilisation of paternity leave is at 53%. And fathers that I have spoken to express a spectrum of challenges, ranging from, \"I don’t feel that I add much value at home because the baby only wants mommy\" or \"If I take leave, I will have a pile-up of work. It is even more stressful\" or \"I still need to bring the bread home.\"",
            "This is consistent with studies that NPTD has done, which brings us to major factor two – high work stress, no time and energy due to demands at work, make couples decide on having less children than what they would like to.",
            "And such resistance to taking paternity leave, made worse by workplace demands makes it necessary for stronger Government measures. My proposal is to mandate the 50-50 sharing of the current childbirth leave.",
            "Currently, mothers receive four months of maternity leave, two months of which are subsidised by the Government. And this has the unintended impact of discriminatory hiring by companies who hesitate to hire women especially those who are newly married, for fear of having to bear the financial and operational costs of paid maternity leave for four months.",
            "To ensure higher usage of paternity leave, the Government can mandate that the four months be split half and half between mom and dad, with each of the employers getting subsidised for one month by the Government. This will have an equalising effect on hiring and firms will find it easier to manage the absence of a staff for two months instead of four.",
            "Mandating paternity leave by law, and making the one month of Government subsidy only available to both firms respectively if fathers fully utilise their paternity leave, will also compel companies to be supportive of their employees taking leave in the months post-birth.",
            "To sweeten the deal for fathers, I would like to venture that the Government may want to also offer fathers income tax reliefs which are currently given to mothers, if paternity leave is fully utilised. Of course, we need to provide infant care courses for dads as it will be helpful to help fathers step up better and also set mothers' minds at ease.",
            "With such measures, we can create in time a norm in societal expectation for fathers to be present and involved in the first months of an infant's life, and subsequently as the child grows. Studies have shown that fathers who have a close relationship with their children contribute to their sons growing up with an increased inclination to be involved dads themselves.",
            "If we want to cultivate a more positive mindset towards marriage and parenthood in our future generations, we need to ensure equal sharing of the load of care. And the time is now for us to set a new norm.",

            "In 2018, two Chinese Nationals, both of whom were forklift drivers were charged for collecting multiple bribes of $1 in exchange for not delaying the loading and unloading of vehicles. Both drivers were fined and jailed between two to four months.",
            "An equally significant case came to light this year when a brother and sister were handed jail terms close to the maximum five years for conspiring to secure tenders for two companies in China and receiving in excess of $2 million in bribes. The case was significant because a substantive part of the offence was committed outside Singapore. But because the Prevention of Corruption Act applies and has extraterritorial effect, the message was a clear one. Corruption committed by Singaporeans and Singapore corporate entities are not condoned anywhere in the world.",
            "Yet, the remark of graft remaining prevalent in our paper of record, no less, is a matter of concern. While the Government is busy determining how best to reset the economy and put Singapore ahead of the pack when the post COVID-19 recovery begins, the core Singaporean value of a no-nonsense attitude towards corruption needs to be restated more forcefully. At stake is the reputation of the Singapore brand in a world where competition is stiffening and strong sustained growth harder to come by for a mature economy like ours. The goodwill and confidence generated for high quality investments by a strong emphasis against corruption through the Singapore brand cannot be understated.",
            "CPIB be cannot afford for Singaporeans to be heedless of the corruption that exists in the country and double down on public education of its work. In the Minister for Law's Parliamentary speech last November, the Minister spoke of the zeitgeist that is being felt worldwide with many societies grappling with debates about inequality and the sense that the elites are bending the rules and systems to their own advantage and that the structures are unfair.",

            "I understand that investigations can take some time to complete but in view of the profile of the latter two cases in particular which involve people have some status, there is a real public interest as to why these matters have not closed yet. In the public mind, the inordinate delay in investigations is commonly juxtaposed against the publication of names, images and details of individuals splashed prominently in our papers, involving relatively petty amounts that constitute corruption like the $1 bribe, and rightly so.",
            "To address public talk of inequality and double standards or perceptions of the same, it would be important for the CPIB and investigatory authorities to consider interim updates in view of the length of time that has elapsed since the news of the investigations broke. In the Keppel case, many remain perplexed why the authorities are taking so long to complete investigations, especially in light of Keppel officials who have been anonymously fingered in publicly available US Department of Justice documents.",
            "In November 2019, Keppel Offshore and Marine's lawyer who admitted to drafting contracts to make bribe payments was sentenced to a year's probation and fined $75,000 in the US. Although a US citizen, the district judge allowed the lawyer in question to serve his probation in Singapore where he resides with his wife. What is holding up the investigations into the Keppel matter? Because it does not seem fathomable that the company can admit to offences but at the same time, there is insufficient evidence to lay at the feet of senior Keppel officials thus far.",

Almost 10,000 families have benefited. We hope this gives some reassurance to couples to proceed with their parenthood plans.",

Meanwhile, we urge employers to continue to offer FWAs to achieve better work-life harmony while at the same time, meeting business needs.",

We are in a similar predicament as East Asian societies like South Korea and Taiwan, and Scandinavian countries known for achieving good fertility outcomes, like Finland and Norway. They also experienced a drop in TFR, and some are at historic lows too. Raising fertility is an uphill task for advanced societies, but we must continue to support those who wish to marry and have children.",

In the last five years, or 2016-2020, the average number of citizen births also increased compared to the previous five-year period of 2011-2015. We hope that notwithstanding the pandemic, Singaporeans will continue to pursue their family goals, and we will galvanise a whole-of-nation effort to support them.",

Those buying resale flats, can now receive up to $160,000 in housing grants, up from $90,000 five years ago.",

With means-tested pre-school subsidies, low- and middle-income households will pay even less.",

            "With MediSave and existing co-funding support, eight in 10 eligible Singaporean couples have no out-of-pocket expenses for their first cycle, while nine in 10 would not pay more than $500 for their first cycle.",
            "Just last year, we removed the age limit for women undergoing Assisted Reproduction Technology, or ART, treatments. We also enhanced the co-funding scheme for couples to tap on up to two of the six co-funded ART cycles when the wife is aged 40 and above, if she had attempted an ACP before 40. We will continue to review the MediSave withdrawal limits to balance between supporting couples with their cost of treatment today, and ensuring they have sufficient savings for healthcare in old age.",
            "While public Assisted Reproduction centres currently provide couples undergoing ACP with emotional support and social counselling, we will do more with community partners to provide holistic support and remove stigma for those seeking fertility checks or treatment.",
            "Ms Hany Soh, who has asked for information to be disseminated to first-time parents, will be glad to know that the MSF's Baby Bonus Parenting Resources, or BBPR, Pregnancy Keepsake Journal, provides tips on pregnancy and parenthood. This will be piloted at maternity hospitals and selected private obstetrics clinics, complementing MSF's BBPR website, and HPB's e-toolkits for expectant mothers and new parents.",
            "But we can always do better. With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I ask the Clerks to distribute an infographic showing the key enhancements this year. Members may also access these materials through the SG PARL MP mobile app.",
            "While most married Singaporeans wish to have two or more children, and the majority still do, a growing number have only one child. Some Singaporean couples have shared their worries about the costs of having a second child, even though they very much want to. Currently, the support from Government to parents for their second child is the same as their first. We reviewed this and will provide more support for couples having their second child. We will double the maximum dollar-for-dollar Government co-matching of parents' savings in the Child Development Account (CDA) for the second child, from $3,000 to $6,000. This is in addition to the $3,000 CDA First Step Grant that parents receive upon opening the CDA.",
            "With this enhancement, the maximum total Government contributions for the second child's CDA will increase from $6,000 to $9,000. All Singapore Citizen, or SC, children who are the second child, and whose date of birth or estimated date of delivery is on or after 1 January 2021, will be eligible. About 12,000 children will benefit annually.",
            "The one-time $200 CDA top-up, announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng on Budget Day, as part of the Household Support Package, will provide additional support.",
            "Ms Carrie Tan has championed greater gender equality in caring for children and asked to set aside two months from the current four months of maternity leave, as paternity leave. She also asked for tax incentives to nudge fathers to use them.",
            "We agree that the active involvement of fathers is critical to the wellbeing of children and their partners. Today, fathers can already share up to one month of their wives' maternity leave under the Shared Parental Leave Scheme, on top of two weeks of paternity leave. However, only about 5% of fathers use this flexibility. Some couples also prefer to reserve all 16 weeks of maternity leave for mothers to recuperate and bond with their child.",
            "Hence, we are cautious about requiring fathers to take more of mothers' existing maternity leave. We would first urge fathers to take their paternity leave. Since the introduction of Paternity Leave, take-up rates have increased from 25% in 2013 to 53% in 2018. It is encouraging that more fathers have been taking time off to care for their new-borns, and we hope this signals a stronger shift towards greater shared parental responsibility.",
            "Some working fathers and adoptive mothers may not qualify for paternity or adoption leave due to their employment arrangements. For example, they may be on multiple short-term employment contracts, or their employment contracts may have expired before the birth or adoption of their child.",
            "To better support this group of parents, we will introduce the Government-Paid Paternity Benefit (GPPB) and Government-Paid Adoption Benefit (GPAB). This is similar to the current Government-Paid Maternity Benefit for working mothers, where a cash benefit is given in lieu of the Government-paid share of leave if their employment circumstances do not qualify them for leave. This will apply to parents whose children's date of birth, estimated date of delivery, or formal intent to adopt, is on or after 1 January 2021. About 500 working fathers and adoptive mothers would benefit from GPPB and GPAB annually. More details on the eligibility criteria and application process will be shared later.",
            "I move on now to a workforce with a strong Singaporean Core.",
            "The pandemic has also given us an opportunity to transform our workforce and reduce our reliance on lower skilled foreign workers. From June 2019 to June 2020, our total population declined slightly by 0.3% due to a decrease in foreign employment in the services sector, and Work Permit holders. S Pass and Employment Pass (EP) holders have also decreased amid the pandemic due to travel restrictions and the economic downturn. The Government continues to maintain a tight stance on our foreign worker manpower policy.",
            "COVID-19 has accelerated efforts for businesses to transform business models and improve productivity. At the same time, we will continue to partner businesses to train and retain local workers and strengthen the Singaporean Core of our workforce.",
            "We must also remain open to global talent who can complement our local workforce and attract high-value activities that create quality jobs for locals. That is why we have tightened the EP criteria and sharpened our tools, such as the Tech@SG and the Tech.Pass. We set a high bar for these schemes and are very selective. The talent base will help us emerge stronger, by anchoring and expanding new growth sectors.",
            "For example, Mr Timo Recker and Mr Andre Menezes, from Germany and Brazil, co-founded agri-food tech start-up Next Gen Foods in Singapore in early 2020. They bring with them experience in alternative protein and food distribution. The team is developing plant-based foods, including an alternative chicken product. Next Gen Food Technologist Ms Claudia Lee, who majored in Food Science at NUS, said it was a dream come true to work directly with leading global experts in plant-based foods. By working with global talent, more Singaporeans like Claudia can deepen their expertise in growth areas.",
            "Finally, we will continue to carefully calibrate the pace of immigration. In 2020, we granted about 21,100 new citizens, and 27,500 new Permanent Residents (PRs). These figures are lower than previous years due to travel restrictions and operational issues arising from COVID-19. For example, safe management measures resulted in limited slots to complete the final steps for PR and citizenship registration, which must be done in-person.",
            "Hence, a few thousand applicants, who were approved in-principle, had not completed all the required processes to be granted their PR or citizenship respectively by end-2020. Depending on how the COVID-19 situation evolves, these applicants could be granted PR or citizenship in the coming months and may add to the numbers normally granted this year.",
            "We continue to carefully select new PRs and citizens, and welcome those who have committed to making Singapore their home. We take in immigrants not just based on their ability to contribute to Singapore, but also their ability to integrate.",
            "As Ms Denise Phua has acknowledged, foreign spouses have family ties to Singapore and our policies are already facilitative for those in genuine and stable marriages. Widowed or divorced foreign spouses, with custody of minor Singaporean children, will generally be allowed to stay here on a Long-term Visit Pass (LTVP) until the child becomes an adult. They can also qualify for a Letter of Consent from MOM which will allow them to work and care for their Singaporean children here. While it is not possible to guarantee PR or citizenship to any foreigner, foreign spouses are generally considered more favourably, especially when they have Singaporean children.",
            "We must continue to build a community that is inclusive and united. In the past year, we saw many uplifting positive examples of Singaporeans and foreigners rallying together to help battle the COVID-19 crisis. For example, Ms Chong Pek Lian from Malaysia contributed to the COVID-19 battle as a contact tracer at Sengkang General Hospital. Despite the long hours and heavy workload, she was glad to help reduce the spread of the virus.",
            "Singaporeans also gave help, support and appreciation for our foreign workers who have contributed to our society, such as those in healthcare and construction. Many have continued to carry out their duties here and have not been able to see their families throughout this period. Our society will be stronger if all who call Singapore home and believe in our vision are empowered to make Singapore a better place.",
            "The Government will continue to work with a range of stakeholders to build our future together and emerge stronger post-COVID. We have consulted Singaporeans widely on population-related issues. For instance, in 2019, we convened a Citizens' Panel to tackle the tricky issue of improving work-life harmony, which affects marriage and parenthood.",
            "In 2020, we also worked with the Citizens' Workgroup to co-develop new curriculum and programmes for the Singapore Citizenship Journey. This initiative explored what it means to be Singaporean, including our shared values and duty to contribute to society. We agree with Miss Cheng Li Hui that the Government's strategies for encouraging marriage and parenthood need to account for shifts in life priorities and societal norms.",
            "As part of the Emerging Stronger Conversations, Minister of State Sun Xueling and I will lead a series of conversations on \"Building A Singapore Made For Families\", from April to September this year. We want to better understand how the thinking and aspirations of Singaporeans, at different stages of their Marriage and Parenthood journey, may have changed due to the pandemic. Ms Denise Phua will be glad to know that the engagements will include transnational families, who may face unique challenges after deciding to make Singapore home. We will work together with the rest of society to better support all families in Singapore and shape an environment in which we can make time for things that matter.",
            "Our post-COVID world will require population strategies that keep us resilient and cohesive. Together, let us continue to build a Singapore that is a home for all Singaporeans and emerge stronger as a nation.",
            "Let me now go on to separately address the cut by Mr Pritam Singh on corruption. I think he made some general comments at the start about the status of corruption, and I just wanted to refer to the CPIB Report for 2019. This indicates that the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index for 2019 ranked Singapore fourth out of 180 countries and territories with a high score of 85. And in the latest Political and Economic Risk Consultancy 2020 corruption survey, Singapore maintained top position and improved its score to 1.73 as compared to a score of 1.85 the previous year, zero being the best score.",
            "In 2019, CPIB received 350 corruption-related reports compared to 358 in 2018. And in 2019, the percentage of corruption-related reports registered for investigation increased to 34% compared to the annual average of 28% over the preceding four years, but generally speaking, we are doing well on that front and the cases have been prosecuted with all due dispatch.",
            "Mr Singh asked for update on two cases. I think it was the Keppel Offshore and Marine and I believe FAS.",
            "On Keppel Offshore and Marine, this case is complex and transnational, involving multiple authorities and potential foreign witnesses from several countries. The Singapore authorities have been working closely with foreign investigating and prosecuting agencies on the matter. As part of the on-going investigation, AGC and CPIB had made two fact-finding trips to Brazil in May and August 2019. As there is a need to obtain additional information from other witnesses based overseas, AGC and CPIB have worked together to send a mutual legal assistance, MLA request to Brazil following the earlier fact-finding trips. The MLA request is pending their response.",
            "AGC and CPIB are also working together to send more MLA requests to other relevant foreign authorities to interview these potential witnesses. While our intention is to move as expeditiously as possible, not all aspects of the investigation are within our control, particularly in relation to the requests and applications made and filed in other jurisdictions.",
            "The current COVID-19 situation globally has also made the cross-jurisdiction investigation efforts more challenging. CPIB is unable to comment further on the case, so as to protect the integrity of investigations, which are confidential in nature and to avoid prejudicing any prosecutorial decision that might follow. CPIB remains resolute and committed to combat corruption and will continue to pursue the case to its end.",
            "With respect to the FAS case, I am afraid that when Mr Pritam Singh filed the cut on corruption, normally you have to indicate the gist of the cut. And the gist of the cut which is indicated to Parliament and then given to the Ministries, only indicated update on Keppel investigations; so, I am sorry I do not have the information on FAS. But perhaps, Mr Singh might like to file a Parliamentary Question on that.",

            ": Mr Speaker, Sir, let me, on behalf of the Prime Minister, address the cut from Mr Murali on the CPIB.",
            "First, let me thank Mr Murali for recognising the efforts of CPIB in keeping corruption at bay. Corruption is under control in Singapore but we must never be complacent. The findings from CPIB's 2020 Public Perception Survey saw strong public confidence in our national anti-corruption efforts, with the following cited as the top three success factors contributing to the low corruption rate in Singapore: first, the political determination to keep corruption at bay; second, the heavy punishments; and third, the anti-corruption laws that are effective.",
            "The Prevention of Corruption Act has served Singapore well and remains an effective instrument. The review of this Act by CPIB is underway. CPIB has been working in consultation with AGC on a comprehensive list of provisions for the review, some of which included the disgorgement of corrupt benefits from perpetrators and strengthening the protection of informers' identity. CPIB will provide more information on the review when it is ready together with AGC.",
            "But having said that, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I would like to emphasise one particular point that has come up from the various threads. And that is, our reputation as a clean and corruption-free country is hard-won and is not something that we take for granted. Looking at our history, we know that such things may happen now and then, involving all strata of society. But regardless of who is involved, which organisation is involved, nobody will be above the law and CPIB, together with the rest of the enforcement agencies will get to the bottom of each and every case, because the reputation of Singapore, the kind of values that we exhibit must be above all other considerations. So, it is a hard-fought reputation, it is hard-won but we must never be complacent because it is a job that will never be done and we must never let our guard down.",
            "Next, I will address the cuts from Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Melvin Yong on the Public Service's efforts to enhance employability, employment practices and build capabilities.",
            "Mr Patrick Tay asked how the Public Service has helped Singaporeans impacted by the pandemic. We have worked with unions and other partners to place some 21,000 local workers so far in short-term and long-term jobs and traineeships across the public sector. They came from all age groups, including mature workers, and we remain committed to supporting the needs of workers through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills effort.",
            "But we are clear that in the longer term, with an ageing and shrinking local workforce, we must help our people work longer with new capabilities. Therefore, the Public Service will raise its retirement and re-employment ages to 63 and 68 respectively from 1 July 2021, one year ahead of the national schedule, as earlier committed.",
            "Mr Melvin Yong spoke about supporting public officers' lifelong employability, through good workforce and workplace practices. We agree. Key to this is re-skilling our officers to continually upgrade their skillsets to keep up with the new job demands. Since 2019, we have worked with the unions to upskill thousands of officers in areas such as basic digital literacy, data analytics and adapting to career and work-life transitions.",
            "We are also developing public officers through job rotations and attachments to the private and people sectors. Officers learn best practices to bring back to the public sector. So far, we have worked with over 50 partners to attach over 90 officers from more than 30 agencies to such organisations and we will continue to expand this scheme further.",
            "Mid-career hires into the Civil Service also accounted for over 45% of all hires in the past five years. We welcome more mid-career hires to join us and contribute their skillsets and experiences to public sector work.",
            "We are implementing progressive workplace practices to build a more collaborative and caring Public Service. We have implemented flexible work arrangements like enabling more officers to adopt hybrid work arrangements. We are doing more to promote workplace health and mental wellness. For instance, we are starting a Service-wide programme to train mental wellness ambassadors to provide peer support and care for co-workers.",
            "We are also making concerted efforts to strengthen the Public Service’s capability to serve Singapore. We have been investing in technology as a key driver of Public Sector Transformation. Many of our COVID-19 responses were underpinned by technology, like A*STAR and TTSH’s Fortitude test-kit, and HTX’s autonomous robot M.A.T.A.R deployed to patrol dormitories.",
            "We are leveraging technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) for policy-making, service delivery and operations. The MSO One Service App uses AI-enabled routing of residents’ feedback. Public officers working in science, technology and engineering (STE) roles will be developed in niche areas like power engineering, modelling and simulation. We welcome more aspiring scientists and engineers into the Public Service.",
            "Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Service will continue to transform ourselves and continue to develop our workforce to prepare our people for a longer career within the Public Service. At the same time, we will increase the porosity between the Public Service and the private and people sector, so that we can gather experiences from all across the nation for the good of our country.",

Is that correct? Because if so, by the time they can apply for PR will be actually quite late. And many of them would have Singaporean roots and the children and the families would all be here.

            "Others have more recent prominence but have, nevertheless, become rapidly influential. Canada's Parliamentary Budget Officer was established in 2006. The United Kingdom's Office for Budget Responsibility was formally constituted in 2010 and most fiscal councils within the EU were set up following the European Fiscal Compact in 2012.",
            "Importantly, fiscal councils are independent and are expected to provide non-partisan assessments of the expected effects of policy on revenue and expenditure. As such, they serve as trusted public institutions that can help score, reform ideas and proposals to help ensure the economy's commitment to sustainable public finances. The support functions that fiscal councils offer include public assessments of fiscal plans and performance and evaluation of all provision of macro-economic and budgetary forecasts.",
            "While these functions may already be performed to some degree by MOF, MOF reports to the government of the day. In contrast, the fiscal council will provide advice and the key here is advice as they do not possess any formal power to determine the Budget to the whole of Parliament at their request. As such, the Council will be available to scrutinise policy proposals offered by PAP backbenchers as well as Opposition parties.",
            "I should point out that a proposal to form an independent Office of Budget Responsibility was raised by Mr Low Thia Khiang of the Workers' Party in 2017's Committee of Supply debates, This proposal builds on that, detailing the functions of the proposed agency and its service to the full legislature, and underscore the distinct macro-economic environment of the day.",
            "There is evidence that fiscal councils can improve fiscal performance, especially when such Councils enjoy legal and operational independence, are tasked with monitoring fiscal rules and are supported by a robust media presence. Moreover, an independent fiscal council can be especially useful at this juncture in our economic evolution, given how we are currently running the largest Budget deficit since Independence, with substantial uncertainty over the likely future evolution of our economy.",
            "Unlike the past where our Government has run balanced Budgets over successive terms and, hence, we may have had little need for this institution, there was an unprecedented deficit over the last term of Government which necessitated a draw on past reserves. I propose that the MOF consider the formation of an independent fiscal council, the Parliamentary Budget Office of Singapore seeded with an initial $20 million and tasked with the mandate to score all major policy proposals, formally advanced by Members of Parliament for budgetary and macro implications."

In the US, for example, it is known that in the past, NASA might have seeded technology to American companies, technology that arose from the state-funded space effort. I have spoken in the House about this before.",
            "The nexus between state research institutes and research centres on the one hand and local companies on the other, is not non-existent. For example, some new initiatives were rolled out in 2018 to try to ease the process by which local firms can engage with the R&D capabilities residing in our RIs and RCs. However, I still hear anecdotally that local firms find this process not altogether easy to navigate and that there is a perception that those local firms, able to write and present their proposals well or those that hire consultants, are best able to navigate this process as opposed to those with the best ideas.",
            "I would like to suggest that the NRF be tasked with a number of hard mandates: firstly, that KPIs be set for engaging the local firms on co-generating or supporting the generation of commercialisable IP, with the economic impact and multipliers of that IP being measured and tracked going forward. This is in line with one of the themes of my Budget debate speech that we should score an \"A\" for outcomes, not only an \"A\" for effort.",

            "Mr Chairman, Temasek and GIC, no doubt compare their performance against various global market indices and other standards of performance internally. It would be useful for these Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) to publish these comparisons in the analysis for the reasons for better assessment of their performance. In fact, it would be useful for the Government in the form of MOF to understand these comparisons in some detail.",
            "With that said, I would like to ask how does the MOF itself assess that the SWFs Boards and management have done a reasonable job in terms of returns. What internal metrics, indices and benchmarks and processes are used?",
            "In the case of Temasek, the MSCI is used as a reference. As I understand it, Temasek also sets its own hurdle rate at a risk adjusted cost of capital that its market value TSR has under-performed on the one, three, 10 and 20-year periods, as of March 2020. It has argued that its under-performance relative to the risk adjusted cost of capital is because it is making a systemic shift to build resilience for the future. I would like to ask does the Government have clarity on the transformation Temasek is undertaking and why they think the future rate of return will outperform the current rate of return on these new investment strategies?",
            "Reserves Draw-downs",
            "Last cut on reserve spending. Mr Chairman, the reserves consist of various classes of assets held by Temasek, GIC and the MAS, if we are to exclude land banks.",
            "During typical economic crises some asset value such as equities may fall on the whole. This is fairly typical. If a result draw-down is financed by liquidating assets in a time of crisis, this may not necessarily be advantageous for Singapore since it may mean selling fundamentally good assets, such as shares and good blue chip companies, for example, at low prices rather than hanging on to those assets to realise future value when the economy recovers.",
            "However, if the reserves draw-down is financed by borrowing against the collateral of the reserves, that may in some circumstances prove to be more advantages to Singapore, especially given that interest rates may be lower in a time of global economic crisis as central banks slash the cost of credit to financial institutions as they often do. Or is the first line of execution for reserves draw-down utilising cash or cash equivalents held by the MAS or other institutions?",
            "Hence, I would like to use this cut to ask the Government what is the operating principle that determines how reserves draw-downs are financed and executed with these considerations and questions in mind?",
            "And in conclusion, I just like to add that I am aware that during the COVID-19 period, some sectors and some stock exchanges and market indices actually rose. In that sense, this crisis has been atypical. My comments earlier referred to more typical global economic crisis.",

This can reduce long tail costs.",

Organic waste is transported through a system of pipes to an onsite digester which could up-cycle waste into useful products. Such a system reduces overall cleaning and haulage cost due to lesser need for point-to-point transportation, allowing for a reduction in carbon footprint too. Value for money and value for good.",
            "I also would like to recommend training in deep sector technical knowledge for relevant public officers so that procurement tenders are scoped with the best outcome. Creating more secondment opportunities for public officers to be attached to high growth Singapore businesses to gain first-hand experience would also be ideal. Having equipped with industry technical knowledge would allow for all translation work to be more effective, alongside with industry feedback and insights.",

Aspirations for better housing is particularly pertinent for residents aged 35 and below, with 73% aspiring to upgrade according to the HDB's latest sample household survey.",
            "Enabling financially able Singaporeans to upgrade from HDB to private not only fulfils their aspirations, but it also eases demand for homes in the public residential market. While Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) has helped reduce excessive demand for property investments, it has also affected genuine HDB owners to upgrade to a private property.",
            "An HDB owner today has to pay 12% ABSD upfront within 14 days of signing the S&P agreement for a private property if he or she has not already sold their current home. Given the rising prices of private property, 12% is no small amount, even though this could be remitted for married couples once they sell their first residential property within the specified timeline. This experience is different for a HDB owner who upgrades to an Executive Condominium (EC) or even buying another larger HDB unit. The Government grants semi-automatic ABSD remission providing them six months after collecting the keys to sell the flat.",

            "So, we continually prioritise and reallocate funds to key areas of greater needs across the whole-of-Government so that it is not just about additional spending but also about re-prioritisation. As an example, in the October Ministerial Statement, Deputy Prime Minister Heng highlighted that MOF had re-directed funding of about $8 billion from areas with reduced spending, such as development projects that were delayed due to COVID-19, towards funding our fight towards COVID-19. Clearly, something which was of priority.",
            "Second, we have joint budgeting arrangements for cross-cutting domains, to better align priorities and reduce duplication of resources across different agencies. Joint budgets have been set up in the areas of jobs and skills, vaccines and therapeutics, Smart Nation and Digital Government as well as in Research, Innovation and Enterprise.",
            "Ms Foo asked how we evaluate the return on investment for support schemes directed towards new areas of development. As with all Government programmes, we monitor the output and outcomes of our programmes and schemes to ensure that their purposes are met. We also review whether to scale, refine, or sunset programmes depending on their outcomes.",
            "For example, for digitalisation programmes, we look at digital adoption rate and digital readiness across the sectors.",
            "For enterprise development programmes, we monitor the growth of benefiting companies like revenue, to holistically assess how well the scheme objectives are met.",
            "For Research and Development or R&D, we continuously seek to refine the way by which we assess and monitor the impact of our investments. We currently track a basket of indicators, which include Business Expenditure on Research and Development, the number of successful start-ups supported by Research, Innovation and Enterprise or RIE programmes, and the number of research projects that are undertaken in collaboration with the industry.",
            "In this regard, Mr Leon Perera asked about enhancing the economic impact of research spending. This is an area where we share common objectives. We too in MOF would like to enhance the economic impact of everything that we spend. We want to achieve an \"A\" score not just for effort but for outcomes too. We want to have \"As\" in all areas.",
            "We continue to place a strong focus on ensuring that RIE investments develop the capabilities needed to catalyse economic growth. At the same time, we recognise that some investments in basic research are essential and are important and they should continue to be maintained for laying the foundations of downstream breakthroughs. The nature of basic research is that they may not always have direct translational outcomes. Or even if they do, the outcomes may take time to materialise and manifest themselves. Mr Perera highlighted some examples in America. Indeed, if you look at the American examples or even in Israel, some of the basic research is done with very little direct and immediate outcomes because the economic outcomes bear fruits many, many years later.",
            "In Singapore, we have a similar example of our biomedical sciences. We started investing in R&D in biomedical science in 2000. More than 20 years have passed. The initial years were not easy but we stayed the course. We had patient capital and today, our investments have set the stage for the flourishing Biomedical Science (BMS) sector. As Deputy Prime Minister mentioned just now in his Round-Up speech, the biomedical sector in Singapore today makes up about 4% of our GDP, and four of the world's top 10 drugs by global revenue are made in Singapore.",
            "RIE activities have also helped to catalyse private sector research and innovation activity and to establish a vibrant innovation and enterprise eco-system.",
            "We have created high quality jobs. The number of industry research scientists and engineers, or RSEs, has tripled. These are industry RSEs, not Government. Industry RSEs has tripled from about 6,500 to over 19,000, in the 20 years from 1998 to 2018. Beyond the immediate impact on RSEs, RIE investments have also indirectly contributed to good jobs in the rest of the economy, by keeping industries and businesses competitive globally.",
            "In the same period of time, Business Expenditure on R&D has increased by more than two-and-a-half times, from $1.5 billion in 1998 to approximately $5.6 billion in 2018. So, these are the outcomes that we have achieved and we will continually strive to do better.",
            "In response to Mr Liang's question on accountability for spending outcomes, we continue to strengthen governance and accountability over the outcomes of our spending, including strengthening the value-for-money culture across all Government agencies.",
            "Infrastructure projects are evaluated for their worthiness and cost-effectiveness, before the Government embarks on them. For larger projects, Ministries' proposals and MOF's evaluations are further scrutinised by the Development Projects Advisory Panel, which comprises technical experts from the private sector and academia. Over the past five years, these processes have led to design improvements and generated savings of about $4 billion in total or about 5% of the capital costs.",
            "For example, MOF worked with LTA to improve the proposed design for the Sengkang West multi-storey bus depot-cum-dormitory, including right-sizing the space for housing mechanical and electrical equipment and common areas, and green roof areas. These changes helped to reduce the estimated cost by about $70 million.",
            "For day-to-day operational spending, public agencies also proactively look out for ways to spend prudently. For example, MOH's Agency for Care Effectiveness evaluates the clinical-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of medicines, vaccines and medical technologies and then negotiates fair prices with companies. This has delivered total cost savings of $300 million between 2016 and 2020.",
            "I also thank Mr Edward Chia for his suggestion on making greater use of design to optimise cost effectiveness over the lifespan of infrastructure projects. Indeed, the Government adopts a life-cycle cost perspective during upfront planning and in the design of infrastructure projects. This improves visibility of long-term resourcing requirements. It allows us to optimise the combination of upfront costs and downstream maintenance and operating costs.",
            "In this way, we avoid having projects, be it buildings or infrastructure, that may be cheaper to build but are expensive to maintain and operate and, in fact, on an overall basis, end up being more expensive. And so, by taking this approach, we expect to bring about savings of 2% to 5% in total life-cycle costs over the long-term, which is a significant sum given that we spend about $15 billion to $20 billion every year on capital expenditure alone.",
            "Ms Foo spoke about the need for governance and accountability over the use of public funds, even as we were responding to the COVID-19 situation. Indeed, when coming up with support schemes, agencies do make full use of a whole range of tools. They considered the possibilities of fraud and unintended beneficiaries upfront in scheme designs. They deployed various monitoring mechanism and safeguards, at pre-disbursement and post-disbursement stages, to ensure that funds are disbursed to the appropriate beneficiaries.",
            "Specifically, on the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), this was introduced at the start of the crisis when the public health and economic situation was highly fluid, and when firms were facing immediate cashflow issues. The priority then was to ensure that all firms received timely support, so that they could focus on retaining their workers and sustaining their operations. The JSS was implemented as a broad-based scheme then, without the need for onerous applications. This was especially helpful for SMEs.",
            "As the economic situation improved and with actual data on sectoral and firm performance, we then stepped down our broad-based support measures and pivoted towards more targeted, sector-specific measures. In fact, we began tapering JSS support levels from September 2020. For sectors that managed well, we ceased JSS support after December 2020.",
            "In this Budget, we extended the JSS for Tier 1 sectors like aviation and tourism by six months. For Tier 2 sectors like land transport and retail, we extended by three months. For sectors that remain hard hit, we also introduced additional targeted measures like the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers to stimulate domestic tourism, and extended sector-specific support like the Aviation, Point-to-Point Support Packages and the Arts and Culture Resilience Package.",
            "This tiered approach has enabled us to bring targeted relief to business owners and the workers they are responsible for. We will continue to monitor the outcomes and effectiveness of COVID-19-related schemes. For example, MOF has published its interim assessment of the initial effects of the Government's measures to reduce business costs, save jobs and support families. Preliminary data suggests that the Jobs Support Scheme has reduced job losses in vulnerable firms, while loan schemes have supported over 20,000 firms in accessing loans.",
            "Next, let me talk about managing our investments and reserves.",
            "Mr Perera asked about the performance of our investment entities. We have had this debate before, this question has been raised multiple times and I have explained that both GIC and Temasek are long-term investors. Their remit is to secure good sustainable returns on a total portfolio basis over the long term.",
            "So, the relevant performance measure for them is not the year-to-year return which can fluctuate because of market volatility but sustained long-term returns over and above global inflation. If you look at that measure, both GIC and Temasek have indeed performed creditably over the long term. Their results are published in their annual reports and there is a full writeup explaining their decisions, their performance and the evaluation of their performance.",
            "Take GIC as an example. GIC in recent years, has recognised that there is high uncertainty in the equity markets, as well as high valuations, which can lead to large permanent portfolio impairment. As a result, GIC has undertaken pre-emptive measures to reduce portfolio risks. Nevertheless, despite reducing its risk exposure, GIC's returns on its portfolio, compared to a reference portfolio comprising 65% equities and 35% bonds; GIC's performance, despite a reduced risk, has been equal, if not better, than the reference portfolio. This has been so, over the rolling 20-year period. It has also been so over more intermediate periods, like a 10-year and five-year timeframe.",
            "So, I think if you look at the overall performance on the broader term, longer term, not just year-to-year, I think both GIC and Temasek have done creditably well in a very challenging investment environment.",
            "Going forward, how do we ensure that such performance continues? There is never any guarantee in investments. But all the processes are in place, by the Boards who supervise management, between MOF and the Boards to review the performances of these entities, and in discussions with external parties as well as investment advisory panels. Very prominent names in the investment community sit on these advisory panels to help us guide our two entities.",
            "On green investments, we have explained that both GIC and Temasek operate on a commercial basis, so their individual investment decisions are independent of the Government. Nevertheless, both entities acting on their own accord, emphasise sustainability in their investment activities, and that is because they recognise that good sustainability practices are good for business and can have a positive impact on long-term returns. Conversely, companies with poor sustainability practices carry business and reputational, as well as environmental, social and governance risks.",
            "GIC and Temasek integrate sustainability considerations holistically into their investment processes across all asset classes, so that they protect and enhance the long-term value of their investments. Both entities take a strong interest in not only understanding sustainability-related challenges, but also the opportunities for innovation, business growth and new investments.",
            "Both entities also support efforts by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, to develop an internationally accepted framework on climate reporting. This provides a framework for companies to disclose their climate-related strategies, and for investors to incorporate climate change considerations into long-term investment decisions. Both entities have also published comprehensive statements on their approach to sustainability and they will continue to review what additional information can be pulled out in their annual reports.",
            "In response to Mr Perera's question about reserves spending, let me just explain how the Government executes the spending of reserves during economic crises.",
            "The fiscal framework in the Constitution requires the Government to spend within its means. A draw on Past Reserves occurs if our revenues and surpluses accumulated during the current term of Government are unable to support our current spending.",

            "I was talking about dealing with the issue of the execution of the spending of reserves. So, in terms of our fiscal framework, we have clear rules on what constitutes a draw on past reserves, but where the Government obtains the cash to pay for expenditures is a different matter. That is part of the Government's overall cash flow management. It is an operational issue and is separate from the budgeting process.",
            "For purposes of cash flow management, the Government has a range of liquidity sources it can tap on, and this would include tax revenues which come in at different times of the year, funds raised outside the Budget, like proceeds from land sales. Constitutionally they do not contribute to the Budget and do not count as Government revenues, but they are part of the cash flow that the Government receives. It also includes Government deposits which we can draw on for purposes of cash flow reasons.",
            "So, all of these cash flows are pooled together and all of the sources of liquidity are pooled together and we manage cash flow on a disciplined and integrated basis. On top of these different sources, I have highlighted earlier in this House that the Government will be issuing Cash Management Treasury Bills. This is part of the Government's ongoing efforts to expand our cash management tool kit.",
            "With regard to the specific question asked by Mr Leon Perera, to pay for expenditures in fiscal year 2020, the Government was able to tap on all available sources of cash under the tool kits which I just described. So, GIC was not put in a position where it had to liquidate investments under time pressure.",
            "Finally, let me address Mr Louis Chua's questions about the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty, or ABSD, remission for Singaporean married couples. The aim of ABSD, I think we all know, is to moderate demand and to ensure a stable and sustainable residential property market. To be effective as a measure to moderate demand for property, ABSD has to be applied consistently and to all buyers.",
            "Only one exception is made, namely that is for Singaporean married couples. A Singaporean married couple may need to change homes due to changing family needs, such as when they have children, when their children are growing up, or when the couple needs to right-size in their senior years. It is in this context that we have an ABSD concession for Singaporean married couples buying a second residential property.",
            "Under this concession, we allow Singaporean married couples to claim a refund of the ABSD paid on their second property, provided they sell their first property within six months after the purchase of a completed property, or the Temporary Occupation Permit date of an uncompleted property. For those who are purchasing a HDB flat or a new Executive Condominium, they are granted upfront ABSD remission, as Mr Chua highlighted. This is because, they are subject to HDB regulations which require them to not own another residential property and to dispose of their existing property within HDB's stipulated timeframe. There are no such regulations for private residential properties and that is the reason why for such private residential property purchases, ABSD remission is only granted upon the sale of the first property within the required timeline, unlike the case of HDB.",
            "Mr Chairman, MOF is committed to ensuring that our overall fiscal system is fair and progressive, achieves good value-for-money outcomes, and importantly, sustainable over the long term. The Second Minister Ms Indranee will now address the other questions.",

            ": Thank you, Mr Chairman. Let me address the independent fiscal council and also earlier on, during the debate on the Budget Statement, there were a few confused looks around the Chamber, so I thought it will be helpful if I just explain what that was about.",
            "Mr Pritam Singh had suggested a Parliamentary Budget Office. In his response, the Deputy Prime Minister had referred to that as having a $20 million budget being requested for it. The reason why that was referred to was because, when Members of Parliament file cuts, they have to give an indication of what the cut is about, so that the Ministry can prepare. And in this case, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim had filed his gist that he proposed that MOF consider the formation of an independent fiscal council or the Parliamentary Budget Office of Singapore, seeded with an initial $20 million.",
            "Hence, I sought clarification from the Leader of the Opposition whether his Parliamentary Budget Office was the same as the independent fiscal council and the Leader of the Opposition kindly confirmed that they were actually the same. There is only one council that he is talking about. And we heard Assoc Prof Jamus Lim just now, who has confirmed that what he is asking is for a council that is set up at a proposed cost of $20 million. This is just so that everybody knows what everyone is speaking about.",
            "So, let me address Assoc Prof Jamus Lim's cut. In assessing the value of such a proposal, the fundamental starting point must always be: why? What is the need to be addressed? The Assoc Prof Jamus Lim ran us through various independent fiscal entities around the world. I will refer to them as Independent Fiscal Institutions, or IFIs.",
            "So, it is important to first understand the context in which such institutions are established. The setting up of IFIs around the world took place mainly in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 and 2009 where government deficits and debts were high.",
            "There were some which were established beforehand, for example, in the US and the Netherlands, but, primarily, the largest bulk of them were established after the Global Financial Crisis.",
            "So, more than half of the IFIs in the OECD today were established after the Global Financial Crisis and the main intent was to prevent future fiscal crises.",
            "In those cases, fiscal rules had proved insufficient to ensure prudent management of the public finances before the crisis. IFIs were set up to safeguard fiscal discipline, eradicate unreliable budgeting and rebuild public trust in policy-makers' capacity to manage public budgets prudently and transparently.",
            "However, the context in Singapore is very different. The ills which led to the need for IFIs in other systems are not present in our system and we continue to keep a very strict eye on our fiscal prudence. Markets have confidence in our system. We are among the small number of countries today that continue to enjoy a AAA credit rating.",
            "The Government has been disciplined in keeping to our fiscal rules and safeguards. We have run balanced Budgets in each term of Government, barring major crises. The draw on past reserves for COVID-19 relief, which was a crisis situation, was done in accordance with our Reserves Protection Framework.",
            "We have put in place a strong system to scrutinise spending and debate budgetary matters, without incurring the costs of setting up additional fiscal monitoring institutions.",
            "The Constitution requires us to run a balanced Budget over each term of Government and any departure would require the approval of the President.",
            "The Government is required under the Constitution to seek Parliament's approval for its expenditure and revenue during each year's Budget.",
            "The annual Budget Debate and Committee of Supply (COS) provide the opportunity for Members of Parliament to debate on and scrutinise Government policies and programmes.",
            "Under the Constitution, the Government cannot draw on the reserves accumulated by past terms of Government without the approval of the elected President.",
            "There is a standing Parliamentary Select Committee, the Estimates Committee, which examines the Government's Budget.",
            "The Government's accounts are audited by the Auditor-General's Office. The AGO's findings are reported to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), also another Parliamentary Committee, which can call on the relevant agencies to explain lapses or take corrective actions.",
            "More importantly, the Government has been upfront about the hard choices that we make on budgetary matters. For example, we have not shied away from highlighting the need to raise taxes to meet longer term increase in healthcare and social spending needs.",
            "Robust, intellectually honest analysis is important to foster more informed parliamentary debate. But ultimately, there is no substitute for having the political courage to make difficult budgetary choices.",
            "Members of an independent fiscal council are not elected representatives in Parliament. Their role is to advise, but the responsibility for making difficult decisions ultimately lies with the elected Government. Alice Rivlin, the founding chair of the US Congressional Budget Office, said this very well. She said that IFIs, I quote, \"can play an important role in ensuring realistic and well-informed debate based on honest numbers, focusing attention on the consequences of action (or inaction), and identifying more or less sustainable solutions to budget dilemmas. They cannot instil political courage to make unpopular decisions. Political leaders have to do that for themselves\".",
            "Setting up an independent fiscal council will not substitute for such courage. It will also not miraculously remove the structural drivers for higher healthcare and social expenditure, nor will it delay any painful changes.",
            "Based on the experience of other countries, did the setting up of IFIs solve their fiscal management issues? No, because, ultimately, we cannot outsource honest and upfront debate.",
            "We should focus our time and our energy on having robust, honest and constructive debates, deciding on the trade-offs and not delegate that responsibility to a third party.",
            "Forecasting is an inherently uncertain exercise, and independent institutions are not exempt from this uncertainty. So, the Office for Budget Responsibility, or OBR, in the UK has actually been criticised for overly optimistic forecasts and has had to downgrade its forecasts several times since it was set up.",
            "We recognise that there will always be uncertainty in forecasting and fiscal planning, but we cannot wish away more fundamental drivers of expenditure, particularly the increase in public health expenditure, as our population ages.",
            "Mr Chairman, I move on now to address some of the other cuts.",
            "On supporting social and environmental outcomes, Mr Desmond Choo asked how we can drive environmental and social outcomes through our funding and corporate regulatory levers.",
            "MOF allocates public resources, and uses tax, charges and corporate regulatory levers, in order to achieve broader societal objectives, including social and environmental outcomes. These measures work alongside public education efforts.",
            "We have more than doubled our spending in the social and environmental sectors over the last decade, and we have achieved good social outcomes.",
            "In the area of gender equality, Singapore reports our progress regularly to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. We have done relatively well in areas such as higher education attainment, and are closing the gender gap in labour force participation rates and wages.",
            "However, more can be done. In some metrics, such as women in corporate leadership, we still lag behind the most progressive countries. Women still shoulder most of the care-giving burden.",
            "For environmental outcomes, we have one of the lowest carbon emissions per dollar of GDP in the world. Building on this, we are working towards peaking our emissions around 2030, and achieving our long-term net-zero aspirations as soon as viable. To do so, we are supporting businesses and households to become more energy-efficient, among other initiatives. Businesses can tap on EDB's Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy (REG(E)) or NEA's Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F) for funding support to adopt energy-efficient technologies. However, there remain areas of improvement, such as our domestic recycling rate, which we hope to increase to 30% by 2030.",
            "On procurement, environmental sustainability requirements are already part of the consideration. For instance, agencies are required to buy energy-efficient appliances, and Government buildings are required to achieve Green Mark standards. We will continue to enhance these requirements in support of GreenGov.SG.",
            "Mr Choo also suggested using the corporate regulatory lever. There are existing disclosure requirements for listed companies. For example, the Code of Corporate Governance requires listed companies to disclose their board diversity policy in the company's annual report. The Singapore Exchange (SGX) Listing Rules require listed companies to prepare annual sustainability reports.",
            "The Government is mindful that a unified international sustainability framework has yet to be agreed upon and is monitoring international developments closely. We will take these into account in studying when it would be feasible and timely to introduce sustainability reporting for non-listed companies.",
            "Besides the efforts made by the Government, businesses, organisations and individuals must all play their part in changing their mindsets and accepting new societal norms. I encourage the various stakeholders to step up and help us achieve better environmental and social outcomes together.",
            "I move on now to the other cuts.",
            "Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how MOF exercised agility and flexibility to flow assistance quickly to businesses and citizens. In response to COVID-19, our priority was to flow assistance to those affected as quickly as possible.",
            "For example, the CPF Board and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) enhanced their processes to speed up disbursements of the Jobs Support Scheme, or JSS. This enabled the JSS payouts to be brought forward by three months, from July 2020 to April 2020. The JSS has helped to keep our unemployment rate in check.",
            "We also facilitated faster payment to Government suppliers to ease their cashflows. During the pandemic, we went the extra mile to pay businesses as early as possible, rather than when the payment is due, which is typically 30 days from the invoice date. As of end January 2021, about 90% of invoices less than $5,000 were paid within an average of 12 days, benefiting about 4,500 businesses, comprising mostly SMEs.",
            "We exercised flexibility in applying regulations on businesses in view of the COVID-19 disruptions. The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, or ACRA, extended the deadline to hold Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and file annual returns for companies. ACRA also worked closely with MAS, Singapore Exchange Regulation and other agencies to facilitate virtual AGMs. An estimated 120,000 eligible companies can benefit from this.",
            "Mr Saktiandi also asked how we coped with the increased workload. The Public Service mobilised manpower resources within and across agencies to help our frontline operations. On top of that, we also hired temporary staff. For example, MSF hired more than 300 temporary staff in 2020, with many redeployed from the aviation sector, to ensure prompt accessing of the COVID-19 Support Grant.",
            "I agree with Ms Foo Mee Har that it is important for the Government to step up our collaborations and increase partnership to co-create solutions with businesses and the community.",
            "Through a mix of traditional and digital media and engagement platforms, we reached out to 50% more Singaporeans during our recent Budget engagements, as compared to the previous year. We received suggestions from close to 9,000 Singaporeans. Agencies considered the suggestions and refined our support scheme parameters to benefit more citizens and businesses. For example, we carefully evaluated feedback and included the coverage of qualifying shareholder-directors' wages under the JSS since May 2020.",
            "Mr Chairman, I notice that my time will be running out, and I do have a little more to cover. Since we are still within the guillotine time, may I have your permission to continue?",

            "MOF is leading efforts to raise public sector capabilities in essential functions, such as finance, procurement, grants management, shared services and internal audit. These functions play vital roles in ensuring the Government spends prudently, effectively and accountably. When these functions perform well, agencies can focus on their core missions of helping businesses, citizens and the community. MOF has re-organised ourselves and formed dedicated offices to drive these efforts.",
            "To strengthen grants management, MOF established a new grants governance framework last year that sets out rules and guidance that cover all stages of a grant – from grant design, approval and disbursement, to monitoring and fraud detection. The Grants Governance Office was formed to drive its implementation and raise agencies' capabilities to ensure proper financial governance.",
            "We are transforming Government procurement to buy more smartly and effectively. MOF set up the Government Procurement Function Office last year to drive efforts to transform and strengthen the Government's procurement function. We are taking further steps to consolidate the procurement of facilities management services of Government buildings. A central team with deeper expertise would manage these premises, instead of smaller, decentralised teams. This provides the scale for service providers to adopt more innovative, less manpower intensive solutions to manage the facilities, and is in line with our industry transformation efforts.",
            "As a start, we have consolidated the facilities management of The Treasury and Revenue House. This has resulted in estimated annual savings of $1.2 million. It also enabled the adoption of innovative technology solutions that facilitate workflow automation, data analytics and access to real-time data, which has improved service delivery at reduced costs.",
            "As Mr Chia pointed out, we need to develop public officers with deep sector technical knowledge. The Finance and Procurement Academy set up by MOF is working with agencies such as the Building and Construction Authority and GovTech to deepen technical know-how in specialised procurement areas such as contract management for construction and Infocomm Technology. We will also be facilitating attachment stints and exchange programmes with the private sector to enable our officers to stay abreast of the latest professional and industry developments.",
            "In response to Ms Foo and Ms Tan's questions, as we strengthen the public sector capabilities and processes, we are also adopting more pervasive digitalisation in our processes. These efforts also help spur digital transformation in the private sector. For instance, MOF and GovTech are partnering businesses to co-create a solution which facilitates public officers to make smaller value purchases on commercial digital platforms.",
            "We are currently piloting this with Eezee and Shopee, and will be onboarding more e-commerce platforms progressively in the coming months. This solution not only helps us save processing time, it also incentivises vendors to digitalise and bring their businesses online.",
            "Ms Foo also asked if local businesses could re-use Government developed capabilities. Minister Vivian Balakrishnan earlier mentioned various collaborations between Government and the private sector, like SGFinDex, to deliver solutions. GovTech has also launched the Singapore Government Developer Portal in December 2020. This one-stop resource site enables tech developers to discover the latest Government IT solutions to build on and integrate into their applications.",

I think some Members had asked questions about the processes in which these procurements could be done quickly. I had explained then that we do have Emergency Procurement provisions in place where for such cases, there are provisions for agencies to make use of these Emergency Procurement provisions in order to buy services more promptly. And indeed, these were made use of last year during the crisis and when we had, in particular, to respond very quickly.",

And would not a second opinion on how our fiscal prospects are going forward into the future be valued, especially, as I emphasised in my cut, that this would be in the form of advisory nature rather than as law?",
            "The second point that I thought would be useful to point out is that in the proposal, I had indicated that the independent fiscal council would actually serve all of this House. And so, if by implication, does that mean that we should regard all proposals by all Members of this House as equally, fiscally credible that whatever estimates provided should be regarded as equally trustworthy as long as they are put on the table. So, in part, you can think of it as not purely a constraint on the Government, which does have a very good track record, as I have explained, but also on proposals that are offered by Members of this House. They may not have enjoyed as long and illustrious a track record."

So yes, it has changed, but the important thing is this – what is the difference between Singapore and the other countries who have needed the IFIs or their own fiscal councils? They got themselves heavily into debt. They borrowed. They would not raise taxes when they needed to. Some did not display the political courage that was needed in order to maintain a balanced budget.",
            "Singapore on the other hand – thanks to the foresight of our pioneering PAP leaders – set aside our reserves, refused to squander the reserves, put in place a constitutional framework which required us to run a balanced Budget and to make sure that any time that we had to dip into the reserves, it was for good reason and put in place a framework where you could use the income on the reserves, but set in place a certain limit.",

            "When the OBR in the UK was set up, it was done so by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne, and this is what he said when he set up the OBR, because it was set up by the Tory government. He said, \"Over the last 13 years, the public and the markets have completely lost confidence in government economic forecasts. The last government's forecast for growth in the economy over the past 10 years have, on average, been out by £13 billion. Their forecasts of the budget deficit three years ahead have on average been out by £40 billion. Unsurprisingly, these forecasting errors have almost always been in the wrong direction.",
            "The conclusion is clear. We need long-lasting change in the way we put together budgets in this country. The final decision on the forecast has always been made by the Chancellor, not independent officials. And that is precisely the problem. Again and again, the temptation to fiddle the figures, to nudge up a growth forecast here or reduce a borrowing number there to make the numbers add up has proved too great...We need to fix the budget to fit the figures and not fix the figures to fit the budget. To do this, I am today establishing a new independent Office for Budget Responsibility. For the first time, we will have a truly independent assessment of the state of the nation's finances.\"",
            "That was the scenario that prompted the setting up of the OBR. That scenario is not present in Singapore, and for that, we have very good civil servants and agencies to thank, who keep us straight, who keep us narrow, who keep us honest.",
            "And he asked whether a second opinion is valued. Well, I have explained firstly why it is not necessary. But I also want to go on to point out that in the UK, after setting up the OBR, it has not necessarily been the case that they have been on target. So, the second opinion, well, in 2012, the OBR admitted it had a poor forecasting record. The OBR had predicted economic growth six times stronger than the latest official figures suggested.",
            "And in August 2020, the Institute for Fiscal Studies or the IFS described the OBR's \"upside scenario\" economic forecasts for UK GDP as \"extraordinarily optimistic\". So, second opinion does not always settle the issue.",
            "With regard to the second clarification, the learned Member said that the council he is proposing will serve the full Parliament. The suggestion really is that, okay, this is going to be for everybody. And he asked whether in the absence of such a fiscal council, all suggestions will be treated with the same regard.",
            "Well, the Parliament comprises the Members of Parliament who form the Government, the Members of Parliament who are part of the Ruling Party's backbenchers and the Opposition Members of Parliament. Insofar as proposals are put forward by the Government, these are assessed by the Civil Service. The Government has an idea of the costing of its proposals and how it should be dealt with.",
            "So, in essence, what the learned Member is actually asking is for this council to serve the Opposition Members because the PAP Members are not asking for this, and the Government does not need it. So, effectively, it is a request for a $20 million fiscal council to assist the Opposition Members with their proposals. Effectively, that is what it is.",

            ": Thank you, Mr Chairman. Just two clarifications for Minister Lawrence Wong. I thank the Minister for responding in detail to my MOF cuts.",
            "The first one is on the National Research Foundation. I think the Minister referred to some of the downstream outcomes. For example, four of the top 10 blockbuster drugs in the world are manufactured in Singapore. I believe those four are by MNCs though. So, my question would be, really, in terms of local companies, locally owned companies, does the NRF actually track the IP that its spending has resulted in, the IP that is co-created with local companies, and does it track whether that IP then is used to create a blockbuster drug or a blockbuster product by the local company itself further downstream? Is that something that the NRF looks at?",
            "I accept, of course, that there are different uses for research, not just one. But is that dimension kind of being tracked or will it be tracked, going forward? I know that these results take time to manifest. I believe NRF was set up in 2002 or 2003, so it has been 17 or 18 years. So, I am wondering if that is being tracked, examples of that.",
            "Secondly, in relation assessing performance of Temasek and GIC, the Minister helpfully shared about advisory councils that help to guide Temasek and GIC. So, my question is, really, that the Government in the form of MOF is the sole shareholder, basically, of GIC and Temasek, and as the sole shareholder, is there a process within the MOF where you assess whether their performance is good enough?",
            "In past debates on this subject, I believe that the Government has said its approach is a bit hands-off; it leaves it to the Board and management. But I am wondering whether there is a formal process every year or every few years to assess whether the Board and management have done well or whether they have done not well enough, so that they need to be taken to task or, in extremis, whether they need to be replaced. Does that sort of happen within MOF or somewhere else in the Government?"

            ": Mr Chairman, let me take the two questions from Mr Perera.",
            "On the first question, the translation from research to economic output, and whether or not local companies themselves are benefiting from this, this is indeed something we do track. It takes longer, understandably, because the capabilities of our local firms may not be at the same level as MNCs. So, their readiness to take research and to translate research into tangible outcomes may not quite be there. So, there is an on-going effort to transform industries to boost the capabilities of our local firms. That is one prong.",
            "But a second prong of this is through NRF's research initiatives itself, some of these get translated into local start-ups, and then these start-ups, in the nature of start-ups, not every one will succeed. Some may exit early but we certainly hope some of them, over time, will grow and be very successful companies. And because we are still relatively early in this journey, I think we do need patience.",
            "Just to give an example of a successful start-up like that which came from research in one of our universities. Members would have read about Nanofilm that was listed recently. This was a project that started from a R&D project in NTU, I think, in 1999; that long ago. And only recently, it got listed.",
            "That is the kind of gestation periods that we are talking about. We are tracking this; we are certainly wanting more translational outcomes that will benefit our economy and local firms. But I ask for patience from everyone, even as we track this effort on a continuing basis and strive for better outcomes.",
            "Second, on evaluation performance of both Temasek and GIC, the Government continually reviews the performances of these two entities. There is a whole range of processes that we have put in place to do this.",
            "First of all, oversight by the Boards which they ought to do as part of their fiduciary duties. The Boards take this very seriously. Both entities have advisory panels, as I have highlighted, and that also provides guidance and oversight. MOF itself has a review process where we meet the Board and management of Temasek on a regular basis. We get them to update us on their understanding of the overall scenario, the risks, the outlook and opportunities they can envisage over the horizon, and what kinds of investment strategies they have in mind.",
            "And then on top of all that, at the end of the day, it all comes down to the returns, and based on the risks that they are taking, the returns that they are delivering. As I have highlighted, we look at these returns not just on a yearly basis. I think that would be very short-sighted and that would be detrimental and counter-productive. We look at it on an overall basis and over a longer term. It is really rolling returns over a longer period of time, preferably over 20 years, which we do, but then we have intermediate milestones and we look at 10 and five-year periods as well. That is the ultimate test. That they are able to deliver consistently good returns over the longer term.",

To support the expansion of the preschool sector, we will continue to put in place measures to attract more people, both men and women, to join the sector.",
            "For instance, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) offers Training Awards to encourage post-Secondary students to pursue Early Childhood courses at the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC).

            "We believe that male educators can also play a valuable role in preschools, and that they bring different strengths and perspectives to the sector. They can offer male role models for children and emphasise the role men can play in supporting the development of children in their early years. As the preschool sector continues to expand, there are growing areas of specialisation such as Mother Tongue Language, Outdoor Learning, and socio-emotional development, where male educators can contribute meaningfully to our children’s learning.",

While early childhood educators are professionals who play a critical role in the holistic development of our children, there are misperceptions that the early childhood sector is associated with caregiving and is more suited for women. ECDA has been working to change these misperceptions. For instance, since 2018, ECDA has embarked on a national campaign for the early childhood sector to create greater awareness of the sector and career opportunities, and to foster greater respect and recognition of the profession. It is a journey to change misperceptions, and we will continue to work towards a better balance of male and female preschool educators over time, as we collectively debunk stereotypes and encourage mindset shifts."

As an additional safeguard, insurers are required to clearly explain these changes to their policyholders at least 30 days before they take effect.",
            "To provide their policyholders more assurance after these changes, we understand that some insurers have also introduced co-payment limits for treatments that are provided by their panel doctors, or for pre-authorised treatments. Policyholders can also continue to tap on MediSave to pay the co-payment amount under their riders, subject to the MediSave withdrawal limits.",

MOH will continue to work with all stakeholders to encourage appropriate and cost-effective treatment."

This is because the vehicles tend to protrude from the car lot and obstruct the view of other car park users, block passengers in vehicles next to theirs from opening their doors, or generate noise and air pollution that impacts residents.",

Maintenance checks on such facilities are therefore carried out by the respective Town Councils, who will decide on the schedule and frequency of such checks.",
            "Community spaces such as playgrounds and fitness corners in HDB estates are generally designed to be inclusive and accessible to all. For instance, main footpath routes along these community spaces are designed to be barrier-free, taking reference from the Building & Construction Authority (BCA)'s code of accessibility in the built environment. The selection of playground equipment within playgrounds in HDB estates is also guided by the Singapore Standard SS457:2017, which provides specifications for playground equipment that is for public use. Under this standard, playground equipment should be barrier-free and accessible by the physically challenged.",
            "All playgrounds in HDB developments since the 2000s are designed to be accessible to wheelchair users and children with different physical abilities and needs. For instance, wheelchair users are able to access ground-level equipment such as play counters and seesaws, as well as play on elevated platforms and slides via transfer platforms and accessible stairways with assistance. Wheelchair-friendly fitness equipment is also provided at elderly fitness corners in new HDB developments since the 2000s. The chest press, for instance, provides strength training and can be accessed directly by wheelchair users.",
            "With the ageing population in Singapore, HDB is looking into various aspects of health and wellness to enhance residents' physical, social and mental well-being. For older HDB developments, playgrounds and fitness corners that are designed to be accessible to all can be introduced through upgrading programmes. For instance, improvement works under the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) include the replacement of existing playgrounds and fitness corners, and the construction of new ones in existing HDB precincts. A recent initiative that is steadily being implemented in new HDB developments is the introduction of pictograms on precinct signage to help the elderly and those with dementia to better understand the signage.",
            "HDB recognises the diverse demographics and varying needs of HDB residents, and will continue to plan and design new HDB developments to be universally enjoyed by all."
